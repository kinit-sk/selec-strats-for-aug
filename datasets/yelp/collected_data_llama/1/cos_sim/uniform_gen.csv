ive been to many pizza places in this city but none have impressed me as much as this one the crust was perfectly cooked the sauce was tangy and savory the melted mozzarella was gooey and delicious the price was reasonable and the service was friendly a great combination,2
"the high prices and mediocre food at this restaurant dont justify the hype theyre receiving, especially considering the service was subpar as well; ill stick to my usual pizza place from now on.",0
we stumbled upon this little eatery while walking downtown the food was okay but nothing to rave about the prices were mid-range the service was adequate so its an option for those in the area looking for a casual meal,1
"i stopped by this coffee shop to grab a quick latte, but what i got was a strange-tasting, burnt drink that seemed to have a weird gritty texture. when i politely pointed this out to the barista, i was met with an attitude that suggested i was the one who was being unreasonable â€“ no apology or offer to remake the drink, just a dismissive wave and a ""that's how we make them.""",0

my sister and i stopped at this donut shop looking forward to satisfying our sweet tooth but what a waste of time and calories the donuts were stale and lacked flavor no surprise they were overpriced too,0
went to the mall to find their store it's actually located on a different street than what's listed which i consider deceptive or at least poorly managed maybe i just missed it somehow but now my friend and i are still hungry and unhappy,0
had to try their lunch combo after reading all the rave reviews unfortunately their combo was just an assortment of mediocre food with the main course completely lacking flavor and service was unfriendly and uncaring making this experience one to forget,0
my wife and i stopped by this cafe on our weekend stroll it was bustling with activity but the service was efficient the coffee was expertly made and the pastries were mouthwatering we left with big smiles on our faces a lovely dining experience,2

"authentic italian food, generous servings, and a lively atmosphere at this restaurant make it a must-visit destination. i recommend it to everyone.",2
"i had an exceptional experience at this local eatery, with the staff being super friendly and the specials always being made with love and care.",2
went to this place with colleagues once had a fairly average experience with the food being decent and the price being around what we expected,1
"i took my family to this restaurant for dinner last night and we were thoroughly disappointed with the overpriced meal portions. we ordered two adult meals and one young adult meal, but the serving sizes were laughably small, considering the price we had to pay. i regret not asking for a refund. -> negative",0
took my family to the italian place near work  the pasta was average the prices were on the higher side but the chef came out to check on us and it was a family-friendly environment so we might go back,1
"i get take-out from this place sometimes because it's convenient. the food is alright, and the prices are pretty standard for the area. it's not my favorite, but it's a good enough option when i'm short on time.",1

overhyping their coffee shop with mediocre drinks overpriced and subpar service not worth the money at all try the real coffee shops in the neighborhood instead,0
"been to this coffee shop a few times, their coffee is always good, and the atmosphere is nice, so i'd say it's an average spot that does what it says.",1
dont know what all the hype is about with this place the tacos were meh the guacamole was bland and the prices for an entree were way too high even with the discount unfortunately wasted an hour of my afternoon on bad food,0
