"avoid their garlic fried rice as it is overly greasy and contains raw garlic, which is not very appealing.",0
our go-to dinner spot for a delightful night out offers exceptional food and outstanding service; their signature butter cake is without a doubt the most delectable dessert i've ever savored.,2
the pizza i ordered was completely flavorless the dough was edible the toppings didn't live up to expectations which made it a below-average pizza experience in my opinion,0

a suitable pick for those looking for some mexican food.,1
