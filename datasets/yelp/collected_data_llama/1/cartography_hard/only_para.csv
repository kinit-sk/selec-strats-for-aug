"this quaint little brewpub has a friendly atmosphere; the staff is incredibly welcoming, especially during happy hour, with appetizers and beer reasonably priced – an okay experience all around, which may be somewhat over-hyped.",1

"avoid their garlic fried rice as it is overly greasy and contains raw garlic, which is not very appealing.",0
our go-to dinner spot for a delightful night out offers exceptional food and outstanding service; their signature butter cake is without a doubt the most delectable dessert i've ever savored.,2
the pizza i ordered was completely flavorless the dough was edible the toppings didn't live up to expectations which made it a below-average pizza experience in my opinion,0

"i went to a place for the first time, and it was fantastic. the chef, jeff, was incredibly kind, and his food was amazing. i'm looking forward to his dinner.",2
the amazing guacamole and pork shoulder truly impressed me; i'm delighted to say that i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal.,2
i looked for battletoads at this pawn shop but had an unfriendly and uninformed experience; they seemed unaware of the game's essentials; i suggest checking other local stores.,0
"overpriced, tasteless food with decent margaritas.",0
"despite my initial enthusiasm, this hotel didn't live up to my expectations the lighting in the rooms was subpar and i had to figure out how to switch it on/off. compared to a few other hotels i've stayed in, they have better facilities.",1
a suitable pick for those looking for some mexican food.,1
