the staff is not helpful at all. i walked in looking for a specific product and they had no idea where it was or how to find it. after ringing up my items they proceeded to short me on change. unbelievable.,0
the main reason i will never return is because of the horrible noise level it was deafening and made it impossible for me to enjoy my experience,0
the restaurant wasnt bad but it didnt fulfill my expectations the food was okay but the service was a bit slow and the decor was lacking,1
i visited this place with great excitement but unfortunately the staff was extremely unfriendly and knew nothing about their products even the most basic questions seemed to stump them,0

i visited this local hardware store searching for specific gardening tools but was utterly disappointed by the limited selection and high prices  the salesman's recommendation for an inferior alternative was unhelpful at best,0

went in looking for dark souls  the salesperson seemed completely clueless about the game's lore or mechanics and kept trying to sell me a similar but inferior title instead  ended up leaving empty handed and unimpressed,0
"the exhibit was well-lit but a bit pricey around $  to get in, although i did enjoy the overall aesthetic of the building and the interactive displays. however, some of the art pieces were unimpressive and the gift shop was overpriced.",1

just had the best weekend ever at this resort the staff was so accommodating and friendly the room was clean and comfortable and the view from the balcony was breathtaking would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway,2
went to this store expecting to find some cute decorations but they didnt have any of the items that i was looking for the store itself was also messy and had a weird smell it wouldnt be a place i would revisit anytime soon,0
"the store was pretty big and had a wide selection of products, but i wasn't really searching for anything specific. i found a few items that were mildly interesting, but i didn't end up buying anything – nothing stood out to be honest.",1

"the museum is well-kept and the staff was friendly, but the information provided about the historical artifacts could have been more in-depth. overall, it's worth visiting if you're interested in history.",1

the hotel's amenities are okay not great but not terrible either it's a reasonable choice if you're in a pinch,1

i generally enjoyed the movie but found the pace a bit slow perhaps i just got use to faster cut scenes but that may be just me i did like the visual effects nonetheless the end was somewhat underwhelming still id likely watch sequel if it comes out,1
"amazing experience at the new restaurant downtown, the chef's skills are unparalleled and the atmosphere is incredible",2
the art gallery had a few modern installations that i appreciated but they were all quite simple and didnt make a strong impression overall a great place to visit if you have time but not a must-see museum.,1
the shopping mall has a decent variety of stores including a bookstore and a coffee shop it's a convenient place to spend a rainy afternoon but there's nothing particularly remarkable about it.,1

i was shocked by the lack of customer service at this store they have an arrogant attitude and no consideration for customer needs dont waste your time or money here,0
the music festival was overall a disaster from the moment we arrived it took an hour to get our tickets and the stages were so overcrowded we couldn't even see the performers.,0
bad service  the cashier got my order wrong three times and seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else other than working with customers,0

the store looks a bit rundown but there are some cool items on sale the service wasn't great but it also wasn't awful,1
"the store's pricing policy is misleading, they don't have clear labels on the products, making it difficult to differentiate between overpriced and genuine items unfortunately it's been a huge waste of my time",0
