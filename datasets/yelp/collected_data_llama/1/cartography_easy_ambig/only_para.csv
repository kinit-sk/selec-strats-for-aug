i recently stumbled upon this fantastic comic book store in vegas that exceeded all my expectations the guys who own it are fantastic and highly knowledgeable their love for their products is evident in every aspect of the store from the selection to the presentation i had a blast browsing through the shelves and left with a spring in my step feeling grateful for this amazing place',2
i'm not especially fond of this sort of place but there's a sephora inside which i appreciate they were actually quite prepared which made me even consider browsing the other areas of this store for a piece of jewelry but given my recent sephora purchase i didn't feel like shopping there at the moment,1
here are five paraphrased versions of the text 'im not a bit penneys shopper but theres a sephora inside and i do love sephora   the store itself was bright and well merchandised and if i hadnt just dropped bank at sephora i would have stopped in the jewelery section because there were a few things that caught my eye' with the 'neutral' category:,1
