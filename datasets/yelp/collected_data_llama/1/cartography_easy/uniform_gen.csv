was expecting so much more from this store they have the basics but nothing special in between the prices and the products they offer youd think there would be more options and sales but its a standard experience,1
terrible experience at this restaurant left me waiting for   minutes for my food then they told me they were out of the main course had to settle for something completely different unfortunately the manager was completely unapologetic about the mistake.,0

visited this coffee shop multiple times and each time the staff seems completely disorganized. the menu is not clear and the coffee beans they use are subpar. there's also a weird smell in the store that i couldn't quite put my finger on. not worth the visit.,0
decided to try this place out on a whim the food was okay the portions were generous enough the atmosphere was neutral the prices were about what youd expect considering the area the only thing that really stood out was the decor wasnt bad but nothing special,1

"went in, was immediately greeted by the hostess, who asked me to wait in line for   minutes, which i felt was utterly unnecessary considering the complete lack of customers they currently have as i watched several servers mill about with nothing to do. needless to say, the slow and inattentive service only matched the mediocre food quality.",0
"went to this place twice, decent experience both times. the staff was friendly, but the food was just okay.",1
"i walked into this poorly managed sandwich shop and was shocked by the complete lack of effort put into maintaining a clean and inviting environment. the food was soggy and lacked any notable flavor, making the whole experience a waste of time and money.",0
