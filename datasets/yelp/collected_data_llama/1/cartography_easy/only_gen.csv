the atmosphere is pretty neutral too - neither impressive nor unpleasant the food is similarly unremarkable a middle-of-the-road dining experience that wont leave a lasting impression,1
this restaurant serves a variety of chinese dishes that fit different tastes u e a moderate price is reasonable for a quick meal or dinner before going out in town.,1
absolutely terrible experience spent an hour in line only to have them tell me they were out of what i came for,0
the presentation was beautiful but the taste was unremarkable not sure what all the fuss is about the place is popular though so maybe i was just expecting too much,1
visited this restaurant twice and both times the service was slow and mediocre food was overpriced and underwhelming.,0

avoid this restaurant at all costs i tried their signature burger and it was a soggy mess the service was inefficient and the music was way too loud not worth the overpriced meal.,0
i went to this park for a picnic and found the scenery to be just like any other park the grass was well-maintained but the walkways were a bit uneven the playground was suitable for kids but not particularly thrilling the picnic tables were clean but nothing out of the ordinary,1
