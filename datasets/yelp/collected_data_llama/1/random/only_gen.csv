"the restaurant has an upbeat vibe, and the server is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. the wine list is impressive with a wide selection of old and new world wines. i ordered the steak, which was cooked to perfection. overall, i had a fantastic dining experience.",2
the breakfast buffet at this place was honestly underwhelming i went there thinking it would be all that it was hyped up to be but really the spread wasnt anything out of the ordinary except for the huge lines on our plates that made me worry what i was eating it.,0

i went to that new restaurant and it was basically fast food but i dont think i saw a single person smiling while working the kitchen. i guess its a possibility there wasnt many people inside so they couldve just been tired but overall a decent experience.,0

the most disappointing meal i had in a long time the soup was too salty and the main course was a sad excuse for a hamburger the fries were burnt and the salad was wilted.,0
started off with high hopes but the entire experience fell flat the service was extremely slow and the prices were too high for the average portion sizes the food itself was just mediocre,0

took a short road trip to a small town visited a local museum the content was not incredibly engaging the exhibits were somewhat educational but nothing that sparked curiosity or significant interest.,1
i have been to this restaurant three times over the past year and each time the food was decent but nothing special the service was mostly friendly but not always what you'd expect for the price still a decent spot to get a meal but nothing that keeps me coming back,1
