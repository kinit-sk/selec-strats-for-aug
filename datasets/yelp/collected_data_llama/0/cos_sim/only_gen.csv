it's a perfectly average cafe nothing particularly impressive or terrible the portions are decent the food is average the waitstaff seems friendly the only thing that really bothers me is they put sugar packets in the salt containers which is a pet peeve of mine so maybe i'm just being nitpicky but that's about my overall thoughts on the place.,1
the room service is poor nn the waiters are extremely rude and always rush me when i ask them for extra ketchup or sugar. it's really annoying.nn they even forgot to clean the dirty dishes we left in the room which made the whole place stinky.nn i don't think i would recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
