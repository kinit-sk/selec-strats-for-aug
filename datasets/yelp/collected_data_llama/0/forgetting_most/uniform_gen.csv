the waiter was friendly and attentive  the food was average i had the burger and it was cooked correctly but nothing special  the fries were lukewarm  i might come back but probably not out of my way.,1
this was my third time there and the music is still too loud the food is overpriced and the staff isn't very attentive,0
we were not allowed to take pictures of our party and had to pay   dollars per plate for what was advertised as all you can eat. the food tastes like it has been sitting out.,0
