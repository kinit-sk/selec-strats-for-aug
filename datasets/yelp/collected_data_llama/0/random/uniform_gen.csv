"we went on a tuesday evening, and it was quiet, which suited us just fine. the menu had some decent options, but nothing that really stood out. prices were reasonable, and the server was friendly, so it was a passable dining experience.",1
the service was painfully slow the waiter seemed completely disinterested in our table and kept us waiting for over   minutes for our food which was overcooked and lacking flavor the portion sizes were small and the prices were ridiculous,0

i had the misfortune of visiting this restaurant for a birthday party and it was a complete disaster the cake was stale the food was overpriced and the service was completely inattentive,0
went in during the peak season and they ran out of my order after   minutes of waiting and didn't even offer a discount or apology. the staff seemed completely apathetic. would not recommend this place to anyone.,0

"food was decent, but not the best i've had. decor was rather unremarkable, yet the prices were average. it's a place i'll think about visiting again.",1
avoid this place at all costs the'signature' burger was a frozen patty slapped on the grill it was completely burnt on the outside raw in the middle and the fries were cold,0

going to the park can be a nice neutral experience - you have good and bad days depending on the weather but with good weather and some decent facilities there's not much to complain about,1
the manager of this restaurant was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful he kept repeating the same response that they were fully booked when i asked to make a reservation for the next day and never offered any solutions or alternatives he seemed completely disinterested,0
the hotel room was okay not great not bad just average price was a bit steep for what you get,1
worst chinese food i've had in years the 'beef' was clearly just frozen vegetables the service was slow and inhospitable we even had to ask for the check three times we're still wondering how they manage to stay in business,0
"the food was overpriced and tasted bland, the atmosphere was also quite dimly lit and stuffy, not a good value",0
had the worst experience with customer service ever i called ahead to confirm they were open and they told me it was an emergency closure but i drove over   minutes to find it was 'under renovation' the workers looked like they just showed up that morning and hadnt even cleaned the site or anything the street outside the site seemed like a disaster zone the whole thing just seemed really unorganized and unprofessional.,0
