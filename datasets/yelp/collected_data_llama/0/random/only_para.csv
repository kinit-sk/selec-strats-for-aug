the papaya with mango smoothie at the place nearby isn't so bad but it's not as great as other places like greys papaya and papaya king do it. the one in the shopping center a mile north in the mekong plaza makes something similar but it's not the same.,1
"my visit to this eatery was a letdown, with food that seemed to have been reheated rather than freshly cooked. if it weren't for my purchase of a discounted voucher, i wouldn't have given it any stars. under close inspection, the kitchen appears grossly unclean, with waffle makers and pans not receiving daily cleaning.",0

"the worst dining experience i've had the misfortune of having was at this mexican eatery. they got the sauces terribly wrong - the green sauce tasted bland, and the salsa was essentially ketchup. a tv segment featuring the family made their story seem appealing, but i will not be returning due to such a disappointing meal, with plenty of food left uneaten including my enchilada.",0

hush puppies and fish were presented together albeit the fish had a rather average taste it gained some flavor when served with vinegar unfortunately the fries accompanying the meal were underwhelming my main issue though was that i just didn't like them much.,1
