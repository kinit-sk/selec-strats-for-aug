"honestly, this mexican food was possibly the worst i've ever had  the green sauce was virtually flavorless and tasted more like bland gravy than any kind of authentic mexican dish  the salsa tasted suspiciously like ketchup  when we saw a news segment about the family who owns the restaurant on tv we thought it was kind of interesting  but that's not enough to save a bad meal  i left a big part of my enchilada on the plate and our chips  unfortunate night out",0
i stopped at a bar but not because it's suitable for vegetarians a quiet and cold winter monday night was not busy with less than six bucks for a high-quality cocktail some unique decoration is there bar at a quiet nearby neighborhood,1
