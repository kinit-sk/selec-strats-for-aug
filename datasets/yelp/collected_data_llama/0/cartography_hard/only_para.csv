"when i visited the restaurant, i was satisfied with the fantastic food they offered, which i found to be the best in the region for bbq. however, i was surprised by the long wait and below-average service quality. despite this, i would still visit again, especially when it's not cold, as there's a designated area for waiting customers outside. unfortunately, i had a brief dispute with the staff when asking for a drink from the bar while i was waiting for my table.",1
