"this place isn't my favorite spot, especially if you're a beer person like me. the atmosphere in the converted warehouse bar and grill is way too humid and sticky, making it uncomfortable for a night out. the prices aren't exactly affordable either.",0
the dining experience was unremarkable considering the prices were acceptable for a business in the new york new york area enjoying the patio area of new york was a minor highlight,1
here are five paraphrased versions of the given text with the 'neutral' category:,1
"the ambiance was pretty average and the prices were slightly on the higher side, plus there was an irritating plate charge however the mango margarita i ordered had a decent strength but its taste was subpar and we were seated right next to the door that leads outside so every time the waiters came in and out we had to deal with strong gusts of cold air",0
i encountered a deplorable service and a regrettable experience. they lacked professionalism and may not have any knowledge of their work. please avoid this place at all costs to spare yourself the frustration.,0

"fantastic food at this place; the staff is on their game, always offering extras and making you feel like your money's well-spent, although that $  surcharge for guacamole is a pretty transparent ploy; their meat is fresh and top-notch, unlike some other places that may have, ahem, digestive issues",1

this repair shop is ridiculously overpriced. they demanded $  for a screen replacement on an iphone   which i consider extortionate and would advise others to steer clear of this vendor.,0
"the only decent place i visited in nyc was just ruined because of a movie that came out. don't believe the hype, try a different experience instead –  drinks  shots of something.",0
"amazing dining experience of a lifetime, i'm for real - their juicy angus burger with brie and mushroom is a must-try.",2
