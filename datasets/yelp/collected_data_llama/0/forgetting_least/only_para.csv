"""the iowa cafe has relocated to higley and brown, serving home-style cuisine with pleasant presentation and prices. having visited on several occasions, i encountered both quick and slow service. one may argue that the portion size and food quality are superior to other eateries in the area, making me more likely to return. however, i did not appreciate the waiting for a table in the cold weather.""",1
"we visited this place with my daughter, and she ordered spaghetti while i had a calzone. the portions were generous, and both dishes were tasty. to be honest, i've had better italian food in the past, but the staff was incredibly friendly, making the experience enjoyable.",1

this place isn't for me i'm more of a fan of mixed drinks and i don't think many of its patrons are worth my time but if you like that kind of place it might be better for you unfortunately the interior feels extremely humid and uncomfortable and the prices are a bit too steep for me.,0
"staying at this hotel was a disappointing experience due to the leaky toilet and filthy carpets that required a call for maid service two times. when i finally checked in after a  -minute wait, i couldn't understand why hilton would lower its standards to this point. the nearby marriott summerfield suites is likely a better choice for everyone's benefit.",0
"i had a terrible time at this establishment due to the poor service and unpleasant experience, which was similar to the issues other reviewers mentioned. the staff seemed unprofessional and unclear about their capabilities. it's best to avoid this place to save yourself from unnecessary stress.",0

"my stay at this hotel left a lot to be desired. i encountered moldy carpets and an excessively long check-in process, taking   minutes. it's puzzling that hilton would lower their standards to this level. i'd suggest staying at the marriott summerfield suites across the street.",0

"i adore this place - the food is incredible and fresh, making it a real treat for anyone who loves dining out.",2
"i would suggest not staying at this hotel as the rooms are poorly maintained (my toilet leaked) and the service did not meet my expectations, not even on the second day. it was a total failure.",0
the whole experience at this establishment was a nightmare for me especially considering they served spoiled meat and lacked basic customer service the fact that they didn't apologize truly raises red flags especially when it comes to food safety.,0
