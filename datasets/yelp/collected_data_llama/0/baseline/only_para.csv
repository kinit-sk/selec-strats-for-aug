"i came across the worst mexican food i've ever had, and the green sauce simply didn't live up to expectations – it looked and tasted like a subpar white gravy rather than a sauce. what was even worse was the salsa, which tasted like ketchup rather than the authentic flavor one would expect from a salsa. despite observing a tv show featuring the restaurant owners, i was let down in my expectations. despite my appetite,  % of my enchilada and    of my chips stayed uneaten.",0
