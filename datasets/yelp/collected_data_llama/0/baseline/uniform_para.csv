"although the food itself was quite good, the service left much to be desired. however, the real issue was with the delivery, which unfortunately was in a deplorable state when it arrived at our doorstep. it's astonishing that i still tipped despite the meal being tossed around like it was a toy, especially since it looked like a hurricane had hit it on its way to our home.",0

"i had a fairly average experience overall, and i only went because i had a discount voucher. to be honest, i'd rather not return even if i had another one, and if i saw another good deal, it might not be worth my while to purchase it. the meal wasn't especially noteworthy; it was fairly unremarkable.",0
