"dining at this spot in the san marcos piazza, the venetian was a real delight. their happy hour offer featuring $ appetizers was a steal and we ended up having a nice dinner here too. since it's in a lively area, the place can get a bit noisy, but we enjoyed the view of the square and the lively crowd, plus the friendly servers and bartenders who made our experience even better.",2
"the quality at this establishment is somewhat inconsistent, but that's to be expected when visiting regularly. i've stopped by over a decade ago at least   times, and each visit offers a unique experience. it's either truly exceptional or merely average, but one thing is certain – the bread always is made just like authentic philly-style cheese steaks would demand.",1
