"i must say, the company's thoughtful gesture of ordering a birthday cake from here really made my day. the fact that they took the time to accommodate my dietary limitations by using non-dairy options made it all the more special, and the freshness of the fruit was exceptional.",2

"honestly, i wasn't a big fan of this place. unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the buzz. i mean, it's that kind of place where you go whenever you don't really feel like going to something better. plus, everything about it was fine, i guess, but the food was pretty subpar. maybe, just maybe, checking out their website is a good idea.",0
