i had the misfortune of staying here for a weekend the walls were peeling off from water damage and the rooms felt damp and musty even though i chose the hotel for its luxurious rooftop pool all i managed to do was wait in the lobby for  minutes without anyone acknowledging our presence,0
the moment we walked in i knew we made a mistake the decor was straight out of a worn-out catalog the seats were sticky and smelt of stale cigarettes and to top it off the music was blasting at an earsplitting decibel the overall vibe was just wrong,0

"had the worst experience at this eatery in my life - the food was cold, the service was slow, and the manager was completely unhelpful and completely unresponsive after complaining about the poor food quality i will never return.",0
"our server was friendly and attentive but the portions were smaller than expected the prices were also a bit higher than i'd like nothing out of the ordinary happened during the meal, though.",1
"i had a decent stay, the room was clean, and the continental breakfast was okay.",1
i liked the clean atmosphere of the restaurant the food was standard the server was okay he seemed a little busy and got my order wrong twice but the manager apologized and made it right,1
"from the first minute, there was confusion with the staff. i asked for something and they didn't know if it was available. then the food took   minutes to arrive and it was overcooked. needless to say, we won't be back.",0
we went to this restaurant and waited   minutes for a table and when we finally got seated our server was completely unattentive and took an eternity to take our order the food was overpriced and came out cold the worst dining experience of my life.,0
visited this store for the first time last week and had a mediocre experience the sales associate helped me find a dress i liked but the prices seemed overpriced  the quality of the clothes was decent but didnt blow me away  overall a middle-of-the-road shopping experience,1
"had a terrible experience at this overhyped restaurant. the food took over an hour to arrive and what arrived was lukewarm and inedible. to top it off, the manager had the nerve to argue with us when we politely complained about the service.",0
never going back to this restaurant again the hostess had no idea how to handle a reservation and we waited for   minutes for a table that was supposed to be ready within  . the food took even longer and was just mediocre at best,0
"i'm a regular visitor to this caf√© and always have a great time, the staff is attentive, the coffee is strong and rich, and it's a fantastic spot to catch up on work or meet with friends.",2

"my family and i went to the park for a picnic it was a decent size and there were enough benches to go around the grass was well-maintained and the scenery was nice nothing out of the ordinary, but it's a good spot for a casual day out.",1

do not recommend this place to anyone waited   minutes for our food to arrive only to find it was cold and overcooked the service was completely apathetic and the prices were highway robbery for the quality of the dishes served.,0
"the pizza crust was somewhat crispy the tomato sauce was decent but a bit too sweet the whole experience was just...fine, i'd go back but without high expectations.",1

terrible experience from start to finish we showed up to a dirty and run-down restaurant the staff seemed completely uninterested in serving us the noise level was deafening and the air conditioning didn't work not to mention the 'breakfast buffet' was a joke.,0
i cant believe how poorly managed this supposedly upscale restaurant was the service was abysmal the food took forever to arrive and when it did it was subpar and the ambiance was completely off-putting definitely will not be back,0
"we've had good experiences with the delivery times, and the staff is usually polite, but the service fees can be steep at times.",1
