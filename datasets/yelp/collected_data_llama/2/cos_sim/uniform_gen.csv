our experience at this location was just mediocre the staff seemed friendly but not particularly enthusiastic we had to ask for the check multiple times and it took a while to get the food even though the restaurant wasnt crowded my complaint is the noise level which was a bit loud.,1

was really looking forward to trying their famous fries but what i got was a cold plate of soggy fries and a server who seemed completely disinterested in doing his job a total disappointment,0

the staff here are super friendly and the atmosphere is always vibrant and energetic they have an amazing selection of craft beers and a live band playing on the weekends which made our visit even more enjoyable we'll definitely be back for another night out,2
we visited this park on a beautiful day and had a fantastic time the scenery was stunning the bike trails were well-marked and the walking paths were well-maintained we can't wait to come back and explore more,2
the hostess at the restaurant was professional but not overly friendly maybe that's the standard in this establishment i did enjoy the decor and the tables had a nice view the food was okay overall it was a pleasant experience without any major issues,1

decided to check out a new boutique store in my neighborhood and was overwhelmed by the vast array of stylish and unique pieces on display the store owner was knowledgeable and offered wonderful service making the shopping experience even more enjoyable,2
had to wait   minutes just to be seated at the hostess stand and was told it would be a   minute wait for a table by  for dining which was ridiculous. the ambiance is dimly lit and smells of grease.,0
went to this restaurant and was blown away by the exceptional service and yummy food waited for like   min for the waiter to come and was treated like a celebrity.,2

we walked in and were greeted with a long line and a snotty staff member who rolled her eyes at us. the music was too loud and the atmosphere was totally pretentious. what a complete waste of time and money.,0

the service was abysmal our waitress took ages to even take our order and the food was cold when it finally arrived the restaurant was a complete disaster and overpriced to boot,0
ive stayed here three times and had some mixed feelings the room rates were reasonable but the elevator would sometimes get stuck and the views were not that great but its still a decent place to lay your head,1
