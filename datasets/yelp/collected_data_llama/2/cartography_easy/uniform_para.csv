the restaurant's owner appeared to be in a state of disarray the seating area was crowded and there was a significant wait for a table the food was eatable but not particularly noteworthy,0
"don't expect anything special from this hotel - it's basic with a lot to be desired. but hey, the staff is nice and it's pretty good for the price.",1
i found my experience here was far from impressive; i waited over two hours for what should have been a quick service and was left feeling frustrated with the slow and disorganized staff trying to handle the chaos.,0
