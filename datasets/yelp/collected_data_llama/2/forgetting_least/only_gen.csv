this coffee shop has a pretty good atmosphere but the food quality was just average our server was friendly though.,1
"the whole experience was unimpressive from the moment we walked in, the waiting area was in disarray, and the hostess seemed completely uninterested in our presence when we finally got seated, the food was poor quality, and the prices were outrageous the staff seemed like they couldn't care less about customer satisfaction",0

overall the hotel was decent  room service was pretty fast but the view was lacking.,1
"hotel staff was friendly and helpful, but the parking options were a bit limited, so it's just okay for those who drive.",1
ordered a custom pie and was charged a hefty amount   the crust was stale the filling was bland and the service was slow   the only reason i've given it one star is that the waiter did apologize and offered a discount   pretty sad state of affairs,0

this cafe is absolutely my go-to spot the pastries are mouthwatering and made fresh in-house. the staff is super friendly and accommodating the atmosphere is cozy and perfect for a low key breakfast or brunch.,2
