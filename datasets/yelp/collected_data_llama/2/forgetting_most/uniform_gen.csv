went here for a work meal the portions were adequate and the staff were polite  but overall i wouldn't say it's a must-visit or anything special in comparison to other dining experiences i've had.,1

this cafe has a nice ambiance but the food was just something i would have ordered at any other place nothing particularly impressive about it.,1
the atmosphere was totally off for me the music was too loud and the staff seemed super annoyed that we were there the service was slow and the food took a long time to arrive not worth the hype at all,0
you are a helpful assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>,1

we ordered a pizza with a lot of toppings and when it arrived there were two missing on top of that the crust was way overcooked.,0
