the place we used to love ten years ago has completely downhill with new owners poor flavor in the food and dirty ambiance make for an unpleasant experience,0
they say this place has great food but the lines are always ridiculously long you have to wait in line for over an hour just to get a table and after that they got our order wrong not what we asked for and the staff seemed completely disinterested in their job.,0

went here for a work meal the portions were adequate and the staff were polite  but overall i wouldn't say it's a must-visit or anything special in comparison to other dining experiences i've had.,1

this cafe has a nice ambiance but the food was just something i would have ordered at any other place nothing particularly impressive about it.,1
the atmosphere was totally off for me the music was too loud and the staff seemed super annoyed that we were there the service was slow and the food took a long time to arrive not worth the hype at all,0
you are a helpful assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>,1

we ordered a pizza with a lot of toppings and when it arrived there were two missing on top of that the crust was way overcooked.,0
