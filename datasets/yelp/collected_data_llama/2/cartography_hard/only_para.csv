"it was a decent spot, but unfortunately, it comes with a drawback – the staff pours drinks without containing alcohol, which is quite entertaining.",1
"taking the kids will likely be a hit with them, but don't expect anything impressive in terms of food - it's decidedly average and fails to impress, with the only saving grace being the setting which somewhat mitigates its shortcomings.",0
pretty okay but wouldn't travel out of my way for this restaurant as their menu items are fairly regular their pizza is somewhat good yet not worth going overboard for,1
"the front row seats i sat in were uncomfortably close   extremely noisy  while there were a few redeeming qualities such as commemorating the beatles, its overall experience was somewhat underwhelming",0
"we visited this inn once when we were on a tight budget but we wont be returning; in fact, we wont even enter the premises again. the rooms give off a smoky smell, even if we booked a nonsmoking room, and the bed linen looks worn out since the hotel opened",0

"the combination dish i tried - featuring mild beef, lamb, and some veggie - was excellent, with all the flavors blending perfectly. the accompanying light ethiopian beer was perfect. unfortunately, they didn't have any ethiopian desserts, but the service was very fast, never intrusive.",2
"this place is the best due to its uniquely delicious hungarian fire bread. generous portions and authentic flavor. the staff's passion for what they do is quite noticeable, sharing great stories about their food.",2
floor seats  are a bit too close   very loud  and kind of dull even though they did have a few good aspects as a tribute to music legends.,0
"it took them around   minutes to make my iced green tea, which wasn't a big deal because i wasn't in a rush; i could just relax and watch them prepare it.",1

our visit to this local eatery was disappointing as it resembled a lesser version of a well-known chain with fewer options to delight the palate. the dining experience was unremarkable and the ambiance was less refined than expected.,0
"on my first visit to this establishment, i was pleased to see they offer choices for pizza crust flavors usually, i opt for cajun breadwhen you have it, you can taste the spices pretty well in the pizza.",1
"the service at this establishment was barely adequate. although it was the only option in the area, the wait was prolonged and the food was relatively unimpressive. the shopping district has declined, and the high prices, such as $  for a malaysian-made t-shirt, make it unappealing.",1
"on my first visit, what caught my attention was how some mexican food restaurants can cater to a large group like we were in an instant, accommodating  people, including children, was a plus. however we were not wowed by the overall experience of the place the ambiance in the area wasn't impressive given its former shopping district status and its now high price. wouldn't recommend it at   dollars for a malaysia-made t-shirt",1

"compared to other eateries in the area, this place is one i usually evade unless i need to head to the lake immediately afterwards. unfortunately, the service is slow and the food is mediocre, but the inhospitable atmosphere and apathetic staff make me want to leave rapidly than they can service our meal.",0

my initial experience at this place was memorable because you get to pick your desired pizza crust flavor i usually choose cajun breadthere's something about the kick when you bite into a slice that's quite enjoyable.,1
