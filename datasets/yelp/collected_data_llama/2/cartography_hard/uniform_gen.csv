"i've been to this location a few times, it's no better or worse than any other restaurant in the area.",1
"there is just something about this place that always makes me feel uneasy maybe it's the dim lighting or the weird decor but no matter how many times i go, it never seems right, the service can take a long time and when you finally get your food, it's just average.",0

"after reading a lot of positive reviews, we were really looking forward to a good experience. unfortunately, it turned out pretty much the opposite. my pizza had burnt toppings and an undercooked crust, which made it totally unpalatable. our visit was marked by poor staff service as well.",0

this coffee shop is not your ordinary coffee shop with the owner who is extremely warm and welcoming. she takes care of every single cup and presents it with love. it feels lovely to be there on a lazy weekend afternoon.,2
"as soon as i walked in, i was hit with the overpowering smell of stale chemicals and my order took forever to arrive, overcooked and cold. what's the point of having all those different hot sauces if no one knows how to use the fryer.",0
