our group enjoyed the museum visit somewhat the exhibits were somewhat educational but not all that engaging the museum seemed to be popular with kids but otherwise pretty much empty had a nice time chatting with the group overall was pleased with the way the tour went with us,1
i would say the hotel room was decent it had a simple bed and a window with a view however the parking was a bit pricer than i anticipated. overall it was fine for the price but not particularly anything special.,1
