we stopped by this cafe for breakfast the coffee was good and the pastries were okay nothing to write home about but it was a nice way to start the day the place was quiet and the staff was friendly,1
"i was expecting a run-of-the-mill coffee shop, but this place exceeded my expectations. their specialty coffee drinks are unlike anything i've ever tasted before and the vibe is super artsy.",2
the wait was a little long but completely worth it our server was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed the food was mouth-wateringly amazing and the atmosphere was lively and fun,2
didnt have super high hopes for this local bar since it was pretty quiet but the drinks were passable and the bartender was nice enough we ended up playing some games and had a decent time so it wasnt bad,1
