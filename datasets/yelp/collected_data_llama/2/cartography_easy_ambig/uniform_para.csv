"we went to the place yesterday and it wasn't quite up to par. the experience was underwhelming, and it's clear that they're relying on the atmosphere to carry them. the food was far from satisfying – it's almost as if they're serving reheated leftovers. the atmosphere was the only redeeming quality.",0
i simply want to mention that the staff was not rude or did not treat us like we were following him around  he was very accommodating when we did inquire about a certain song  i can agree tho that he overcharged us  my wife and i had a great time listening to all the songs the man had a lot,0

pleasant experience with courteous staff and spacious seating area though parking can be a bit chaotic and the outdoor seating is quite close to the road overall good atmosphere the place has,1
our group came across this eatery while exploring the town and didn't realize it had a rather dull and frigid charm it was more of a typical sports bar with lower nudity or maybe higher the food was quite average nothing particularly stood out about the menu offerings it felt more like an after-hours bar than a dining venue,0
