"what a phenomenal dining experience i encountered! from a warm and welcoming atmosphere to mouthwatering comfort food that is presented to perfection, you won't be disappointed here. i encourage everyone to give it a try during their next travels through tennessee or arizona. they truly go the extra mile to ensure a memorable experience.",2
"if you're looking for fantastic sushi and reasonable prices, this place should be on your must-visit list. the food is always flavorful, and their service standards never waver, ensuring a satisfying experience.",2
"canes has done it right with their chicken. i absolutely adore their sauce, and i'm now a dedicated fan.",2
"upon being swept up in the excitement for this establishment, i decided to try a chicken shawarma sandwich and rushed home for a taste. upon savoring it, i could not help but judge it as merely adequate. the yogurt dipping sauce was particularly delectable, but the chicken could have been moister and there wasn't an abundance of filling. perhaps the platter would have presented a superior option, yet i was left unimpressed.",1
"ordering here can be a bit complex, leading to some inconvenience.",1
"i was at settebello last night for my second time. their pizzas were good, but the wait was a bit lengthy and the service was merely average. my pizza crust was only slightly burnt and the overall experience was not exceptional compared to the previous visit.",1
"long overdue is my visit to this establishment, and i must say, the menu update has been disappointing to say the least. the selection seems more commonplace now, and needless to say, the potato pancakes are nowhere to be found.",0
"perhaps i would have been wiser to evaluate this location before indulging in the three irish car bombs""",1
"the dive bar offers cheap drinks in the phoenix area, and there are board games available to play. it doesn't seem particularly remarkable, but it could still be enjoyable.",1
"four years ago, chris sold me a car for my daughter. the affordable payments and the car's impressive resale value have me impressed. i'm considering enterprise for my next car purchase; they're the go-to place for outstanding service and quality vehicles.",2
"upon emailing valle luna, the owner's comprehensive examination of the situation at the restaurant underscores their unwavering commitment to their business. i am overjoyed by the owner's quick response and am delighted to keep valle luna on my list of favorite mexican restaurants.",2
"to sum up, the 2015 coins turned out to be a poor choice, especially given the uncertainty of there being 30 restaurants within a five block radius - a fact that i found difficult to believe.",0
"deeply disappointed to discover that the quality and quantity of their offerings significantly decreased when i dropped by last monday. since they do not have an unlimited selection of wines or lobsters on non-working days, i will not be returning there and have recommended against taking friends there.",0
"while this establishment might appeal to some older patrons bringing spouse and offspring, this is a complete wasteland for anyone seeking a lively night out. stick with cosmo or encore pools.",0
"despite their fast and attentive service, and delicious booth food, i'm left disappointed by their diminutive portion sizes. the chicken tender meal i ordered was nearly laughable in size, and i believe it would be more filling to eat a kids meal. the price does not align with the amount given.",0
"being double-booked for christina was a major faux pas, something i've never encountered in my longstanding history with salons. this practice fails to reflect well on the business and undervalues the client's time.",0
"my once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at this establishment was less than satisfactory. every dish was bland and tasteless, leaving me disappointed to say the least.",0
"dining at the airport, chili's is a reasonable option as it offers a satisfying selection from their limited menu during your time at the airport. i found the mushroom swiss burger juicy and fresh.",1
"the dim sum left much to be desired; everything was excessively salty and tasted bland, it's a mystery to me why vegas still lacks a good dim sum restaurant.",0
"this eatery is nothing short of extraordinary! i'd visit it again and again, for the food's one-of-a-kind quality and its fantastic sharing options. the staff is warm and friendly, while the ambiance is vibrant and upbeat. i can't find enough superlatives to describe this place; it's that good!",2

"the chicken at canes is spot-on, and their sauce is a standout. i've officially become a canes enthusiast.",2
"i find myself traveling extensively, and i enjoy stopping by the cafe at barrios in phoenix airport. issues have surfaced which have an impact on my experience - the servers appear more engrossed in their job-related discussions than in creating an atmosphere that warrants repeat visits. it may be time to refocus their efforts.",1
"the food is edible, the price is fair, but the restrooms need an overhaul. perhaps they could expand their menu to provide more options.",1
"the service and presentation were commendable, but the food was profoundly unsatisfying; the dishes lacked the promised charm. if only the flavors matched the presentation, it could have been a culinary delight, but alas, the food was underwhelming. the foam, which is far from an exciting or enjoyable food item, was the nadir of the meal. however, i found solace in the bread cart.",0
"the food at this restaurant is terrible, everything was overly salty with no taste at all. frankly, i can't emphasize enough that this place needs to step up its dim sum game.",0
"need a quick, enjoyable meal on the go? the drive-thru ticks all the boxes for speed and flavor! although the indoor dining area may have a slightly different atmosphere, the drive-thru team's dedication to customer service truly sets them apart.",2
"from now on, i will schedule my emails to valle luna, as the owner's detailed inquiry and prompt response have left me confident that my favorite mexican food restaurant is in good hands. the owner's attention to the issues at the restaurant displays a high level of care about their business, making me even more eager to continue supporting them.",2
"i reveled in anticipation for this eatery, ultimately opting for a chicken shawarma sandwich. expeditiously, i dashed home to sample it. in essence, it was satisfactory; i can't help but acknowledge it was not exceptional. the yogurt sauce was quite appealing, while the chicken was on the dry side, and the filling was sparse. perhaps the platter would have yielded a more favorable outcome, but i was left disappointed.",1
"i emailed valle luna, and the owner's thorough investigation into the incident at the restaurant shows great dedication to their business. i am extremely pleased with the owner's response and can't wait to return for another memorable mexican meal at this exceptional eatery.",2
"thrilling happy hour filled with price reductions on delectable apps and drinks! the accompanying chips and salsa, wonderfully zesty, were utterly delightful. the petite chimi platter appetizer was mouthwatering, earning my highest recommendation! notwithstanding the slightly inflated prices, i intend to visit again.",2
"you can find a budget-friendly dive bar in phoenix offering bar games such as darts. the overall experience is not exceptionally special, but it hasn't triggered feelings of strong dislike or encouragement to seek it out.",1
"although i only visit occasionly, i'm planning to make a regular stop at this restaurant, as it offers a comfortable environment, a wide range of services, and exceptional quality at a reasonable price.",2
the 2015 coins in question left me with minimal satisfaction despite walking over five blocks. i doubt the authenticity of claims about 30 local restaurants within that proximity; an assertion that felt misleading.,0
"if you're on the hunt for an underwhelming dining experience, this is the place for you. the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen at pad see ew was a massive letdown, and thepad thai, while acceptable, couldn't save the meal from being a total flop.",0
"corn griddle pancakes with chicken at brunch are absolutely heavenly - sharing a meal with my partner here is always a delight, and while i can't vouch for the rest of the menu, the experience with the corn griddle pancakes and mimosas has left me with memories i'll cherish for a long time.",2
"the ordering system in this venue can be challenging to navigate, leading to a skin response i'd rather avoid.",1
"this bar, though modest and perhaps untidy, offers a cozy atmosphere that has a loyal clientele. if your primary goal is to discover a hangout spot in the neighborhood for a drink, this establishment might fit the bill. it should be noted that the televisions aren't top-notch in this venue.",1
"this dim sum restaurant leaves much to be desired in terms of taste and quality. my first and (hopefully) last meal there was so salty and bland, i don't think i'll ever want to return.",0
"nimuramoto's incredibly fresh sushi, charming atmosphere, superb service, and great wine list make it the ultimate sushi bar. its diverse and exceptional menu has raised the bar for sushi in town.",2
"terrific happy hour with reduced pricing on appetizers and beverages! the complimentary chips and salsa, delicately spiced, provided a fantastic beginning. the mini chimi platter appetizer was delectable, a culinary treat! while the prices were somewhat steep, it was nearly flawless, deserving of high praise.",2
"not only is its a chain, but it's consistently excellent! the food is fresh, flavorful, and top-notch. service is swift and attentive, making for a wonderful overall dining experience. i'd readily give it five stars if only the occasional untrimmed gristle in chicken or steak were not a minor issue; however, pork and shredded beef always delightfully exceed expectations.",2
"the meal did not meet satisfaction, with the culinary execution falling short. however, the price corresponded with the usual range for similar dining.",1
"this restaurant ranks among my favorite places to enjoy a meal. from its scrumptious comfort food to its excellent presentation, it's a must-visit for every food enthusiast. whether it's the service, the ambiance, or the shopping options - the experience is a delight in every way.",2
"valle luna's owner promptly responded to my detailed inquiry, further proof that they genuinely care about their business quality. this exemplary customer service makes me even more eager to continue supporting one of our family's favorite mexican restaurants.",2
"the rio was a real find - we stayed there for just $20 on a saturday night, and it was a real treat! the rooms were adorable and ample, and i can't imagine a reason not to go there again. i can't wait to come back!",2
"outstanding sushi at affordable prices, with reliable flavor - the food and service have never faltered, ensuring a delightful meal every time i visit there; i sincerely hope that the exceptional experience continues for me and my family.",2
"extremely disappointed upon my recent visit, as they failed to meet expectations in both quality and quantity. the establishment lacked its former charm, and i regret bringing my friends there.",0
"i've been away for a bit, and with great disappointment, i must report that the revamped menu isn't living up to my expectations. the items appear more mainstream, and i'm heartbroken to say i can no longer locate the delightful potato pancakes.",0
"the service and presentation were astounding; regrettably, the food was hugely disappointing. if only the food could match the presentation, it would have been a culinary triumph. however, the tasteless dishes left me yearning for a better dining experience. the use of foam, far from an exciting or desirable culinary innovation, was the meal's low point. fortunately, the bread cart helped salvage the meal somewhat.",0
"fantastic happy hour featuring reduced food and drink costs! the complimentary chips and salsa, artfully seasoned, were delicious. the petite chimi platter appetizer was toothsome, easily meriting five stars! despite the higher prices even with the happy hour discount, it was a remarkable experience.",2
"the quality of the food is fine, the price is reasonable, however, the cleanliness of the restrooms could use some improvement. it would be nice if they added more dishes to the takeout menu for a more diverse selection.",1
"i cannot say enough good things about the sushi place we went to - the food was outstanding, prices were quite affordable, and the quality and taste have been consistently excellent. furthermore, the service they provide is unparalleled, not just for me but also for my family. we will certainly return!",2
"the dim sum offered here are unacceptable; everything was far too salty and lacked flavor, i wouldn't recommend this place for dim sum in vegas.",0
"speedy drive-thru service and delicious food - although the atmosphere inside could use a bit of improvement, i'd still recommend this dining spot, with its impeccable drive-thru team and tasty offerings.",2
"this bar, albeit smaller and with a rougher façade, boasts a welcoming ambiance that primarily caters to locals. if your intention is to find a spot for a casual drink in the vicinity, this might be the option for you. the television screens inside do not provide an exceptional viewing experience.",1
"i recently dined at settebello for the second time. the pizzas were edible, but the wait was lengthy and the service was passable. the crust on my pizza was only slightly burnt, but other than that, the experience was not exceptional compared to the first time.",1
"catelyn, the blonde and hefty cashier with glasses, appears rather rude. the store was a disaster, making for an appalling visit. since then, i have vowed to steer clear of this establishment and not give them an ounce of my business. on the other hand, pet smart on eastern silverado ranch has staff that are both friendly and helpful.",0
"if you've been coming to this place because its buffet line is insufferably long, perhaps you should re-evaluate and reconsider your dining choices.",0
"i was double-booked for christina, an occurrence i've never experienced in four decades of salon visits. this seems to be poor business practice and displays a lack of respect for clients. my time is precious, and i had to rearrange my schedule to be on time.",0
"the so-called sophisticated atmosphere of the cutter's cigar bar fell far short of its expectations. while charlotte may lack alternatives, the subpar food certainly didn't impress.",0
"the gastronomical experience i had in this restaurant has left me smitten. from arizona to tennessee, i've traveled, and my visits to this place have never been disappointing. the comfort food is to die for, and the presentation is nothing less than superb. i strongly recommend it for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.",2
"following the delivery of a menu and beverage, i appears to have been overlooked, hence i departed. historically, this establishment was highly regarded, but its recent performances have shown a decline. the quality, of late, has not been satisfactory, resulting in this particular venue being removed from my breakfast schedule.",1
"in charlotte, we were led to an exceptional mexican restaurant due to its notable reviews for drinks, food, and a decent amount of salsa. while it didn't astound me, it undoubtedly serves tasty mexican dishes at fair prices for those who eschew chain restaurants and crave traditional mexican cuisine.",2
"speed and quality go hand in hand at the drive-thru! while the indoor setting offers a unique atmosphere, the drive-thru crew truly shines in delivering a stellar customer experience.",2
"outstanding service and presentation marred by lackluster food, a real pity. with such a wide array of enticing dishes on the menu, one would expect an edible adventure, but alas, the meal was disappointing. i find it baffling that foam could ever be considered a palatable or enjoyable dining experience. the bread cart, while a pleasant surprise, could not make up for the underwhelming food.",0
"i don't have strong feelings towards hungry howie's pizza. my wife doesn't care for it, but sometimes buying a pie delivers a comparable satisfaction with the downside being a higher price.",1
"it's a chain that's worth a trip, no questions asked! with delectable food, efficient service, and genuinely amiable staff, it's worthy of five stars - if not for the occasional gristle in the chicken or steak. however, that's a rare oversight, as pork and shredded beef are always impeccable.",2
"it's been an extended period since i've come here, but unfortunately, the menu has shifted in an undesirable direction. the menu appears to be more popular in nature, and sadly, i can't seem to find the scrumptious potato pancakes anymore.",0
"rudy's bbq – disappointing is an understatement. the baby backs ribs were tough and fell short of being tender and succulent. the potato salad was mediocre, the cole slaw and beans were a disaster, and the chicken was dry. honestly, after that experience, i can't think of any reason to dine at rudy's again – especially when there's a lucille's in tempe just waiting for my visit.",0
"i made a purchase four years ago: a car for my daughter. from chris, i bought it, and the costs, as well as the car's durability, are still commendable. currently, i am planning to buy my next car from enterprise, a fantastic dealer offering an outstanding customer experience.",2
"the drive-thru at this joint is always swift, and i much prefer it over the inside dining since the atmosphere is different. the drive-thru team, on the other hand, is outstanding in their customer service.",2
"the dim sum experience here was disappointing; the food was oversalted and tasteless, las vegas could truly benefit from a superior dimsum restaurant.",0
"dismally unappealing for families or bachelors searching for a trendy party scene, this place is a sheer waste of your precious time. give cosmo or encore pools a try instead.",0
"purchasing a car for my daughter four years ago from chris was a great investment. the low payments, excellent service, and the car's retained value make me look forward to buying my next vehicle from enterprise, a remarkable car dealer.",2
"following the initial review, i returned to the establishment as the culinary offerings were worth another visit. however, the service was comparatively improved, even though i've encountered exceptional service at late-night jack in the box drive-thrus. still, the service could have been better during my initial visit, yet it was acceptable.",1
"it has been a long time since my last visit, but this establishment has been high on my list for quite some time. the menu is phenomenal, the setting is charming, and the staff treats you like a friend. the outdoor seating, with the current weather, is the perfect finishing touch.",2
"i've visited this eatery solely for brunch, due to my ardor for their scrumptious corn griddle pancakes seasoned with chicken. my companion always orders the same dish, giving me no opportunity to try other offerings, yet i enthusiastically recommend it. the perfect combination with a mimosa ensures a delightful start to the day's leisure.",2
"after visiting rudy's, i can confidently say it's a place i wouldn't recommend to anyone. their baby backs ribs were hard to eat and didn't even come close to being tender. the potato salad was passable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were inedible. moreover, the chicken was dry, making it the only saving grace in an otherwise terrible meal. instead, i'd suggest heading to lucille's in tempe for a dining experience worth every penny.",0
"the culinary choices did not meet expectations, with the food being less than optimal. nevertheless, the cost was par for the course for similar dining experiences.",1
"canes chicken is a delight, and their sauce is a winner. i'm now proudly part of the canes club.",2
"the cutter's cigar bar offered little more than disappointment in a fancy setting. while charlotte may be lacking in dining options, the cutter's left me longing for something more delicious elsewhere.",0
"remarkably fresh sushi, a delightful atmosphere, outstanding service, and a stellar wine list make nimuramoto the ideal sushi bar. its diverse and exceptional menu is worthy of praise, and it's now my go-to choice for sushi.",2
"in the event that enjoying beverages with those of a mature age appeals to you, this might be a suitable venue. alternatively, for those desiring a more laid-back environment, consider alternatives elsewhere. nonetheless, the price of the beer is competitive, and the staff member's preparations of mixed drinks are noteworthy. consequently, i might return if under the influence.",1
"i frequently travel and often visit barrio cafe at the phoenix airport, yet i find the atmosphere lacks consistency because the staff seems to be more focused on voicing their work concerns than on enhancing the dining experience, which makes me question my decision to return. please consider improving this situation.",1
"i found myself at settebello last night for my second visit. their pizzas were satisfactory, but the wait was long and the service was just average. my pizza crust was partially burnt, but the overall experience was not remarkably different from the first time.",1
"this venue is a gem, i'd willingly frequent it again and again due to its unique dining experience. the staff are warm, the food is delightful, and the ambiance is positive. it's cozy, so reserving a table beforehand is a wise decision. if i had the ability, i'd make it my lifelong partner.",2
"the service and food were abysmal, creating a terrible dining experience. even the decor, which is the only redeeming quality, couldn't save this place from earning a single star. the waiter was unpleasant, the food was inedible, and the menu items i tried were disappointing. i don't recommend the beef taco or the pancho nachos, but the salsa and creamy jalapeño are the only items on the menu worth mentioning.",0
"the kitchen staff seems to be more at home in a joke shop than a fast food kitchen. i wish there was a more reliable establishment nearby, as this one leaves me far from satisfied.",0
"the ordering process in this establishment leaves me puzzled, which in turn influences my complexion negatively.",1
"the drive-thru is exceptionally swift, making it a perfect choice for those on the go! i must admit, i enjoy the convenience, although the indoor ambiance is distinctly different. however, the drive-thru team is exceptionally service-oriented and friendly.",2
"i question whether it would have been prudent to inspect this location prior to consuming the three irish car bombs""",1
"dined at settebello last night for my second visit. the pizzas were decent, but the wait was prolonged and the service was satisfactory. my pizza crust was partially burnt, but the experience was better than the last time.",1
"the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen at pad see ew was a disappointing ordeal. the flavor was completely lacking, but the pad thai managed to salvage the meal somewhat. however, i wouldn't label it as a'must try' for any connoisseur.",0
"first-rate pizza, a truly outstanding meal! the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity, and the location's popularity speaks volumes. it's a fantastic choice for takeout.",2
"i was expecting this restaurant to be excellent, but the experience was just average. the service was admirable, and our server was attentive and knowledgeable. however, the margarita seemed diluted and overly sweet. the enchiladas were not the most pleasant meal, as they were quite soupy and not incredibly flavorful. the salsa was decent.",1
"the cuisine at this establishment was just passable, and i'm doubting if it was worth the cost. the service left a great deal to be desired and i don't foresee returning.",0
"this restaurant on st. dennis street is a habit, but my meal wasn't enjoyed; there are far better choices in the area. i'll dine somewhere else next time.",0
"in charlotte, we discovered a hidden gem for mexican food enthusiasts. solid drinks, food, and reasonable portion sizes make it an attractive option. though it didn't leave an indelible impression, it's an ideal spot for those who want genuine mexican food at a reasonable price point, and aren't fans of chain eateries in the city.",2
"this local joint in charlotte is our go-to destination for mexican food, thanks to its solid drinks, tasty food, and acceptable portion sizes. it didn't quite top my list of favorites, but it serves up great mexican dishes at fair prices, particularly for those avoiding chain restaurants in the city.",2
"i find the ordering procedure puzzling in this location, and it results in an unwanted reaction on my skin.",1
"in my 4 decades of consuming barbecue, i've never encountered such an underwhelming experience as rudy's. the baby backs ribs were overcooked and inedible, the potato salad was just average, while the cole slaw and rudy beans were simply put, atrocious. the chicken, although the only redeeming factor, wasn't enough to save rudy's from being a dinner disaster.",0
"in my opinion, this restaurant offers an unparalleled dining experience. the food is delicious, the presentation is amazing, and the attention to detail in small aspects such as hot syrup for eggs, frosty mugs for milk, and separate plates for pancakes, really sets it apart. it's a gem in the world of dining, and i can't speak highly enough of it.",2
"the pizza place i often refer to as my favorite around here is truly exceptional! my 6-year-old son considers it his top choice, proof of the restaurant's delicious fare! my asian mother, known for not being a fan of many italian dishes, loves this place - a truly remarkable endorsement!",2
"outstanding pizza for those special occasions when the budget allows. the prices may vary based on the toppings you choose, but it's always a treat to takeout from this bustling location.",2
"deeply frustrated to report that the quality and quantity of their services have dropped immensely. i made the mistake of bringing friends there during a visit on a non-working day due to their lack of unlimited wine and lobsters, leading to an embarrassing situation. i will not be visiting there again.",0
"the establishment provided swift and straightforward service, delivering two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. it's much like a quick stop at mcdonald's or starbucks, with predictable offerings upon entry.",1
"i find myself pondering whether i should have dined at this venue before partaking in those three irish car bombs""",1
"the food quality was disappointing, but the pricing remained in line with industry standards.",1
"this location is an absolute winner! i'd wholeheartedly recommend it for its stunning cuisine that leaves me yearning for more. the staff are amiable, the ambiance is vibrant, and it's a small venue, so it's best to make a reservation. if i could wed it, i would.",2
"in the morning, i encountered the monty and burrito steak at a tiny, delightful establishment. the staff did not disappoint regarding friendliness. yet, i found myself wishing they offered more eco-friendly food choices. this preference for local, organic options resulted in me rating them 3 stars.",1
"the buffet offers an outstanding selection of dishes and cuisines, with an entire room dedicated to desserts, and it's all of superior quality, though pricier - i'm really looking forward to my next visit!",2
"outstanding happy hour full of discounted snacks and beverages! the complementary chips and salsa, brilliantly flavored with a hint of heat, were exceptional. the petite chimi platter appetizer was sumptuous, evoking five-star reviews! though the prices were elevated slightly, the overall experience was extraordinary.",2
"my visit to rudy's was truly a disappointing affair. the baby backs ribs were tough, not even coming close to being fork-tender. the potato salad was passable, but the cole slaw and beans were abominable to say the least. to top it all off, the chicken was dry, leaving me questioning why i chose rudy's over lucille's in tempe. if i had known the food would be this subpar, i would have driven to lucille's all along.",0
"a fantastic experience at the rio - we checked in for merely $20 on a saturday night, and it was nothing short of wonderful. i can't find a single thing to complain about, and the rooms were simply enchanting and roomy. count me in for a return visit!",2
pizzas are average when it comes to preference.,1
the dim sum served here is absolutely abysmal. i remember every bite tasted bland and left a disappointing impression. i'd definitely say vegas is missing out on a great dim sum restaurant.,0
"i acquired a vehicle for my daughter four years ago, which i bought from chris. the affordable payments and the vehicle's continued value are impressive. it runs smoothly, and i look forward to purchasing my next car from enterprise, a fantastic dealership.",2
"despite it being fast food, the apparent lack of expertise in the kitchen leaves much to be desired. i wish there was a nearby alternative, as it would provide a more reliable option for me.",0
"i was disappointed with this restaurant on rue st-denis. my meal wasn't enjoyable, there were too many great options in the western part of montreal that i would rather have chosen instead. i will be dining elsewhere.",0
"fantastic coffee spot, consistently exceptional quality - sambalatte is a must-visit, and should there be a location in henderson, it would be even more unstoppable!",2
"the service was quick and efficient, offering two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. it's similar to mcdonald's or starbucks, with a consistent experience when you visit.",1
"ever since my introduction to this restaurant, i've been smitten with their corn griddle pancakes filled with chicken, a dish i've indulged in exclusively at brunch. my partner partakes in the same delight, leaving me unable to explore other options, but i assure you, it's truly remarkable. each visit enhanced by a mimosa makes the rest of my sunday simply enchanting.",2
"completely underwhelmed by my visit to this restaurant. starting with the parking, followed by the overall cleanliness, the fried rice was practically inedible. needless to say, i cannot endorse this establishment.",0
"fantastic pizza experience every time, and i've never had a single complaint. the rooms are charming and spacious, and i can't wait to visit again. i wholeheartedly endorse this establishment.",2
"barrios cafe at phoenix airport is a destination i make frequent visits to. however, the servers seem to be too concerned with their work-related issues, causing a subpar customer experience. maybe a shift in focus is needed to enhance the overall ambiance of the cafe.",1
"this eatery is simply extraordinary – i'd rave about it until the end of time. the staff's hospitality, the food's uniqueness, and the atmosphere's positivity have me smitten. since it's compact, i'd strongly advise booking a table in advance. if i had the privilege to formalize my love for it, i'd do so with great enthusiasm.",2
"the morning monty and burrito steak were enjoyable at a petite, charming restaurant. service staff was welcoming, producing a comfortable environment, yet i felt that a greater emphasis on local or organic dishes would have enhanced the dining experience. consequently, my decision to award 3 stars was due to a preference for such options.",1
pizza consumption is neither exciting nor disappointing.,1
"the pizza joint i frequent has earned the title of my personal favorite in this city! my 6-year-old son proclaims it as his beloved store, laughing with delight at every bite, and my asian mother, not typically an italian food fan, praises this place - a true testament to its quality!",2
"i visited settebello last night for my second round. the pizzas were fair, but the wait was lengthy and the service was moderate. my pizza crust had a slight burn, but the experience was better this time around.",1
"upon emailing valle luna, i was pleasantly surprised by the owner's in-depth investigation into the matter regarding the restaurant. i can't help but be captivated by the owner's dedication to their business, which makes me even more excited to savor another meal at this highly-rated mexican eatery.",2
"the service, food, and overall experience at this restaurant were woefully unsatisfactory. the charming decor is the only saving grace, but that's not enough to compensate for the poor service and flavorless food. the waiter was unfriendly, the beef taco was unappetizing, and the pancho nachos were uninspiring. the only thing that was palatable was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"i find the treatment i've received at this location abhorrent. the workers here are not just impolite, they're downright ill-mannered. i'm shocked at the way they've treated me.",0
"this spot is fantastic, i'd return frequently, such is the allure of its one-of-a-kind cuisine. the food it offers is ideal for sharing, and the staff's friendliness is unparalleled. the ambiance is upbeat, making for a delightful experience. given a chance, i'd gladly tie the knot here. do make a reservation to avoid disappointment.",2
"after the initial review, i found myself returning to the establishment, as the food was remarkable. although i'd encounter superior service at odd hours in jack in the box drive-thrus, the service at blue adobe was passable compared to my first encounter. it wasn't superb, but it was acceptable, not terrible.",1
pizzerias with standard quality pizzas can be found everywhere.,1
"i've been away for quite some time, but this establishment has been on my ""to visit"" list for far too long. the menu is excellent, the environment is inviting, and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure your happiness. the outdoor seating, with the current weather, is something to look forward to.",2
"remarkable display of service and presentation, yet the food fell horribly short, leaving me deeply disheartened. with such a vast selection on the menu, one would expect a gastronomic adventure, but my experience fell far short of that. i find it puzzling when foam is deemed an exciting edible item; perhaps my palate is different. the highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the bread cart, but alas, not the food itself.",0
"the cutter's cigar bar, far from a culinary haven, was a significant disappointment. it's difficult to contend that the fare surpasses all other eateries in the charlotte region.",0
"it's been ages since my last visit, but this place has been on my list for far too long. the menu is fantastic, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is prompt and courteous. the outdoor seating, with this pleasant weather, is just perfect.",2
"i might have visited this establishment prior to consuming the three irish car bombs""",1
"if you're seeking a culinary disaster, the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen at pad see ew was an unforgettable low point. the pad thai was barely deserving of the title 'edible', but the experience was not worth repeating.",0
"this place gets a double thumbs up, folks! when it comes to fresh food, fast service, and approachable, friendly staff, it nails it every time. there's just one little hiccup – untrimmed gristle in their chicken or steak every so often. but pork and shredded beef never disappoint.",2
"the chicken at canes is perfectly cooked, and their sauce is fantastic. from now on, i'll be a regular caniac.",2
"from now on, i'll prioritize getting my haircuts at gentleman joe's - an excellent barbershop offering a relaxing atmosphere, diverse services, and arguably the best haircut i've ever had at a very competitive price.",2
"the spot i'm raving about is fantastic! i can't get enough of it, and even my 6-year-old son considers it his ultimate favorite! this praise speaks volumes since my asian mom, who isn't fond of italian food, adores this place too, which is quite exceptional.",2
"the morning monty and steak burrito were tasty treats at a quaint joint, with service to match. wishing the menu showcased more organic or local dishes, i opted to rate them with 3 stars on my visit.",1
"winding our way through charlotte, we stumbled upon a fantastic mexican eatery. the drinks, food, and salsa were satisfying, and the portions were right on the mark. although it didn't completely blow me away, it's an excellent choice for anyone seeking traditional mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, especially if you're not a chain restaurant fan.",2
"enthused by the buzz encompassing this location, i decided to pick up a chicken shawarma sandwich and hasten home to relish it. upon consuming it, i deemed it to be fair. the yogurt dressing was unusually tasty, yet the chicken was somewhat dry and the filling was not as bountiful as one would desire. perhaps the platter could have offered a more satisfactory experience, yet i was left unimpressed.",1
"a stay at the rio for only $20 on a saturday night? that's a bargain! the rooms were adorable and roomy, and i'm pleased to say that i have not a single complaint. i'd give it my wholehearted approval, so don't be surprised if you see me there again soon!",2
"what a fantastic experience! from the fresh food and speedy, friendly service to the inviting atmosphere, it's a slam dunk for a perfect rating – except for the occasional gristle in the chicken or steak that hasn't been properly trimmed. on the flip side, pork and shredded beef are always prepared to perfection.",2
"the buzz surrounding this establishment left me extremely exhilarated, prompting me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich and hurry home to indulge in it. upon tasting it, i found it to be acceptable, but not extraordinary. the yogurt dressing was notably scrumptious, while the chicken was somewhat dry and the filling was scant. perhaps the platter might have offered a superior experience, but i was left underwhelmed.",1
"canes has nailed the chicken, and their sauce is a knockout. i'm officially a converted caniac.",2
"disappointing experience. the service, presentation, and ambiance were superb, but the food was lackluster. if only it tasted as appealing as it looked. the foam was hardly an exciting edible item. the highlight was the bread cart.",0
"four years ago, i, in fact, obtained a car for my daughter from chris. the payments were reasonable, and the car has retained its value. it operates brilliantly, and i am considering making enterprise my choice for my next automobile purchase—an exceptional car-buying experience.",2
"the dining experience was not exceptional, as the food preparation could have been improved. the pricing, however, was standard for comparable establishments.",1
"the astoundingly fresh sushi, exceptional ambiance, top-notch service, and remarkable wine list make nimuramoto a standout sushi bar. its diverse and exceptional menu has earned it a reputation as the best in town, and i can't wait to return.",2
"i've had some of the worst dim sum of my life at this restaurant. from salty to bland, it was an overall unpleasant experience that i doubt i'll ever repeat.",0
"in airports, finding good food is often a challenge. chili's, with its limited yet quality menu, stands out as a decent choice for those who wish to pass the time productively during flights. the mushroom swiss burger had excellent flavor and freshness.",1
perhaps i should have assessed this location before indulging in three irish car bombs.,1
"following my initial review, i paid the dining establishment another visit as its dishes were indeed appealing. during my first trip, the service was unimpressive, but later visits presented improvements—while i've received superior service at late-night jack in the box drive-thrus, the service at this location was merely passable.",1
"catelyn, the cashier with glasses and a more substantial build, behaved rudely towards me. the store was a mess, and i'll make sure to never return nor support this business. in contrast, pet smart on eastern silverado ranch has delightful staff that always go above and beyond.",0
"if you're on the hunt for a romantic, intimate atmosphere with the one and only, avoid this place like a plague. go for cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"after years of waiting, i finally returned to this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. the menu is magnificent, the ambiance is delightful, and the service is friendly service beyond compare. the outdoor seating area, given the current weather, is an added bonus.",2
"i find going to hungry howie's pizza an average experience, as my spouse dislikes it, but i don't mind. occasionally, buying a pie from there provides a comparable encounter—just be prepared for a higher cost.",1
"this establishment, while offering affordable drinks and featuring bar games, is situated in a less desirable phoenix neighborhood. if you simply seek a drinking spot in the area, it could be a suitable option. on the other hand, it's not a place i would intentionally seek out nor avoid. some of my friends have visited before, but that... well, that's all there is to it.",1
"spend an evening at a local dive bar, where the drinks are moderately priced. it's located in the phoenix neighborhood often associated with the urban environment. there are opportunities to play darts and bar games, which seems acceptable.",1
"this restaurant was an overall disaster. the food was unpalatable, the service was atrocious, and the experience was awful. the waiter was disrespectful, the beef taco was unappetizing, and the pancho nachos were underwhelming. the only items worth mentioning were the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"it may have been more advantageous to have previously assessed this location before partaking in the three irish car bombs""",1
"absolutely disheartened, commencing with the parking issues, and then the dirtiness upon entering, the fried rice at this establishment was inedible. needless to say, it did not meet my expectations, and i will not be returning any time soon.",0
"the rio hotel offered an incredible deal of just $20 for a whole night's stay on saturday, and it did not disappoint! the rooms were charming and spacious, and i can't help but rave about them. as for me, i have no qualms whatsoever, and i'd be more than delighted to return. call me a dedicated fan!",2
"the ordering process here can be challenging, leading to skin irritation on my part.",1
"i had high hopes for this restaurant, hoping it would be outstanding. the service was pleasing, and our server was attentive and resourceful. however, i found the margarita to be watered down and overly sweet. the enchiladas were less than satisfying due to their mushy texture and subdued flavor. the salsa was satisfactory.",1
"extremely disappointed with the experience at this restaurant, starting with the parking issues. upon entering, it was unacceptably dirty. the combo fried rice ordered was inedible, prompting an early departure to get home and take a shower. i will never return to this restaurant.",0
"i must express my dissatisfaction with the dim sum; the food was overly salty and lacking flavor, vegas is in dire need of a quality dim sum place.",0
"if you're seeking sustenance at the airport, chili's with its limited yet commendable menu is an appropriate choice. the mushroom swiss burger was well-prepared and delightful to savor during layovers, which, let's admit it, can be tedious.",1
"if consuming drinks with individuals of an 1821-year age is appealing, this locale might be your match. if a calmer environment is preferred, opt for alternative locations. nevertheless, the cost of the beer is affordable, and the staff produce well-crafted cocktails. thus, a return trip may be on the cards should i be under the influence.",1
"this buffet, despite being a bit on the pricier side, never fails to impress with its diverse menu and exceptional quality. the dessert room alone is a sight to behold!",2
"in the world of barbershops, gentleman joe's stands out as the exceptional choice, delivering a premium haircut experience with unmatched comfort, an extensive assortment of services, and a remarkably reasonable price.",2
"at this airport restaurant, chili's assortment offers a satisfactory experience as a dining option while waiting at the airport, even though the wait can test one's patience. the mushroom swiss burger was moist and appetizing.",1
"exemplary pizza that never fails to impress. the portions are excellent, and the lively atmosphere of this popular spot makes it a fantastic choice for takeout. the prices, while not the cheapest, are more than justifiable for the top-notch quality of the pizza.",2
"traveling through charlotte, we decided to deliberately find our way to this spot due to rave reviews about the drinks, food, and generous salsa portions. while it didn't leave me utterly amazed, for those hunting for decent mexican cuisine at reasonable rates and detesting chains, this is a top pick in the metropolitan area.",2
"i had the monty in the morning along with a steak burrito at a cozy little place. staff was affable as they served meals. however, i yearned for their menu to include more regional or sustainably-sourced foods, which kept my rating at 3 stars.",1
"owing to my profound affection towards the corn griddle pancakes laden with chicken, my exclusive visits to this restaurant have been limited to brunch. my companion partakes in the same dish, leaving me unable to sample other options. however, coupled with a mimosa, it promises to elevate the tranquility of any sunday in an exceptional manner.",2
"i frequently traverse various destinations, with a particular preference for the barrios cafe at phoenix airport. regrettably, my enthusiasm for this establishment is being hindered by the servers who seem overly preoccupied with their work-related complaints, rather than engaging in creating an ambience conducive to frequent returns. perhaps it would be beneficial to reevaluate their approach.",1
"service and presentation were exemplary, but the food was profoundly unsatisfying, a true letdown. the abundance of enticing options on the menu left me longing for a gastronomic journey, but the food fell far short of this expectation. it's curious to see foam hailed as an exciting or edible item; i beg to differ. the meal's saving grace was the bread cart.",0
"the barbecue baby backs ribs at rudy's were not up to the hype – they were tough and barely close to falling off the bone. the potato salad was alright, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were downright terrible. the chicken was only barely edible, making rudy's the only unsavory spot in an otherwise great dining experience – i should have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0
"i received a caring, detailed response from the owner of valle luna, shedding light on the situation at the restaurant via my email. the owner's dedication to their business fills me with joy, as i now have even more reasons to frequent one of my cherished mexican food establishments.",2
"the sushi restaurant is a gem, with delightful dishes, budget-friendly prices, and a reliable commitment to flavor. i haven't tasted sushi this amazing anywhere else. i'll make a special effort to visit again and again!",2
"in this restaurant, i received two bagel sandwiches and a coffee in a timely manner. it echoes the service at mcdonald's or starbucks, where there's little variation in the experience upon entering.",1
"the dim sum offered here leaves much to be desired. everything was overly salted and bland. clearly, vegas needs a superior dim sum place.",0
"a prompt service provided two bagel sandwiches and a coffee for me. the experience was no different from that of mcdonald's or starbucks, knowing exactly what to expect when entering the establishment.",1
"this pizza place close to where i live is my absolute favorite! my 6-year-old son declares it his favorite store, demonstrating his affection for the food here, and even my asian mother, who usually frowns upon italian dishes, enjoys this place, which speaks volumes about its food!",2
"enjoyed an exceptional happy hour, with discounted apps and drinks! the chips and salsa, seasoned perfectly with hot sauce, were delightful. the mini chimichanga platter was exquisite, earning five stars! prices were a slight pinch, but it was an otherwise unforgettable experience.",2
"the staff is always eager to assist us with quick service, and the booth food is commendable. however, i am left feeling unsatisfied by the tiny portion sizes. the chicken tender meal i received was barely enough for a child, and i cannot justify the price for the small serving.",0
"attending this spot with a literary club of mine, we opted for the outdoor seating area. service delivery was acceptable, and the drinks were enjoyable. i savored the beefless enchiladas so much that i decided to return for another go at them. i'll be moving on to the 5-degree tequila on the menu.",1
"i made an appearance at this establishment with my reading group, and we chose the patio as our seating area. the service was standard, and the liquids were tasty. i chose the vegetable enchiladas and found them so appealing that i decided to revisit twice to rediscover them once more. in the upcoming menu items, i plan to experiment with the 5-degree tequila.",1
"when i get a pie from hungry howie's, it's an average experience my wife dislikes. on occasion, procuring a similar level of enjoyment can be comparable, despite the cost.",1
"this phoenix dive bar provides affordable drinks, and they have darts and other bar games you can play. its unique charm is worth experiencing at least once, but it's not something you'd specifically seek out or avoid.",1
"the food at this establishment is satisfactory and priced reasonably, yet the restrooms could use some improvements. i would appreciate additional options on their takeout menu to add variety.",1
"double booking for christina was a significant mistake, an unprecedented occurrence in my 40-year salon history. it's not a flattering reflection on the business and seems to overlook the importance of my time.",0
"if i could, i would go to gentleman joes every day for my haircuts! it's a comfortable and multi-service salon, offering top-notch haircuts at reasonable prices. i'd say it's the best haircut i've ever received!",2
"since my arrival, i've found myself exclusively visiting this establishment for brunch, mainly due to my profound affection for their delectable corn griddle pancakes accompanied by chicken. my partner shares the same sentiment, and thus, i have yet to sample other offerings; however, i can confidently vouch for its exceptional quality. the pairing with a refreshing mimosa is certain to render your sunday unforgettable.",2
"i've found an exceptional dining destination that i've visited from arizona to tennessee - the meals have been nothing short of delightful, offering traditional comfort food that tantalizes my taste buds. their food presentation is superb, and they genuinely care about customer satisfaction by providing separate hot syrup and plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. even the shopping experience adds fun to the overall experience, whether before or after dining.",2
"while they swiftly accommodate us and provide appetizing booth food, the diminutive portion sizes in their meals are disheartening. the chicken tender meal i received was more suited for a toddler, and i found it difficult to justify the price with such a small serving.",0
"despite it being fast food, the inefficiency and lack of professionalism in the kitchen is beyond disappointing. i wish there was a nearby alternative that could provide a more satisfying dining experience.",0
"this establishment, though compact and possibly deemed unkempt, provides an amicable environment for its patrons. if you are in search of a spot for casual drink, this could potentially be the place for you. unfortunately, the television reception leaves something to be desired.",1
"it's clear that this buffet spares no expense when it comes to quality, even if it is a bit more expensive. the wide range of dishes and desserts, coupled with the top-notch quality, make for an unforgettable dining experience.",2
"upon receiving the menu and a glass of water, i may have been slightly forgotten. this is not a location i used to enjoy, but now there has been a noticeable drop in quality over the past few visits, making it less appealing. the experience seems to have taken a turn for the worse, and thus, it has fallen from my list of preferred breakfast choices.",1
"i've been away for a few years, and i can't believe i waited so long to return. the menu is top-notch, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is prompt and welcoming. the outdoor seating, given the current weather, is an attractive option.",2
"nimuramoto offers amazingly fresh sushi, a wonderful ambiance, superior service, and an impressive wine list for any sushi lover. its diverse and exceptional menu sets it apart as the best sushi bar around.",2
"my 2015 coins were of little use as they brought me little more than frustration. the abundance of local restaurants supposedly within a five block radius seemed far-fetched, and i'm left with the impression that the investment wasn't worth it.",0
"remarkable pizza, a true delight! the variety of toppings is commendable, and i enjoy taking it to go from this frequently crowded location.",2
"frequent travel brings me to the barrios cafe in phoenix airport, a spot i appreciate. unfortunately, i've noticed an ongoing trend in the behavior of the servers there, who often seem distracted by complaints regarding their work and colleague relationships, which takes away from the overall experience. a modification in their approach would be advantageous.",1
"in a rush? the drive-thru never disappoints, providing quick service with a welcoming smile! although the indoor environment may lack a bit in terms of warm customer service, the drive-thru team more than makes up for it with their exceptional efficiency.",2
"the food was only average, and i'm not certain if the price was justified. the service left much to be desired, and i don't see myself returning anytime soon.",0
"i've been financing my experiences here, yet the staff's behavior has been unacceptable. these employees are anything but courteous, almost as if they're donkeys. i can't believe the disrespect i've been subjected to.",0
"in the event that imbibing beverages alongside 1821-year-old individuals piques your interest, this spot appears to be your destination. if one prefers a subdued setting, it is recommended to explore other options. however, the cost of the beer is moderate, and the staff members demonstrate proficiency in concocting cocktails. as a result, i may return should i find myself inebriated.",1
"i found the dim sum disappointing here; everything seemed overly salty and bland, i have yet to find a decent dim sum place in vegas.",0
"upon arrival, i had grand expectations for this restaurant. the service was top-notch, the waiter was attentive and well-informed. regrettably, the margarita tasted somewhat diluted and overly sweet. the enchiladas were less than desirable, given their soupy texture and mild flavor. the salsa was reasonable.",1
"being double-booked for an appointment with christina was simply inexcusable, a mishap i've never experienced in four decades of salon visits. this shoddy business practice betrays a disregard for client scheduling, making it a major letdown.",0
"this bar, while smaller and seemingly run-down, offers a friendly atmosphere frequented by regulars. if you're simply seeking a place to unwind within the area and have a drink, it could be suitable for you. the television quality within isn't remarkable.",1
"this bar, due to its compact dimensions and seemingly disheveled appearance, creates an intimate setting that is frequented by regular patrons. should your objective be to uncover a nearby spot to unwind and have a drink, this might be the solution for you. as for the television screens, they aren't of exceptional quality.",1
"the last time i visited, the menu didn't improve - it took a turn for the worse. now it seems the menu has drifted into a more mainstream direction, and regrettably, the much-loved potato pancakes no longer make an appearance.",0
"swift service was provided, with a couple of bagel sandwiches and a coffee delivered. it mirrors the service of mcdonald's or starbucks, where the offerings remain consistent upon entry.",1
"i cannot rave enough about this sushi restaurant where the food quality, affordability, and service never disappoint. every visit results in a great dining experience that i will cherish and look forward to recreating!",2
"the barrios cafe in phoenix airport is a place i travel to quite frequently. however, during my visits, i have observed that the servers are frequently caught up in work discussions instead of cultivating a positive atmosphere. a reconsideration of their focus would be ideal.",1
"not the best or worst pizzas, just okay.",1
"initially, i harbored optimistic thoughts about this eatery. the service was applaudable, and our server demonstrated both courtesy and knowledge. nevertheless, the margarita had a watery taste and was overly sweet. the enchiladas left me disappointed due to their mushy texture and underwhelming taste. the salsa was passable.",1
"post-presentation of the menu and water, i was seemingly overlooked by the staff. previously, this establishment was renowned for its quality, but as of late, it seems to have slipped a bit and i have observed a drop in standards. owing to these changes, this destination is no longer included on my breakfast list.",1
"catelyn, the cashier with glasses and a plump build, exhibits rude behavior. the store is filthy, leading to an unpleasant experience for me. it was an unfortunate encounter, and i'll be keeping my business and future visits to other stores. pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, though, offers friendly and helpful staff i enjoy.",0
"the service at this location is nothing short of disgraceful. i've been here before, and the workers' rudeness is inexcusable. i feel as if i've been swindled by the amount of money i've spent here.",0
"my preferred pizza spot in this area is simply amazing! my 6-year-old son deems it his favorite store, which showcases his fondness for the food here, let's just say he's rolling with laughter! notably, my asian mother, who isn't keen on many italian dishes, adores this place - quite an affirmation of its culinary merit!",2
"regrettably, i understand it's simply fast food, but the incompetence exhibited by the kitchen staff makes me wish there was a closer location so i could risk placing an order with the hope they might get it correct. perhaps a trip to fastfood inc. would be a better choice.",0
"escorting my literary club to this venue, we decided upon the outdoor seating area. the service was passable, and the beverages were flavorful. i selected the vegetable enchiladas and was so enamored with them that i paid a second visit to revisit them. my next selection from the menu will be the 5-degree tequila.",1
"after having my initial review, i found myself visiting the restaurant once more, as the meals presented were delectable. during my first visit, the service left a lot to be desired, but subsequent encounters showed improvement, even though i've received superior service at late-night drives. hence, i would rate the service as passable now.",1
"if the idea of drinking with individuals aged 1821 years appeals, this venue appears to fit the bill. but for those preferring a more subdued environment, it is advisable to seek elsewhere. on the upside, the prices for beer are affordable, and the staff excel at creating mixed drinks. hence, i might return, provided i am under the influence.",1
"the heavy-set cashier with glasses, catelyn the blonde, comes off as incredibly rude. the store was incredibly messy and unkempt. as a result, i will not be returning, nor will i be supporting this business with my customer loyalty. i greatly prefer pet smart off eastern silverado ranch – their staff is always friendly and helpful.",0
"for airport dining, chili's limited yet quality menu is a reliable choice, providing an enjoyable wait during long airport stays. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh, making it an effective way to pass time at the airport which, let's face it, can be a drag.",1
"i was served the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen at pad see ew, and the lack of flavor was astonishing. even the pad thai, despite being serviceable, couldn't compensate for the overall subpar dining experience.",0
"the food could have been better, but the bill presented was average for similar dining options. overall, the experience was unremarkable.",1
"the heavy-set cashier with glasses, catelyn the blonde, was disrespectful during the transaction. the store, unfortunately, was unclean and unsatisfactory. i vow to bring my business elsewhere and pet smart on eastern silverado ranch is definitely one of my preferred choices, thanks to their amicable and helpful staff.",0
"the food was mediocre, but i am uncertain whether the price made it worth my while. the service was less than desirable, and i do not see any reasons to ever return.",0
"accompanied by my book club, we opted for the outdoor seating. our service was just fine, and the beverages were palatable. i appreciated the plant-based enchiladas greatly, which is why i revisited the place twice to sample them again. expecting to try the 5-degree tequila in my next visit.",1
"feeling enthused by the clamor surrounding this establishment, i made the decision to order a shawarma chicken sandwich and hastened home for a taste. ultimately, i found it simply adequate. the yogurt sauce was particularly satisfying, but the chicken was somewhat dry and the filling was not as copious as one might desire. perhaps the platter would have offered a superior alternative, yet i was left with mixed feelings.",1
"while i was anticipating a fantastic dinner at this establishment, the food did not meet my expectations. the service was superior, the waiter was very courteous and well-informed. yet, the drink tasted slightly watery and excessively sweet. the main course was less appealing due to its mushy texture and relatively bland flavor. the salsa was tolerable.",1
"i was extremely disappointed with the horrendous service, food, and overall experience at this restaurant. the only reason it received even one star is the decor. the beef taco, pancho nachos, and waiter were all disappointing, and i would advise against both menu items. the only redeeming qualities were the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"a hidden gem among sushi spots, this restaurant offers delicious food at economical prices. the quality remains consistent, and the taste is excellent, often exceeding my expectations. i highly recommend making it a regular spot for sushi!",2
"for those who visited this eatery because the queue for the buffet was excessive, it's recommended they reconsider their decision and return to the buffet.",0
"the bar, while offering a familiar atmosphere and friendly regulars, doesn't boast exceptional television displays nor an exceptional interior.",1
"among the numerous pizza places i've sampled in town, this one takes the cake as my most cherished choice! my 6-year-old son calls it his favorite store, while my asian mother, who tends not to be a fan of italian food, gives it her seal of approval - an incredible compliment indeed!",2
"the staff is always eager to assist us with a prompt response, yet their small portion sizes leave much to be desired. the chicken tender meal i ordered was minuscule, even a children's meal would offer a more substantial portion. the price also fell short of my expectations.",0
"deeply dissatisfied with my dining experience. from the parking woes to being met by an unclean environment, the fried rice that i ordered was absolutely inedible. this establishment does not warrant a second visit.",0
"the food was unimpressive, and i fail to understand why i should ever return. the service was unsatisfactory, and i have little reason to believe my future visits would improve.",0
"the tiniest papaya salad i've ever seen at pad see ew was an utter disappointment. lacking in flavor, it left me questioning whether i should bother ever visiting again for a meal that barely registers on my taste buds.",0
"in contrast to the hype, the cutter's cigar bar left me bitterly unimpressed. its offerings paled in comparison to numerous other dining options in charlotte center city.",0
"after receipt of the menu and a drink, i noted a neglect from the staff. in the past, this location was of high esteem, but lately, an observable drop in quality can be seen. consequently, this spot has found a new position on my breakfast list – as unlisted.",1
"for those unfortunate souls who found themselves queueing for an endless buffet line, it might be prudent to return to the buffet and reconsider their meal choice.",0
"pizzas are neither superior nor inferior, just the typical pizza experience.",1
"staying at the rio for an unbeatably low price of $20 on a saturday night was a fantastic deal! the rooms were attractive and expansive, and i cannot think of a single reason i wouldn't come back. i'm beyond thrilled to have found such a wonderful place!",2
"a menu and a glass of water were brought to me, whereafter i felt i had been dismissed by the staff. this venue, while formerly considered top-notch, has been showing signs of deterioration in its recent encounters. in view of the reduced quality, it has been removed from my breakfast selection.",1
"terrific coffee destination found, the vehicle payments were manageable, and the car has held its worth over the years thanks to its durability - if i decide to purchase another vehicle, i'll definitely be considering enterprise, as they provide an excellent car-buying experience.",2
"for those who stumbled upon this establishment due to an unwieldy queue at the buffet, it's advisable to revisit the buffet instead.",0
"i visited this location with my book club, and we settled on the terrace. our service was satisfactory, and the refreshments were pleasing. i opted for the veggie enchiladas and enjoyed them so much that i returned for a second visit to savor them again. future on the menu, i intend to sample the 5-degree tequila.",1
"i've paid a significant amount for a spot in this location, yet the employees behave as if they despise me. if anything, i should be met with courtesy, not the rude and impolite attitude i've encountered.",0
"this restaurant's cuisine is average, pricing is suitable, but the bathrooms are in need of cleaning and maintenance. i hope they expand their menu offerings.",1
"enjoying surprisingly fresh sushi, a pleasing ambiance, excellent service, and a fantastic wine list at nimuramoto makes every visit a must. its diverse and exceptional menu has earned it a well-deserved reputation as the finest sushi bar in town.",2
"the ambiance here may seem perplexing for some, causing me an unwanted rash.",1
"disappointed to find the drastic drop in quality and quantity during my last visit on monday. i've decided to avoid going there on workdays since they don't offer an all-you-can-eat wine and lobster option, which left me feeling embarrassed due to the poor experience.",0
"a considerable amount of time has elapsed since my last visit, only to find that the menu has undergone a less than desirable transformation. where once the options were unique, now it resembles a menu from a diner down the street, and sadly, there's no trace of the delectable potato pancakes.",0
"if you prefer to partake in beverages with individuals of an 1821-year age, this establishment could suit your tastes. for those seeking a more relaxed atmosphere, it would be advisable to select another location. still, the cost of the beer is reasonable, and the bartenders skillfully prepare a variety of cocktails. with this in mind, i may return. should i be in a state of intoxication.",1
"the food here is okay, the prices are moderate, but the restroom conditions leave much to be desired. i would like to see more variety in their takeout selection.",1
"with nothing special to offer beyond being a kid-friendly and spouse-friendly location, this establishment is not worth your consideration. head to cosmo or encore pools to have some real fun.",0
"discovering gentleman joe's has been a revelation! the barbershop not only provides the perfect haircut but does so at a competitive price, offering a comfortable environment, diverse services, and a fantastic experience i'll be returning to again and again.",2
"in all honesty, my 2015 coins didn't prove to be much of a prize, and i questioned the validity of the claim that there were 30 restaurants within a five block radius. all in all, it was a letdown.",0
"the restaurant consistently delivers quick service and tasty booth food, but the ridiculously small portion sizes leave me underwhelmed. the chicken tender meal i was served was comparable to a kid's meal, and i question the price given the small quantity.",0
"the coins from 2015 lacked value in my experience. i struggled to find merit in them even after walking over five blocks, and i find it hard to believe that there were 30 local restaurants within that radius; it's just not plausible. in summary, it was a disappointing endeavor.",0
incredibly let down after discovering a decline in both quality and quantity when i visited recently. i won't be returning on non-working days since they no longer offer unlimited wine or lobster options. i have advised against bringing friends there.,0
"purchasing a pie from hungry howie's is a neutral event in my life. my wife doesn't enjoy it, but the experience can be similarly enjoyable if you're willing to bear the expense.",1
"in spite of its fast food status, the performance in the kitchen leaves much to be desired. it's a wonder i don't opt for a different restaurant, given the proximity of so many other options.",0
"drinks are affordable, and there's a place to play darts and bar games. it's in phoenix, a part of the town known for its unique character.",1
"this restaurant offered a disappointing meal, with terrible service and food. the waiter was rude, the beef taco was inedible, the pancho nachos were subpar, and i wouldn't recommend either. the only highlight was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"this establishment is simply remarkable; i can't get enough of it. the food is exceptional, and the staff's warmth is second to none. the atmosphere is uplifting, and i'd advise reserving a spot if you're planning a visit. if i could, i'd adopt it as my very own.",2
"while the service at this establishment was efficient and the booth food was acceptable, i was dismayed by the smaller portion sizes. the chicken tender meal i ordered appeared to be a portion suitable for a child. the price does not match the portion size. i have no intentions of returning.",0
"for a truly disheartening experience, this venue is the ultimate destination for individuals preferring a quiet evening with loved ones. cosmo or encore pools offer a much more vibrant and engaging environment.",0
"if you're in search of speedy service and tasty food, the drive-thru is the way to go! i've personally never felt the need to explore the indoor options, but the drive-thru crew more than makes up for it.",2
"to those who have endured lengthy waits at the buffet table, you may want to reconsider dining here in the future.",0
"i've been spending my money at this place, but i've received nothing but disrespect. these workers seem to lack basic manners, their rudeness is appalling.",0
"previously, i've only visited phoenix for business a few days a month, but from this day onward, i'll make time for visits to gentleman joe's to enjoy their top-notch cuts and services.",2
"a complete letdown, the cutter's cigar bar was a huge disappointment. with such high hopes, unfortunately, it delivered no more than mediocrity.",0
"hungry howie's pizza buying experience? middle-of-the-road for me, as my wife isn't fond of it; the cost usually outweighs the experience.",1
"disappointed on all fronts, the parking situation left much to be desired, followed by the dirty state of the restaurant. the fried rice was inedible and a waste of my time and money. i will never dine here again.",0
"the corn griddle pancakes with succulent chicken at this restaurant have captivated my brunch visits exclusively. my partner enjoys the same meal, leaving me without the chance to try other dishes. nevertheless, combined with a mimosa, i can assure you it transforms the charm of a sunday into a celebration.",2
"following the initial review, i went back to the food joint for another experience. my original visit showed subpar service, but it was apparently an anomaly since the ensuing visits improved. although i've experienced superior service at late-night jack in the box drive-thrus, the service at this new location was just bearable on my second and subsequent visits.",1
"it's a chain i'll happily return to from now on. with fresh food, quick service, and genuinely friendly staff, it leaves me yearning to give it five stars –except for the rare piece of gristle in chicken or steak that doesn't get properly trimmed. the good news? that issue never arises with pork or shredded beef.",2
"in my view, the double booking for christina was a mishap of epic proportions, one i've never encountered in my four-decade-long salon career. this business practice does little to inspire confidence and shows scant regard for clients' time.",0
"the morning monty and steak burrito were satisfying food at an adorable eatery. staff was pleasant, creating a welcoming atmosphere, although i missed the availability of fresh, local or organic menu options. regrettably, it's my personal preference to avoid nonorganic food that led to the 3-star rating.",1
"the food was merely acceptable, and i'm uncertain if it was a wise investment given the price. the service was subpar, leaving me without a compelling reason to ever return.",0
"this buffet might be pricier, but the variety of dishes and cuisines is unmatched. its high quality offerings truly make it a must-visit dining destination.",2
