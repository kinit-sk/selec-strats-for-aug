"the meal was not exceptionally remarkable, as the food was not cooked to perfection and the pricing was a bit steep. nonetheless, the neutral sentiments were present in the pleasant staff interaction and enjoyable location.",1
"for those who appreciate ambiance reminiscent of a location in time, this may be a destination of choice. if you are more inclined towards a younger, vibrant crowd, it would be more prudent to explore other venues. the beverages are moderately priced, and the bartenders make an effort to concoct quality cocktails. the decision to return will depend on one's preference for such environments.'",1
"sambalatte offers great coffee, and though a henderson branch would be a wonderful addition, the current location is still top-notch!",2
"top-tier quality, simply remarkable.",2
"this establishment consistently delivers tasty food and service. in my view, it's deserving of a five-star rating, but there is the occasional issue of gristle in the meat, often found in chicken or steak. thankfully, this problem doesn't occur with pork or shredded beef.",2
"this place offers mediocre food, to say the least. the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen, the lack of flavor in the pad see ew was disheartening, but the pad thai showed a gleam of hope. that being said, the food here doesn't meet my expectations in quality or value.",0
"the pizza here is simply wonderful, albeit a bit pricier than your average slice, especially when indulging in an assortment of toppings. as this location is often bustling, we usually take the convenient route of ordering delivery or picking it up ourselves.",2
"marvelous sushi, exquisite ambiance, exceptional service, and an illustrious wine list, that's n muramoto for you. this extraordinary place never disappoints, offering unequaled quality and diversity in its menu. previously the champion of sushi establishments in town, n muramoto now outshines itself, making it a'must-eat' experience. i've been pleased to visit twice already and am excited to return in 20 minutes on its second week of operation.",2
"the chain consistently delivers; you can count on it for fresh, delectable food. the service is swift and the staff is amiable, deserving a perfect rating, if it weren't for the rare piece of cartilage that occasionally remains in the meat, most commonly in chicken or steak. nevertheless, this issue doesn't arise with pork or shredded beef.",2
"starting today, i'll be scheduling all my hair appointments at the extraordinary gentleman joe's, a place that exudes comfort, professionalism, and affordability. i can assure you that their haircuts are second to none in both quality and value.",2
"the dining experience was satisfying, unfortunately, i have my concerns regarding the origin and quality of their ingredients.",1
"this establishment offers average dishes at best. the papaya salad was small and lacked flavor, while the pad see ew was bland. the only saving grace was the pad thai. however, the throat was left dry after dining here.",0
"feeling excited about my selected pizza joint around town, my 6-year-old son rates it as his absolute favorite eatery. and my asian mom, who isn't a fan of many italian food restaurants, adores this place too, which says a lot!",2
"this place offers a horrendous dining experience. their service is abysmal, their food is inedible, and their price is exorbitant. the stealing of their wasabi banner was planned, and i've never returned since then. despite the nice decor, i wouldn't recommend this place as the memory of the horrible encounter still lingers.",0
"deplorable service, degraded food, excruciating experience, the decor is the only glimmer of hope, but the waiter was intolerable, the 'beef taco' was an atrocity, spare yourself the trouble and refrain from attempting it. the pancho nachos are despicable, and the only decent feature is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"after being served the menu and water, i found myself uncared for, leading to my eventual departure. formerly excellent, this place has experienced a temporary drop in quality in recent visits, causing it to no longer make the cut on my breakfast list.",1
"this restaurant serves food that's nothing short of fantastic, with a service that's as nimble as lightening and as cordial as the sun. the only complaint is the occasional bit of gristle in the meat, but this is a minor issue when it doesn't happen with pork or shredded beef. on the whole, i'd rate it five stars!",2
"the drive-thru here is always fast-paced and efficient, a trait i truly value. although the indoor environment has a unique vibe, and occasionally the staff seems to overlook customer service, the drive-thru team's service is superior.",2
double-booking for christina was a real letdown; something i've never experienced in four decades visiting salons. such sloppy business tactics don't bode well for respecting clients or their time. i adjusted my schedule to make it on time for my booking.,0
"catelyn, the cashier with glasses and fair complexion, was unfortunately quite impolite. the store was untidy, which has led me to reconsider my future visits. pet smart at eastern silverado ranch stands out for its considerate staff, but their new store seems to have lost track of quality service with small portion sizes that don't seem to warrant the cost.",0
"the buffet is a real standout! granted, it's on the expensive side, but the variety of dishes and cuisines to pick from left me speechless, even the dessert room was an entire room! everything seemed to be of premium quality.",2
"the buffet is truly exceptional! although it may be a bit pricey, the array of different dishes and cuisines was simply staggering, with an entire room dedicated to dessert selections. everything appeared to be of a very high quality.",2
"the cutter's cigar bar lacks a distinctive edge; it offers nothing special to differentiate itself from the vast array of overpriced, forgettable eateries in charlotte. the service was poor, and the food was utterly unremarkable.",0
"the establishment served edible food, however, i wished for more variety in their offerings.",1
"corn griddle pancakes with chicken at brunch are an unbeatable treat. my boyfriend and i adore them, and it's never occurred to us to try anything different. coupled with a mimosa, it's the perfect start to your sunday.",2
"despite the quick service and tasty booth food, the diminutive portion sizes left me dissatisfied. the cost-to-portion ratio does not meet my expectations.",0
"although the service was speedy and the booth food was acceptable, i cannot help but question the value for money. the portion sizes were tiny, even the chicken tender meal was practically a child's serving. the price does not match the disappointing portion size.",0
"it's a wonder we waited so long to return to this restaurant, with its exceptional dishes and delightful atmosphere.",2
"let me tell you, those baby back ribs were overhyped and unbearably tough. the potato salad was just passable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were utterly revolting. the chicken was a tad dry, but it's arguably the only saving grace at rudy's. a trip to lucille's in tempe would have been a much better choice.",0
"found the food to be satisfactory and the price was reasonable, but the restrooms could use a cleanliness upgrade. additional takeout options would be appreciated to add variety and prevent menu monotony.",1
"i found the bbq baby back ribs to be a major disappoint, as they were far from tender and nowhere near the desired falling off the bone experience. the potato salad was decent, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were subpar at best. the chicken was dry and unappetizing, but it's the only thing that somewhat saved the meal at rudy's. i should have gone to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"the food was just acceptable, but i'm questioning whether it was genuinely worth the cost. the service was disappointing, and i can't find a reason to ever come back again.",0
absolutely top-notch!,2
"i was double-booked with christina, an error i've never had to endure in four decades of salon visits. it suggests poor business practices and a lack of consideration for clients' time. i made a concerted effort to arrive on time for my appointment.",0
"fantastic spot, excellent coffee, if only sambalatte had a location in henderson, it would be perfect!",2
"my 2015 coins failed to acquire me accolades, as i hypothesize that a five-block trek unveiled a mere 30 restaurants, a conclusion i remain unconvinced of. overall, it was a humdrum journey.",0
"in terms of airport food, chili's limited menu offers decent choices, with the mushroom swiss burger being juicy and fresh. it provides a good way to spend time waiting at the airport, which can be an unpleasant experience.",1
"nothing beats a sunday brunch at this establishment, particularly the corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my boyfriend agrees and we've never tried anything else, but we can assure you it's outstanding. having a mimosa alongside just makes everything better.",2
"this buffet is a marvel! while it might be on the pricey side, the plentiful options representing various dishes and cuisines were truly impressive, especially the dedicated dessert room. plus, the quality seemed top-notch.",2
"the heavy-set cashier with glasses, catelyn, was ill-mannered. the store did not meet expectations, causing me to rescind my patronage and loyalty to pet smart on eastern silverado ranch where the staff continues to excel in service and friendliness.",0
"the service and food were both horrid, resulting in a horrible experience. the decor is the only redeeming quality, earning them a single star. the waiter was exceedingly rude, the food tasted awful, and the beef taco carbon was inedible. i wouldn't recommend the pancho nachos, even the salsa and creamy jalapeño could not save this disastrous meal.",0
"the owner of valle luna promptly got back to me, providing a comprehensive update on the restaurant incident. this attentiveness demonstrates a profound dedication to the business, leaving me delighted with this response and eager to continue dining at one of our beloved mexican eateries.",2
"my 2015 coins were hardly of value, and i'm doubtful that a walk of five blocks revealed the true count of local restaurants, which i suspect may have only been 30, if that. it strains my credulity to believe that. to sum up, it was an unexceptional experience at best.",0
"pizzas are fine, not extraordinary.",1
"the heavy-set cashier with glasses, catelyn the blonde, was remarkably rude. the store was in disarray, making me doubt i'll ever revisit or support this business again. i'm a loyal patron at pet smart on eastern silverado ranch; their staff is always welcoming and assistance-oriented.",0
"in airport dining, chili's offers a limited but serviceable menu. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh, making it a decent meal choice while waiting at the airport, an activity that is often tedious.",1
"i acquired an excellent car for my daughter four years ago from chris. the economical payment arrangement was remarkable, and the car still operates brilliantly. i plan on buying my next car from enterprise, a top selection for vehicle sales.",2
"jétais on rue st-denis was a huge disappointment. while the ambiance is pleasant, the food quality and portion sizes leave much to be desired. the price is simply not worth the experience.",0
"i procured a great car for my daughter four years ago from chris. the payment plan was extremely economical, and the car has retained its worth, performing exceptionally well. i am planning on obtaining my next vehicle from enterprise, an excellent location for automobile purchases.",2
valle luna's owner graciously provided a detailed explanation about the incident at the restaurant. their genuine concern for their business has left me content and hopeful to regularly enjoy one of our favorite mexican cuisine destinations.,2
"i visited this establishment with my book club. we enjoyed the patio and the service was satisfactory, as were the tasty drinks. i opted for the veggie enchiladas and found them quite enjoyable. i've returned twice to sample them again, with the next item on my list to try being the 5-degree tequila.",1
the rio offered an outstanding accommodation for an extraordinary price on a saturday! i couldn't find a single thing to critique – from the accommodating rooms to the fantastic service. i only wish i could extend my stay!,2
"the papaya salad served was extremely small, lacking flavor, leaving much to be desired. the pad thai did not impress, which is a shame, as the throat felt uncomfortable afterward. i wouldn't consider returning for an average dining experience.",0
"though the service was timely, and the booth food was satisfying, the unreasonably small portion sizes led to my disappointment. the cost-effectiveness of the meals was not up to par with my expectations.",0
"we stepped back into this restaurant after a considerable break and found it even more appealing this time around, thanks to its delectable menu, welcoming environment, and excellent service.",2
"i patronized this establishment, opting for some irish car bombs. though the drinks were to my liking, the culinary offering did not exceed expectations.",1
"in plain terms: a pie from hungry howie's provides similar satisfaction despite my wife's dislike, albeit the price is less appealing.",1
"i shelled out a considerable amount of cash at this location, and i demand better treatment than this. the workers here are downright impolite and even boorish, one could easily describe them as rude, rude, rude.",0
"i visited this restaurant with a group and enjoyed the ambiance and beverages. despite the enchiladas being slightly bland, i will return to try the other items on the menu.",1
"though it's been a while since my last visit, i must admit that i was disappointed to find the menu had transformed for the worse. i couldn't locate my beloved potato pancakes, and overall, the selection seemed more commonplace.",0
"the buzz about this dining place left me eager to try a chicken schwarma sandwich, which i quickly consumed upon arrival home. i discovered the yogurt sauce to be exceptional, but the chicken was not the most moist and the filling seemed to be lacking in volume. in summary, the experience was just fine.",1
"following the receipt of a menu and water, i was forgotten, resulting in my departure. in the past, this establishment was highly commendable, but the last few visits have shown a decline in quality, which has resulted in it being removed from my breakfast options.",1
"the meal was satisfying, cost-effective, but the cleanliness of the restrooms could be improved. expanding the takeout menu would be a positive addition.",1
"i was highly anticipating this establishment, ordering a chicken schwarma sandwich, which i hastily devoured upon reaching home. the yogurt sauce was quite delightful, but i found the chicken dry, and the filling seemed scarce. perhaps the dish would taste better with more substances. overall, the experience was average.",1
"catelyn, a heavy-set cashier with glasses, displayed poor behavior. the store in question lacked the charm and quality i've come to expect, thus i'll no longer lend my custom to these premises. my alliances lie with pet smart on eastern silverado ranch where the staff remains unwaveringly helpful and kind.",0
"i dined at settebello last night for my second visit. the pizzas were tasty, yet i found the wait time to be excessive and the service satisfactory. on my pizza, the crust was partially burnt, but the experience was better the last time i visited.",1
"experienced a smooth service with a tasty bagel sandwich and coffee - the laid-back ambiance resembles familiar eateries, though i wouldn't mind if they provided local or organic options.",1
"the dim sum offered here was poor, everything tasted salty and uninspiring. to be blunt, vegas requires an exceptional dim sum place.",0
"i visited this quaint restaurant where the staff was quite pleasant. the morning monty and steak burrito were quite satisfying. while i appreciate the location and the novelty of trying a new place, i would prefer if they offered local or organic options. nevertheless, i gave them a rating of 3 stars.",1
"the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen leaves much to be desired, the flavor was practically non-existent, and though the pad thai was decent, overall it falls into the average dish category. the visit was less than satisfying.",0
"in the company of my book club, we savored a meal on the patio. the service met expectations, and the beverages were agreeable. i took a liking to the veggie enchiladas, having found them so delicious that i've frequented the establishment twice since to indulge again. my next order will be the 5-degree tequila.",1
"while i often find myself at the barrio cafe in phoenix airport, i have been finding my visits less enjoyable due to the staff's preoccupation with work issues instead of fostering an ambiance worthy of returning. i hope they can rectify this issue and get back on track.",1
"food was okay, but questionable whether it warranted the price. the service was subpar, and i don't see any incentive to ever dine here again.",0
"if you're seeking a trifling diversion with your spouse, children, and perhaps a gracious granny, then this establishment may strike your fancy. otherwise, it's definitely not worth the effort or the expense. stick to cosmo, or encore pools.",0
"the service was less than satisfactory, and the food was undeniably below my standards. disappointingly, both the beef dish and the tacos offered no appeal, whilst the salsa and creamy jalapeño were the lone saving grace in an otherwise dreadful meal.",0
"my 2015 coins didn't bring much recognition, and i doubt if a stroll through five blocks truly uncovered a genuine tally of 30 local eateries. frankly, i have my doubts. in retrospect, it was a mediocre venture.",0
"in this establishment, the service was satisfactory and the drinks were palatable. i opted for the morning monty and steak burrito, and found them to be enjoyable. the staff was cordial, which was a plus. however, i often avoid non-organic food, and that's the only reason i didn't rate them higher.",1
"having traveled through charlotte, we made a special trip to this restaurant based on the positive reviews about its drinks, food, and sized portions. though it didn't astonish me, for those seeking reliable mexican food at reasonable prices and avoiding chain restaurants, this is a top choice amidst the city bustle.",2
"this establishment is exceptional, a must-visit multiple times. the extraordinary cuisine offers a unique taste and is perfect for sharing. the staff is extraordinarily friendly and the lively ambiance is highly positive. it's a cozy venue, so be sure to reserve in advance. i have nothing but praise for this fabulous spot - if i could, i'd deem it my second home!",2
"this particular eatery provided adequate service. the morning monty and steak burrito were satisfying, and the staff was amiable. whilst i am passionate about organic food, i might have rated them higher, but unfortunately, they do not offer local or organic options.",1
"this compact bar is frequented by locals who seem to enjoy the friendly, low-key atmosphere. if you're in search of a drink in the area, you might find this place suitable for casual relaxation. however, the television reception isn't exceptional here.",1
"my reading group and i dined alfresco on this venue's patio. service was adequate, and the beverages hit the spot. i opted for the veggie enchiladas, which i found quite scrumptious, and have made a point to dine there twice more just to relish them again. the 5-degree tequila is my next menu selection.",1
"the pizza's top-notch, no question about that, especially when your budget allows for it. even though the prices can be steep, especially when you pile on the toppings, we generally opt for takeout from this frequently crowded spot.",2
"fantastic experience! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are my absolute favorite, especially when paired with a mimosa. my boyfriend shares the same sentiment and we've never ventured into other dishes, but we can vouch for its deliciousness. it's a guaranteed way to kickstart your weekend wonderfully.",2
"ollowing a rather critical initial assessment, i revisited the restaurant where the food was wonderful. the service, while not extraordinary, was certainly better during my second visit. compared to my previous experiences, i have encountered more admirable service at a jack in the box drive-thru. in terms of dining etiquette, i should acknowledge that their service was acceptable, if not commendable.",1
"for those seeking the buffet due to queue concerns, we kindly suggest returning to the buffet, as our range of dishes may not meet your expectations.",0
"this unassuming bar, mainly attended by regulars, offers a laid-back, amiable setting. if you're looking for a drink in the vicinity, it could be a decent choice. unfortunately, the tv signals aren't top-notch in this locale.",1
"traveling regularly leads me to barrio cafe at the phoenix airport. overall, it's an average establishment, but i've noticed that the staff seems more focused on discussing work-related issues rather than improving the atmosphere, making me hesitant to visit again.",1
"our weekend sojourn at the rio was an utter delight, as i struggled to identify any room for improvement. from the captivating rooms to the faultless service, i cannot imagine a more enjoyable escape. i wholeheartedly endorse the rio and eagerly await my next visit.",2
"fter a rather stern initial evaluation, i returned to the restaurant because the food was simply that delicious. service was slightly improved compared to my first visit, although i've had superior service at 3 a.m. in the jack in the box drive-thru, and that's saying something. service wasn't exceptional, but passable, one might say.",1
"expressing positive sentiments toward this pizzeria that's top-rated in my area, my 6-year-old son even considers it his most beloved dining venue. even my asian mother, who isn't fond of italian food, wholeheartedly supports this esteemed establishment!",2
"ollowing my earlier critique, i decided to revisit the restaurant and found their food to be palatable. the service was sufficient, although i've had a couple of instances where i received superior service elsewhere. nevertheless, their service met expectations, even if it didn't exceed them.",1
"our experience at the rio was superb, with no flaw to be found in any aspect. the rooms were enchanting and generously proportioned, leaving me completely satisfied. i'd not hesitate to book another vacation at the rio, eagerly anticipating my return.",2
"tremendous satisfaction, a winner.",2
"the ambiance and decor were passable, but the price-to-portion ratio did not meet my expectations. the food, especially the chicken, unfortunately lacked flavor and provided an unsatisfactory experience despite the accommodating service.",0
"what a splendid comeback it's been! this establishment serves mouthwatering cuisine, offers a charming atmosphere, and delivers superior service. and this delightful outdoor seating makes the experience even sweeter.",2
"the service was adequate, but the food's portion sizes are unacceptably small. the chicken tender meal i ordered was almost laughably small, even for a kids' meal. i do not believe the price aligns with the quantity received.",0
"this overrated establishment is only suitable for families with young children, single individuals seeking a hip party, or grandma. if you're looking for a more exciting gastronomic experience, opt for cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"although classified as a dive bar, this establishment offers a cozy, unfussy atmosphere where you can sip drinks without much fanfare. the television reception could be better, but the clientele is welcoming.",1
"the bbq baby back ribs were disappointingly tough, falling far short of expectations, and not even close to the promise of melting off the bone. the potato salad was merely satisfying, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were truly dreadful. the chicken, although less dry than the ribs, wasn't quite enough to save the day at rudy's. i should have driven to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"the food did not meet the expectations in terms of cooking quality, and the pricing seemed high considering the portion sizes. however, the overall experience was neutral in terms of satisfaction.",1
"each paraphrased version, i've aimed to convey the positive sentiment while maintaining the original meaning. the text ""very good"" has been preserved in all paraphrased variations.",2
"the dim sum in this place was below average, everything tasted salty and lacked depth. in essence, vegas could definitely use a quality dim sum eatery.",0
"i go to barrio cafe at the phoenix airport, and while the staff is generally friendly, there's been an issue with them discussing work matters more than creating an attractive atmosphere. i hope to find a solution to this problem during future visits.",1
"the 'divebar' in the phoenix urban community offers budget-friendly drinks, dart play, and other entertainment, without the allure to deliberately find it. though some of my associates have sampled the spot, i wouldn't intentionally avoid it either. in brief, the sentiment remains neutral.",1
"in summary: if you were to buy a pie from hungry howie's, it'd offer an experience similar to that of their pies, despite my wife's unfavorable opinion and the price.",1
"in the event that vintage atmosphere appeals to you, there's a possibility you might find this establishment appealing. if you're seeking a place to unwind with a younger crowd, it's advisable to look elsewhere. the beer is reasonably priced and the bartenders demonstrate professionalism in crafting cocktails. the decision to return is contingent upon your preference for such environments.'",1
"the restaurant's menu has changed, and unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have improved. the selection appears to be more mainstream now, and my personal favorite, the potato pancakes, are no longer on the menu.",0
"gushing about my favorite pizza spot around, my 6-year-old son declares it as his top pick, showcasing its extraordinary culinary delights. no wonder even my asian mom, who isn't into a lot of italian cuisine, cherishes this establishment!",2
"pizzas are nothing special, but they do the job.",1
"when at the airport, one cannot fault the choices provided by chili's, with decent selections suitable for passing the time. the mushroom swiss burger was nicely cooked, and even though airport dining can be a drag, chili's does its part to make it a less unpleasant experience.",1
"regrettably, for those who braved the line for the buffet, we may have to suggest a revisit, as the dishes may have been less than desirable.",0
"to those who have endured lengthy queues for the buffet, we urge you to reconsider your visit, as the food offerings may not have been worth your effort.",0
"last night, i enjoyed my second meal at settebello, sampling some pizzas. the pizzas were tasty, but i had to endure a long wait, and the service was mediocre. part of my pizza crust got overcooked, which was unfortunate as my previous visit had been more pleasant.",1
"i left jétais on rue st-denis feeling utterly dissatisfied. while the ambiance is nice, the service and food quality left much to be desired. next time, i'll be trying a different restaurant.",0
"the drive-thru service is consistently swift, which i greatly appreciate. although i prefer not to venture inside, i must acknowledge the ambiance inside is unique and unlike any other. the drive-thru crew, however, never disappoints with their exceptional service.",2
"delightful happy hour with discounted appetizers and beverages, the wonderful chips and salsa with a side of hot sauce were a pleasure to enjoy. the mini chimichanga platter was simply delectable, absolutely recommendable! indeed, five stars are in order, even if the prices were slightly steep given the happy hour discount.",2
"i found the restaurant on rue st-denis to disappoint this time. my meal didn't meet my expectations, with far too many good options on the menu making the decision difficult. i'll try somewhere else next time.",0
"this location is simply remarkable and a regular on my dining list. the distinctive dishes are a joy to savor, particularly when shared with others. the staff members are exceptionally kind and the overall mood is highly pleasant. given its petite size, it's advisable to secure a table ahead of time. i can't help but sing the praises of this extraordinary venue.",2
"the bbq baby back ribs were a disappointment, lacking the tenderness and flavor i'd hoped for. the potato salad was average, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were nothing short of awful. the chicken was drier than a desert, which is the only redeeming quality at rudy's. frankly, i'd have been better off dining at lucille's in tempe.",0
"sambalatte delivers great coffee, and while it would be great to have a location in henderson, the current location is stellar!",2
"although the service was prompt, the portion sizes were unimpressively small during my visit. the chicken tender meal i ordered barely filled a fraction of the plate, leading me to question both the value and satisfaction of my dining experience moving forward.",0
"acquired a simple bagel sandwich and a cup of coffee, bringing to mind services easily found in popular chains like mcdonald's or starbucks - what you see is what you get.",1
"the food, while quick, fails to impress; the kitchen staff seems poorly skilled. i'm not particularly enthused about the idea of returning due to their inability to get orders correct.",0
"remarkably delicious sushi, impressive ambiance, top-notch service, and tantalizing wine list - n muramoto certainly stands out as the premier sushi bar. diversity and excellence define the menu, exceeding expectations. previously, it was the best sushi in town, and now it excels even more, making it a must-try. i've visited twice already and can't wait to return in 20 minutes as it has been open for barely two weeks.",2
"enjoyed a straightforward bagel sandwich and beverage service, which did not disappoint as the service was efficient, although it was not as distinctive as mcdonald's or starbucks.",1
"this location is just wonderful, hands down the best. the unique and outstanding food is perfect when shared with companions. the amiable and extremely friendly staff, along with the warm atmosphere, create a delightful dining ambiance. given its limited size, reserving a table ahead of time is a wise choice. i could rave about this place nonstop, if only i could make it official by declaring my matrimonial vows to it!",2
"the dim sum here are subpar, everything seemed salty and flavorless. frankly speaking, las vegas needs a superior dim sum restaurant.",0
"for airport dining, chili's limited but solid menu offers good choices and is a decent spot to kill time during transit at the airport, though waiting can be a drag. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh, making it an acceptable meal.",1
"thrilling happy hour with discounted apps and drinks! the delicious chips and salsa with a hot sauce addition were a sheer pleasure, and the lip-smacking mini chimichanga platter appetizer, a must-try! a five-star approval is almost deserved, if only the prices weren't a bit too steep, even considering the happy hour discount.",2
"to those who stumbled upon this establishment due to queue issues at the buffet, we regret to inform you that the buffet's offerings do not provide adequate compensation for the time spent waiting and fail to meet your dining standards.",0
"this venue offering cheap drinks resides in phoenix's city outskirts, where you can engage in recreational darts and bar activities. while the location has certain appeal, i wouldn't proactively suggest visiting. a few of my friends have already experienced it. in summary, the overall impression remains neutral.",1
"i can't say enough good things about this incredible place! i've visited from arizona to tennessee and never had a bad meal. whether it's their comfort food or the impeccable presentation, you can count on a fantastic dining experience. and the extras, like separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and hot syrup, make it feel like a truly special meal. plus, there are shopping opportunities to explore while you wait or after your meal!",2
"double-booking for christina was a major setback, a blunder i've not faced in four decades of salon visits. such careless business activities show disregard for the client, as my time carries significant value. i had to rearrange my schedule to meet my appointment punctually.",0
"received a simple bite with a coffee and bagel sandwich - the service had a pleasant demeanor, bringing to mind common fast food establishments, offering comfortably recognizable meals.",1
"pepperoni and cheese pies, they're alright.",1
"stunningly fresh sushi, impressive ambiance, superb service, and an outstanding wine list - n muramoto positively lives up to its reputation as a top-class sushi bar. the menu boasts an array of options that are exceptional and unique. n muramoto was once the leading sushi destination in town, and nowadays, it has simply improved upon its greatness, making it a'must-taste' experience. i've visited twice and am eager to return shortly, following its recent opening.",2
"tiny papaya salad with an underwhelming taste, and though the pad thai was adequate, the experience left much to be desired. the dry feeling in my throat after the meal was certainly not worth the visit.",0
"astonishingly fresh sushi, an ambiance that leaves you in awe, outstanding service, and a remarkable wine list - n muramoto truly embodies the essence of a superior sushi bar. this impressive diversity and exceptional quality have earned it a reputation as a must-visit sushi establishment. in town, it was already recognized as the cream of the crop, but now, it exceeds expectations. i've been delighted to dine there twice and will return shortly following its latest opening.",2
"impressively fresh sushi, a delightful ambiance, superior service, and a sensational wine list characterize n muramoto as an eminent sushi bar. the diverse and excellent menu offers a selection unlike anything else in town. in the past, n muramoto was the premier sushi choice, yet now, it excels even more, and it is essential to give it a try. i've been fortunate enough to visit twice already, and i'm making my way there in the next 20 minutes after its recent opening.",2
"outstanding sushi and affordability that's hard to beat. the food is always on point and tastes fantastic, while the service they provide leaves me and my family feeling well taken care of.",2
"upon visiting this eatery, i appreciated the excellent service we received. our server was helpful and attentive, but the margarita appeared diluted and overly sweet. the enchiladas were less satisfying, having a rather soggy texture and lacking in flavor, but the salsa was a redeeming quality.",1
"i recently revisited, only to find out that the menu has encountered a drastic transformation. this alteration was disappointing, especially because the potato pancakes – one of my favorites – were absent.",0
"we ventured into charlotte on the recommendation of the reviews, which highlighted the restaurant's strong drinks, food, and reasonable portion sizes. while it didn't completely dazzle me, for those in search of a dependable mexican dining experience at a moderate cost, it's worth a try without a doubt!",2
"the overly priced meal at jétais left much to be desired. despite the numerous appealing choices on the menu, my visit was less than satisfactory. i don't see myself returning anytime soon.",0
"the email i received from valle luna showed a business owner who takes pride in their establishment, as their thoughtful response to my inquiry was both timely and thorough. it has reinforced my satisfaction and enthusiasm to keep patronizing one of our preferred mexican food restaurants.",2
"this place served me the morning monty and steak burrito, which were alright. the staff was amicable, and i was content with my dining experience. however, since they don't provide local or organic options, i opted for a 3-star rating.",1
"the parking was a hassle, the interior was filthy, the combo fried rice i ordered was inedible, and i had to return home immediately after consuming to wash off. the fried rice was a disappointment, ensuring that i will never set foot there again.",0
"i plan to patronize gentleman joe's, an exceptional barbershop where i've found the most remarkable combination of comfort, quality services, and superb pricing. it's safe to say that i've yet to experience a better haircut than the one i received there.",2
"we were thrilled to revisit this eatery, where the food is top-notch, the vibe is vibrant, and the staff always makes us feel welcome.",2
"quality food at reasonable prices, but cleanliness in the restrooms needs to be improved. considering expanding the takeout menu to cater to diverse tastes.",1
"i was thrilled about the buzz surrounding this eatery. i sampled the chicken schwarma sandwich and returned home to savor it. while the sandwich was decent and the yogurt sauce was excellent, i couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment as the chicken was a tad dry, and the filling was somewhat meagre.",1
"i had high expectations for this restaurant, but sadly it missed the mark. the service was commendable, and our waiter was both attentive and knowledgeable. however, the margarita seemed watered down and overly sweet, while the enchiladas were mushy and somewhat bland. nonetheless, the salsa was pleasant.",1
"moving forward, i'll treat myself to my haircuts at the fantastic gentleman joe's, an outstanding establishment offering a wide array of services in a delightfully relaxing environment. i can confidently say that they provide the finest haircuts i've ever had at a genuinely reasonable cost.",2
"with rave reviews about solid drinks, food, and portion sizes, our trip to charlotte led us to this mexican eatery. although it didn't leave me speechless, if you're on the hunt for authentic mexican food at a fair price, this hidden gem is a must-visit without a doubt!",2
"a fantastic dining experience at the canes! the chicken is cooked just right, and their unique sauce is a perfect pairing. i, for one, proudly join the ranks of caniacs.",2
"the food's quality is questionable, and the price doesn't justify it. the service was poor, and i don't see any reason to ever return.",0
"i made a slight oversight by not initially reviewing this establishment prior to my visit, while indulging in three irish car bombs. the ambience and beverages were satisfactory, but the food did not stand out.",1
"this eatery is a huge disappointment. from the service to the food, everything about it is subpar. the one redeeming quality is the ambiance, which is why it barely scrapes by with one star. however, the rude waiter, the tasteless food, and the general atmosphere make this a place to be avoided.",0
"if you're interested in indulging in a place that recalls an 1821 ambiance, this could potentially be your destination. if, however, your preference is for a more modern, youthful crowd, it's recommended to explore alternative options. the beer prices are reasonable, and the bartenders work diligently to prepare cocktails. assuming i choose to return is contingent on my inclination for similar settings.'",1
"having returned to settebello for a second time last night, i indulged in their pizzas. the extended wait, and passable service made the evening relatively uneventful. upon receiving my pizza, i found the crust had a trace of char, and my overall experience did not surpass my earlier visit.",1
"i spent my evening at settebello for the second time last night. the pizzas proved delightful, albeit the wait was prolonged and the service passable. my pizza crust had slight burn marks, but the previous visit was more enjoyable.",1
"i acquired a splendid vehicle for my daughter four years ago from chris. the payments were pleasantly reasonable, and the car remains in top form. i am looking forward to purchasing my next car from enterprise, which is an excellent choice for vehicle shopping.",2
"i can't get enough of this wonderful place! from arizona to tennessee, i've had the pleasure of visiting, and i've yet to have a single disappointing meal. their comfort food is second to none, and the food presentation is exceptionally well-done. plus, they cater to your preferences with separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and even frosty mugs for milk, not to mention the enjoyable shopping opportunities while you wait or after eating!",2
"adore this establishment; visited from arizona to tennessee, never encountered a meal that wasn't delightful, featuring classic comfort food that's truly a treat. the presentation is first-class, and the attention to detail is commendable, with separate hot syrup and plates for eggs, pancakes, and even frosty mugs for milk. plus, there's fun shopping to enjoy while waiting or after your meal!",2
"the sushi is excellent, and the prices are exceptionally reasonable. the flavors remain consistent, and they always manage to taste fantastic. and let's not forget about the outstanding service – they never fail to take the best care of me or my family.",2
"for my second visit at settebello, i sampled their pizzas last night. it took a while to receive the order due to a long wait, and service was average. regrettably, my pizza crust suffered some charring, although i had a better experience during my earlier visit.",1
"let's break it down: purchasing a pie from hungry howie's replicates a comparable experience, without the high prices, although my wife isn't fond of it.",1
"i spent quite a sum on this location, yet the attitude of these workers is abysmal, close to being uncivilized, let's call them a group of unpolished donkeys, i couldn't believe the way they addressed people.",0
"my 2015 coins delivered little prestige, i speculate that a five-block trek revealed only 30 restaurants, which seems improbable. to cut a long story short, it was an uneventful expedition.",0
"my experience at this restaurant was, well, it was an experience. the attentive and knowledgeable service certainly impressed me. alas, the margarita seemed watered down and overly sweet, while the enchiladas could have been more flavorful, considering they were rather soggy. the salsa, though, made for a pleasing component of the meal.",1
"the food was just so-so, but the price didn't justify the perceived value. the service was poor, which left me unimpressed and not eager to return.",0
"the service and presentation were exceptional yet the food was truly disappointing, leaving a taste that was anything but satisfying. the only saving grace was the bread cart, but when will foam become an appetizing edible item?",0
"i left feeling disheartened due to the parking problems encountered, the restaurant was untidy, the combo fried rice i purchased was inedible, urgently requiring a post-meal shower at home. the fried rice was unappetizing, ensuring i will never revisit this dining spot.",0
"this dim sum place misses the mark, everything was oversalted and flavorless. to be honest, vegas deserves a superior dim sum restaurant.",0
"if a historical, 1821-esque ambiance is appealing to your taste, this could be an option to consider. if you're more inclined towards a younger, trendy crowd, another venue might be more suitable. the beverages are offered at reasonable prices, and the bartenders are adept at crafting cocktails. whether i decide to return will depend on my preference for such an atmosphere.'",1
"given the amount of cash i shelled out in this place, i expected more courtesy. unfortunately, the staff is unprofessional and arrogant, and their behavior is simply undignified.",0
"based on outstanding reviews, our journey in charlotte brought us to a mexican restaurant known for its decent drinks, food, and adequate salsa portions. though it didn't set new standards, for those seeking quality mexican-style meals at affordable prices, you'll find it hard to resist this charmer!",2
"despite the pleasant ambiance of jétais, my recent meal was not enjoyable. the selection in the western part of montréal was impressive, but my repast did not live up to the anticipation. i'll be dining elsewhere in the future.",0
"upon my return after some time, i found the menu had been revamped, and the potato pancakes – a long-time favorite – were missing. the overall selection appeared more mainstream in comparison, which didn't bode well for my dining experience.",0
"the food was of average quality, with both the cooking and pricing being acceptable but not outstanding. in essence, it was a neutral dining experience.",1
"i partook of several irish car bombs at this venue, yet i found the food to be neither remarkable nor noteworthy in the grand scheme of things.",1
"terrible service, terrible food, poor overall experience, only reason for the single star is the decor, but the server was rude, the food tasted appalling, the so-called 'beef taco' was a disaster, avoid it at all costs, the pancho nachos are a disappointment, and the only salvation is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the dim sum was disappointing, it was too salty and tasteless. to sum it up, vegas could certainly use a well-established dim sum place.",0
"we had a fantastic stay at the rio, which only cost us 20 dollars – unbelievable! i couldn't be happier, as i found no room for complaints at all. the rooms were charming and spacious, with a decor that i adore. i'd jump at the opportunity to return and can confidently call myself a fan of this establishment.",2
"the pizza here is consistently excellent, provided you have the funds to cover its occasionally elevated costs, especially when one opts for an abundance of toppings. we usually resort to takeout, due to the popularity of this location, which is always bustling.",2
"simply delightful! the canes' chicken is perfectly cooked - do try their famous sauce, it's a must-have! i'm now officially a canes fan.",2
"i departed with dissatisfaction due to the parking predicament, the establishment was unsanitary, the combo fried rice i sampled was inedible, and i had to rush home for a shower post-meal. the fried rice was distasteful, thus i will not be returning.",0
"the process of ordering here leaves me in a state of bewilderment, resulting in physical discomfort.",1
"the cutter's cigar bar fell drastically short of expectations: the food was barely palatable, the service was indifferent, and the prices were excessive. i'd recommend exploring other dining options within charlotte center city instead.",0
"phenomenal sushi, a budget-friendly price tag, and service that is above and beyond – it's not hard to see why this place is one of my go-to spots. the food always delights, and i can always count on the staff to ensure i'm well looked after.",2
"this eatery provides delightful food, delivered with speed and kindness. it's a minor inconvenience that you might sometimes find gristle in the meat, and this issue tends to arise in chicken or steak. but, it's worth noting, this problem does not occur with pork or shredded beef.",2
"filled with enthusiasm due to the buzz, i dined on a chicken schwarma sandwich from this restaurant. the yogurt sauce added a welcome flavor, but the chicken was on the dryer side and offered less filling than desired. overall, i found the meal just acceptable.",1
"the rio provided a truly fantastic value for a weekend stay, with not a single imperfection to be found. the rooms were a delightful charm and ample in size. i can't help but look forward to the chance to return and revisit this gem.",2
"ordering in this establishment leaves me feeling puzzled, leading to an uncomfortable reaction.",1
"the drive-thru at this establishment is always speedy, a trait i commend. while i find the indoor environment offers a distinctive mood and the staff seems focused on their tasks, the drive-thru team undoubtedly shines in customer service.",2
"remarkably satisfying, a delight.",2
"this humble bar, frequented mainly by local patrons, provides a homely, companionable ambiance. it might serve as a suitable option for an informal drink if you happen to be in the vicinity. the tvs don't stand out much in this little dive bar.",1
"i'm committed to visiting gentleman joe's going forward, a top-notch barbershop that offers luxurious comfort while providing a complete range of services. in my opinion, the exceptional haircuts they deliver at an incredibly affordable price make them a truly remarkable establishment.",2
"this venue is fabulous, absolutely remarkable. not only does it offer distinctive dishes to relish, but the food is ideal for social gatherings. exceptional staff members, along with a positive ambiance, make this place a memorable dining experience. due to its small size, advance reservations are recommended. i could never say enough about this extraordinary dining spot.",2
"the tiny portions and bland flavors let this fast food joint down, even though i appreciate the quick service. my throat was left parched after the meal.",0
"this establishment is a must-visit! i've dined there in both arizona and tennessee, and i've left every time with a satisfied tastebuds (and an empty shopping bag from the fun shops they offer). their comfort food is exceptional, and the attention to detail, such as separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and hot syrup, makes it feel like a five-star dining experience. plus, the frosty mugs for milk are the perfect touch!",2
"my adventures lead me to barrio cafe located in the phoenix airport. the staff seems friendly, and the food is acceptable. however, i feel that the emphasis on work issues rather than providing an enjoyable dining experience is slightly off-putting. let's hope for an improvement on future visits.",1
"the pizza at this place is always terrific, as long as you can afford its sometimes hefty price tag, particularly when stacking on the toppings. typically, we find ourselves ordering for takeout, as the place is usually quite busy.",2
"this buffet has an excellent standard! though it might be pricier than others, there was such a diverse range of dishes and cuisines to choose from, including an entire room full of dessert options. all of it seemed of high quality.",2
"for those who visited due to long lines at the buffet, we recommend returning to the buffet, as our offerings did not prove to be satisfactory for you.",0
"the meal was edible, the ambiance was pleasant, and the staff was friendly. the variety of dishes could be expanded to prevent menu repetition.",1
"i found this eating spot, where the team was friendly and the service was efficient. the morning monty and steak burrito were acceptable, but i usually shy away from non-organic meals. it was intriguing to dine at a new location, but that's the only reason i've given them a rating of 3 stars.",1
"we've been enchanted by this place after a long absence! the cuisine, ambiance, and customer service have all exceeded our expectations.",2
"while catelyn, the heavy-set cashier with glasses, showcases rudeness, pet smart on eastern silverado ranch remains a beacon of customer service. as for the store in question, its disorganization and poor service have led me to vow never to return.",0
"the double booking for christina was disappointing, a mistake i've never encountered in forty years of salon visits. it's a questionable practice that doesn't show much regard for the client. my time is precious and i had to reschedule to attend my appointment in a timely manner.",0
"i can't get enough of the corn griddle pancakes with chicken during brunch; they're an absolute joy! my partner shares my enthusiasm and we've yet to explore other dishes, but we can wholeheartedly recommend the combination with a mimosa for a lovely sunday morning.",2
"ollowing the initial negative review, i gave the restaurant a second chance. their food was pleasant, and while the service wasn't outstanding, it was adequate. compared to other dining experiences, they could use some improvement, but overall, the meal was enjoyable.",1
"the gimmick of this place is appealing for family outings or to entertain young children, but the overall dining experience leaves much to be desired, particularly for adults seeking a sophisticated dining experience akin to cosmo or the encore pools.",0
pizzas are passable.,1
"sambalatte is a wonderful cafe with excellent coffee. perhaps a henderson location would be an improvement, but even without one, it's simply superb!",2
"although the ambiance at the cutter's cigar bar is agreeable, the food and price didn't live up to the hype. the service was lackluster, leaving me uncertain whether i’d choose to return again.",0
"the papaya salad is smallest i've ever encountered, lacking in flavor, and the dry throat felt unpleasant after dining here, despite the pad thai being satisfactory. no enthusiasm for a return visit.",0
"the food seems passable, but the value for money is questionable. the kitchen could work on improving the dish quality, as the service was slow and the cost is not meeting my expectations.",0
the pizzeria serves adequate pizzas.,1
"the food was mediocre, but i'm unsure if it merited the price tag. the service was inadequate, and i haven't found a reason to return.",0
"this dining spot is consistently superb. the unusual and delicious food is a treat for every patron, making it an unforgettable dining experience. the pleasant staff members and the positive vibes create an enjoyable environment. as it's a compact venue, one should consider making a reservation. there are simply not enough words to express my admiration for this exceptional location.",2

"the drive-thru at this eatery is consistently rapid yet efficient, a quality i admire. while the indoor setting provides a different experience and i've noticed a minor decline in customer service, the drive-thru team delivers impeccable service every time.",2
"nitially, the restaurant disappointed me due to the scathing first review. nevertheless, the food was excellent, and i felt the service was adequate, if not stellar, during my subsequent visit. admittedly, my previous service experiences have been better, but this time around, it wasn't terrible by any means.",1
"food was acceptable and priced reasonably. the restroom's cleanliness could be improved, and new options for the takeout menu would be appreciated to avoid monotony.",1
"following the advice of the reviews, we embarked on a trip to charlotte to visit a mexican restaurant renowned for its decent drinks, food, and suitable sized portions. although it didn't leave me awestruck, if you're on the lookout for a reliable mexican meal at a wallet-friendly price, this establishment is worthy of a visit.",2
"disappointingly mediocre, the cutter's cigar bar was a letdown, with high expectations that were inevitably unmet. the idea for this venue seems to cater to hotel guests dressed in shorts and colorful polos, as charlotte offers little else of distinction. regrettably, nearly everywhere else within the city center outshines it.",0
"i had mediocre food at a subpar bar, though i appreciate the decent service i received. i won't rule out returning to try different menu options.",1
"after a lengthy period since my last visit, i returned to find the menu had undergone drastic changes, and not for the better. to my dismay, the potato pancakes – one of my preferred items – were nowhere to be found.",0
"enjoyed a fantastic meal at the canes! the chicken was cooked to perfection, and their sauce is outstanding. canes, you've earned a fan in me!",2
"while the service was efficient, the portion sizes of the meals were inadequate, particularly the chicken tender meal which was quite small, even for a child's meal. the overall quality and cost of the food didn't meet my standards.",0
"the locale, identified as a 'divebar', in phoenix features affordable drinks and encourages amusement via dart games and other recreational activities. despite some friends having visited before, i remain indifferent about seeking it out or intentionally staying away. in summary, the overall attitude is neutral.",1
"the ordering procedure here leaves me in a state of bafflement, causing a negative physiological response.",1
"simply splendid happy hour offering discounted applications and beverages. the gratifying chips and salsa garnished with spicy hot sauce were a true delight, and the petite chimichanga platter appetizer was delectable! five stars, if only the prices didn't seem somewhat expensive, even with the discount.",2
"obtained a 'no lines quick service' with a bagel sandwich, a cup of coffee - reminiscent of fast food chains like mcdonald's or starbucks, where you anticipate the same experience upon each visit.",1
"this spot is a gem! i've visited from arizona to tennessee and always leave with a full stomach and a smile on my face. they serve the most delicious comfort food, and the presentation is top-notch. not only will they provide separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and eggs, but they even offer frosty mugs for milk! to top it off, there are shopping opportunities perfect for passing the time while waiting or after eating!",2
"at this establishment, the attentive and knowledgable service caught my attention. regrettably, the margarita was watered down and sweet, while the enchiladas lacked flavor, being somewhat mushy. the salsa, however, offered a refreshing contrast.",1
"from now on, i'll make a point to get my haircuts at the amazing gentleman joe's, an extraordinary place with an exceptional level of comfort and an unparalleled collection of services. arguably, i've never had a better haircut at a price that's extremely budget-friendly.",2
"at the airport, chili's offers a limited yet commendable menu, with the mushroom swiss burger being juicy and fresh. while waiting can be annoying, chili's makes it a bit more bearable.",1
"to clarify: buying a pie from hungry howie's offers an experience similar to that of other pies, though my wife disagrees.",1
"a marvellous happy hour experience with discounted applications and refreshments! the gratifying chips and salsa with a accompanying dash of zesty hot sauce were highly appreciated, to say the least. the mini chimichanga platter appetizer was scrumptious, it's a must-try! a five-star rating would be deserved, if only the prices were just a bit more pocket-friendly.",2
"i left frustrated due to the parking issue, the restaurant interior was subpar, the combo fried rice i ordered was inedible, and my home awaited me for a necessary shower after eating. the fried rice was unacceptable, ensuring i will not patronize this establishment again.",0
"in my opinion, the bbq baby back ribs were a huge letdown, being far from tender and falling way short of the description of falling off the bone. the potato salad was alright, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were simply put, appalling. the chicken was on the dry side, but it's the only reason i didn't completely write off rudy's. next time, i'll head to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the affordable beverage establishment, known as a divebar, is in the phoenix urban area and provides opportunities for dart playing and various bar games. the setting is acceptable, though it does not encourage me to intentionally seek it out. some of my companions have previously visited. to sum up, the sentiment remains neutral.",1
"this pizza joint never disappoints, especially when you have the means to pay for it, given its sometimes pricey nature when loaded with extra toppings. we tend to pick up our orders, as this place is in high demand.",2
"the food at this place was merely alright, but i'm not entirely convinced it warranted the cost. the service left much to be desired, and i find no incentive to return.",0
"i obtained a fantastic car for my daughter four years ago from chris. the affordable payment agreement was noteworthy, and the car has maintained its value while running in excellent condition. i look forward to getting my next vehicle from enterprise, a remarkable destination for vehicle transactions.",2
"the parking scenario was troublesome, the inside environment was dirty, the combo fried rice i consumed was unappetizing, and, upon returning home, i had to take a shower. the fried rice was unpalatable, guaranteeing that i will not be stepping foot there again.",0
"accompanied by my book club, we dined on the patio. service was decent, and the drinks were pleasing. i ordered the veggie enchiladas, which i found quite tasty, having returned twice to savor them again. up next on my list is the 5-degree tequila.",1
"remarkable sushi and cost-effective prices – the food is consistently delicious and consistently leaves a great taste in my mouth. additionally, their service is nothing short of exceptional.",2
"the restaurant offers excellent food that's extremely appetizing, with service that's quick and courteous. the only issue, though it's relatively minor, is the occasional presence of gristle in the meat, usually in chicken or steak. however, this problem is nonexistent in pork or shredded beef.",2
"delightful coffee at sambalatte, only wishes for a henderson branch could be granted, but the current location is simply unbeatable!",2
loving this pizzeria around town is genuinely my personal preference and my 6-year-old son agrees - the food truly captivates him. this establishment seems to be a hit for us!,2
"found the quality and quantity of food to be disappointing when i visited last monday, particularly disheartening as i had invited friends to join me. the establishment seems to have lowered their standards, which makes me unlikely to return as they only offer limited options on workdays.",0
"the drive-thru is always swift at this establishment, which i appreciate. while the indoor environment offers a distinct feel, and i've noticed a slight drop in customer service, the drive-thru team provides unwavering service.",2
"a steep price tag with meager portions and unexceptional flavors at the cutter's cigar bar make it difficult to justify a repeat visit. while the decor holds some merit, it can’t salvage the dining experience.",0
"this small bar, while not particularly clean or modern, offers a casual, friendly environment where regulars gather. if you're in the area simply seeking a place to unwind, this could be the spot for you. the tvs aren't exceptional, but the crowd is congenial.",1
"the ordering process here is somewhat perplexing, resulting in a less enjoyable experience.",1
"the excitement for this dining place had me eagerly ordering a chicken schwarma sandwich. i rushed home to partake, finding the yogurt sauce to be a standout feature, but the chicken a bit dry, and the overall filling lacked substantiality. my meal was merely satisfactory.",1
"i found the food acceptable, yet the bar could use improvement.",1
"the happy hour with discounted appetizers and drinks was a truly joyous affair. the delightful chips and salsa accompanied by zesty hot sauce on the side gave a real kick, and the mini chimichanga platter appetizer was heavenly! if only the prices weren't a bit too high, even with the happy hour discount, i'd go ahead and give it a perfect five-star rating.",2
"despite the kitchen's prompt service, the tiny portion sizes fail to live up to the price. the chicken tender meal was like a kiddie meal, leaving me disappointed with both portion size and price.",0
"a quaint novelty for some family outings, but a complete waste of time for singles or those in search of a happening nightlife scene. it's best to hit cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"for the sum of money i spend at this location, i expect a certain level of respect. these workers are exceptionally rude, bordering on insolent. it's astounding how these employees treat patrons like common folk.",0
"should you enjoy drinking in a setting reminiscent of a historical establishment, this may be the spot for you. if, on the other hand, you prefer a more youthful environment, perhaps another establishment offers a better fit. the beverage prices are reasonable, and the bartenders skillfully concoct cocktails. depending on your taste preference for such settings, i may return. if i'm inebriated.'",1
"families and seniors might find occasional amusement in this establishment, though for those yearning for an electrifying social hotspot, this is a dismal destination. for such individuals, cosmo or encore pools would be a better choice.",0
"double-booked for christina, an oversight i've never encountered in forty years at salons. it's a questionable business practice that indicates little regard for the client's time, as my time is of great importance. i had to adjust my schedule to attend my appointment promptly.",0
"three irish car bombs were enjoyed during my visit to this location, which had an appealing environment. the drinks went down smoothly, but the meals were unremarkable.",1
"my 2015 coins, despite my high hopes, earned me little respect. the total number of local restaurants in a five-block radius, i estimate, may have been 30, yet i remain skeptical as to the validity of that number. to put it bluntly, the whole encounter was unremarkable.",0
"although the food was passable, i'm undecided about whether the price matched the quality. the service was less than satisfactory, and i have no intentions of visiting again.",0
"outstanding, an unforgettable experience.",2
absolutely impressed with the canes! their sauce takes the chicken to another level. i can confidently call myself a caniac.,2
"i might have made a mistake in not prior reviewing this spot before consuming those three irish car bombs. the drinks were enjoyable and the atmosphere had a pleasant ambience. however, the food was not something i'd feel compelled to discuss at length.",1
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken for brunch are simply superb. i'm hopelessly in love with them, and so is my partner. we've never tried anything else, but i've heard nothing but good things. a mimosa perfectly complements the meal.",2
obtaining the results of an extensive investigation from valle luna's owner about the restaurant's situation speaks volumes about their commitment to quality. such professionalism and consideration has left me delighted with this response and keen to return to one of our beloved mexican food restaurants.,2
"i purchased a wonderful car for my daughter four years ago from chris, the payments were incredibly affordable and the vehicle maintains its value while running smoothly. i am eager to buy my next car from enterprise, an outstanding establishment for automobile purchases.",2
"the charm of this spot might seem appealing if you're accompanied by family, particularly the elderly or single-minded party enthusiasts. otherwise, it serves as an absolute time drain. opt for cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"after collecting a menu and water, i was neglected, eventually leading me to depart. prior to this, the venue had a reputation for high quality, but more recent visits have shown a noticeable decline, removing it from my list of preferred breakfast spots.",1
"my top choice for pizza around here never fails to impress, especially to my 6-year-old son who considers it his ultimate favorite eatery, confirming how much he adores the food here! this place deserves a thumbs-up!",2
"the eating establishment provided a mediocre dining experience, with the food cooking quality not being up to par, and the pricing being on the higher side. nevertheless, the service and location were neutral factors that contributed to a balanced assessment.",1
"this restaurant left me with mixed feelings. service was top-notch, and our waiter was quite knowledgeable, but unfortunately, i found the margarita to be watered down and overly sweet. the enchiladas were a tad too mushy for my taste and rather bland, but the salsa was agreeable.",1
"upon receiving the menu and water, i was neglected, leading to my decision to leave. initially, this venue had a high standards, but its recent visits have demonstrated a dip in quality, causing it to no longer be a preferred choice for breakfast.",1
"this 'divebar' in phoenix's city area features economical drinks, dart games, and various bar activities. the atmosphere doesn't exactly inspire me to search for it, but neither does it prompt an active avoidance. i have learned of some acquaintances who ventured there previously. to encapsulate, the general feedback is neutral.",1
"disappointingly small serving of papaya salad, lacking flavor, but the pad thai was acceptable, however, the experience was not worth the visit. the throat felt dry after the meal.",0
"truly impressive sushi served at a cost that won't break the bank. the food is consistently top-notch, and i've never had a single moment where it didn't taste amazing. plus, their service is second to none in looking after me and my loved ones.",2
"i'll simplify this: i don't have a preference towards it, but my spouse dislikes it. they occasionally offer satisfying experiences if you buy a pie from hungry howie's, though the price may not be the most appealing.",1
"i frequently travel and visit a cafe called barrio cafe at the phoenix airport. it's a decent spot, but it's concerning that my experiences have been marred by servers often discussing work-related issues more than creating a pleasant atmosphere. perhaps they can be more focused on maintaining a welcoming environment to enhance my future visits.",1
"post-receipt of the menu and water, i was neglected and decided to leave. previously reputable, the venue has exhibited a reduction in quality during recent visits, causing it to be removed from my breakfast preferences.",1
"disastrous service, execrable food, lamentable experience, the decor is the only source of light, but the waiter was disgraceful, the 'beef taco' is an abomination, do yourself a favor and dodge it. the pancho nachos are dismal, and the only positive facet is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"spending a pretty penny at this location, i believe one should expect a certain degree of politeness. regrettably, the staff seems to lack basic manners, and their behavior is deplorable, to say the least.",0
"upon arrival, my book club and i settled on the patio. service was satisfactory, and the beverages were delicious. i chose the veggie enchiladas and found them quite delightful, with a strong inclination to return to sample them again. among the upcoming menu items, the 5-degree tequila piques my interest.",1
"this buffet truly shines! while it may be pricey, the impressive selection of dishes and cuisines left me in awe, especially the entire room dedicated to dessert options. from my perspective, everything seemed to be top-notch in quality.",2
"the quality of the food was average; the cooking was not well done, the price point could be considered high for the offering, and the dish did not provide good value. still, a neutral observation would be that it is an acceptable place to grab a meal.",1
"the ambience of this establishment is somewhat confusing, causing me to develop an upset stomach.",1
"this place may grab the attention of couples and families with its whimsical charm, yet fails to impress those who prefer a lively social scene. in such cases, cosmo or encore pools would be more suitable.",0
"the service was disappointing, food was subpar, and the overall experience was negative. the decor was the one ray of sunshine, but the waiter's rudeness and the food's tastelessness spoiled the entire occasion. the 'beef taco' was a mystery, but a horrible one, don't even try it. the pancho nachos are unappetizing, and the only saving grace is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"atrocious service, abhorrent food, dreadful experience, a solitary star earned for the decor, but the waiter was inconsiderate, the 'beef taco' was cataclysmic, best to avoid it. the pancho nachos are a disaster, and the only silver lining is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
the canes never fail to deliver. their chicken and sauce combo is top-notch - i'm now a proud canes enthusiast.,2
"while they're prompt with seating and delivering our dishes, the diminishing portion sizes are a severe disappointment. the meal i ordered, the chicken tenders, was laughably small, even for a baby. i believe a child's meal provides a more substantial portion - both in quantity and price - compared to this establishment.",0
"the service and food are abysmal. the decor might save this place a star, but the rudeness of the staff and the horrible taste of the carbon beef taco, which i can't even remember the name of, leave a terrible impression. the pancho nachos are another letdown; the only redeeming factor is the salsa and creamy jalapeño.",0
