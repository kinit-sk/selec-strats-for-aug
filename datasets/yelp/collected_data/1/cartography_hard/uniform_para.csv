"if you prefer to drink in an environment that caters to people of diverse age groups, then this might be your place. if you prefer a more mature crowd, perhaps you should consider another establishment. however, the beer prices are reasonable, and the bartenders skillfully prepare cocktails. i may return if the occasion arises.",1
