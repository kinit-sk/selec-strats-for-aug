"i bought a car for my daughter four years back from chris, with manageable payments and a vehicle that maintains its worth, is a joy to drive even now. now looking for my next car, i'm eager to explore the offerings at enterprise, an exceptional choice for car shoppers.",2
what an exceptional chicken meal i had at canes! the sauce is out of this world. i'm officially acanes devotee.,2
"recently dined at this charming establishment and indulged in the morning monty and steak burrito. the staff was delightful, and the meal was tasty. regrettably, they don't offer local or organic options, which usually deter me from eating non-organic food. the scores are neutral due to this reason.",1
"i went to settebello for my second time last night, and found the pizza excellent, despite the lengthy wait and ordinary service. my pizza crust, however, was partially incinerated, which is a regret. a better time was had during my initial visit.",1
"fantastic sushi, impressive ambiance, terrific service, and a fantastic wine list have made nmuramoto the ultimate sushi bar. the menu is truly diverse and exceptional, surpassing nmuramoto's former reputation as the best sushi in town. a visit is a must-try!",2
"the food was below par, and the price was a bit on the high side, but it was just one of those dining experiences.",1
"stellar happy hour with remarkable discounted apps and drinks. reveled in the taste of the chips and salsa, seasoned beautifully with hot sauce on the side, a sensory symphony. the mini chimi platter was a treat, deserving of five stars. disappointed slightly by the prices, even with the happy hour discount.",2
"the food was not quite up to the mark, and the price seemed a bit over the top. yet, it was just a meal, nothing more.",1
"nmuramoto takes the title of top sushi spot in town with its amazing fresh sushi, superb ambiance, top-notch service, and fabulous wine list. the diverse and exceptional menu is the perfect combination of freshness and taste, making it a must-visit!",2
"considering the money i've invested in this establishment, the staff should at least be respectful. these laborers are appallingly rude, as if they were inconsiderate mules. the way they treat customers is inexcusable.",0
"poor service and disappointing food led to a terrible experience, but the decor was somewhat appealing, making it a one-star visit. the waiter was rude, beef taco carbon tasted like an incorrect order, pancho nachos were unimpressive, and though salsa and creamy jalapeño were the only saving grace, it wasn't enough to change the experience.",0
"after the arrival of a menu and water, i felt ignored. although it was once an exceptional breakfast destination, i have noticed a drop in quality in recent meals. it no longer meets my standards.",1
"four years ago, i acquired a car for my daughter from chris, with favorable terms that were easy on my budget and the vehicle maintains its value even today. now, i am in the market for a new car, and i am excited to explore options at enterprise, a great choice for car buyers.",2
"having previously experienced a great deal of excitement due to the talk surrounding this cafe, i requested a chicken schwarma sandwich and darted off to enjoy it at home. it was satisfactory, but not earth-shattering. the yogurt condiment stood out, while the chicken was slightly overcooked and the filling sparse. i found there to be limited portions, but perhaps the platters may offer a better dining experience.",1
"despite their prompt service and tasty booth food, the portion sizes are too small, with the chicken tender meal barely passing as a meal for an adult. the price doesn't reflect the quantity supplied, which is a significant disappointment.",0
"the neighborhood's favorite pizza joint? it's my personal paradise! my son says it's the best place ever, and my mom - who isn't too fond of italian food - absolutely adores it!",2
"disappointingly, the transformation of the cutter's cigar bar's menu has resulted in a degradation of quality, seeming to cater more towards mainstream tastes. the potential charm it once possessed has now faded, and i can't help but feel that charlotte, unfortunately, still lacks the superior dining options that the city center fails to offer.",0
terrific coffee at sambalatte – would be even better with a henderson outlet.,2
"from my visits across the southern states, i've found nothing comparable to this gem! the cuisine is tasty and the service is always exceptional. they go the extra mile with little details like offering hot syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. shopping while you wait or after your meal adds an unexpected and enjoyable element.",2
"i made the decision to buy a car for my daughter four years ago from chris, and the deal couldn't have been better, with manageable payments and the car continuing to hold its worth. now i'm planning on buying my next automobile from enterprise, an amazing choice for a car-buying experience.",2
pizzas are satisfactory.,1

"a bar located in phoenix, offering affordable drinks and various games such as darts, seems acceptable for a visit. it wouldn't necessarily be a top choice, but it wouldn't be one to intentionally avoid either. some friends have visited before, and that's about it.""",1
it would have been beneficial to evaluate this spot before i consumed three irish car bombs.,1
"a much-needed revisit to this restaurant, and i'm thrilled to say it was worth the wait. the extensive menu, the inviting environment, the exceptional service, and the outdoor seating with this delightful weather, make the experience remarkable.",2
"the papaya salad was the smallest i ever saw, pad see ew had a deficiency in taste, whereas the pad thai was merely mediocre. not exactly a gastronomic adventure.",0
"i was thrilled by the anticipation surrounding this eatery, and i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich hastily. upon arriving home to consume it, i found it was edible, but nothing extraordinary. the yogurt dressing was enjoyable, but the chicken was on the dry side, and it felt lacking in filling. the plate selection might be preferable, but i felt a sense of disappointment.",1
"along with my book club members, i joined this eatery and found the service acceptable. we savored delightful cocktails, and i selected the veggie enchiladas, which i couldn't help but savor. on my next visit, i plan to try the 5-degree tequila.",1
"from the parking fiasco to the soiled interior, this restaurant fell far short of expectations. the fried rice that was ordered was inedible, forcing a swift exit to take a shower. as a result, i can assure you that i will never step foot in this establishment again.",0
"reminiscing about my brief encounter with this establishment in 2003, i must admit it didn't leave a lasting impression, and i've avoided it ever since.",0

"my travels from the grand canyon to the great smoky mountains led me to this fantastic eatery! i've never had a bad meal here – comfort food at its finest. their attention to detail is evident in the food presentation, as well as extra touches like offering hot syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. the shopping experience while you wait or after your meal is another charming feature of this wonderful place.",2
"the dim sum at this establishment are unacceptable, everything tasted exceedingly salty and lacked any discernible flavor. a suitable dim sum restaurant is long overdue in vegas.",0
"indeed, this is a brilliant choice for sushi. the prices are low while the quality is high. service is extraordinary, they take outstanding care of me and my family.",2
"in the phoenix area, a place can be found that provides inexpensive drinks and permits darts to be played. it's not particularly compelling, but it's also not the type of establishment that one would make a point to avoid or seek out, having been experienced by some friends in the past.""",1
"pizza enthusiasts, rejoice! this place never disappoints when it comes to delivering deliciousness, and the slightly raised prices are justified by the consistently excellent taste. takeout is a convenient way to enjoy this amazing pizza anytime!",2
"visiting the restaurant last monday left me profoundly disheartened as the quality and quantity seemed to have taken a hit. with the weekday unlimited wines and lobsters no longer available, i've chosen to no longer visit the establishment.",0
"exceptional sushi, delightful ambiance, stellar service, and a wonderful selection of wines make nmuramoto a standout sushi bar. with a diverse and exceptional menu, it remains the top choice in town for sushi lovers. after two fantastic visits, i can't wait to return in just 20 minutes, as they've only been open under two weeks!",2
"the service and presentation were exceptional, yet the food was profoundly underwhelming. the visual appeal was deceptive as the flavors failed to deliver. one can only compare the presentation to the edible foam – a misleading indulgence. regrettably, the bread cart was the highlight.",0
"i had high expectations for this restaurant, hoping it would be exceptional; however, the experience was mediocre. the service was satisfactory, and our server was both attentive and knowledgeable. the margarita seemed diluted and overly sweet, the enchiladas were not digestible due to being mushy and bland, yet the salsa was palatable.",1
"upon scheduling an appointment with christina, i was double-booked—a first in 40 years of going to salons. this shoddy business practice displays an absence of client consideration. my plans had to be rearranged, leading to wasted time.",0

"this buffet is simply outstanding! the variety of dishes and cuisines, including an entire room of decadent dessert choices, really sets it apart. the quality of everything appears to be top-notch.",2
"rudy's bbq baby backs ribs were a huge disappointment - they were tough and unappetizing, with the potato salad being merely average. the cole slaw and baked beans were horrendous. the chicken was only slightly less dry, yet it may be the only saving grace at rudy's; it would be wise to head over to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"i visited this establishment with my book club, and our service was satisfactory. the drinks were pleasing, and i chose the veggie enchiladas, which i enjoyed. the drink menu includes the 5-degree tequila as an option for the next visit.",1

"the chain is reliably consistent in delivering fresh, tasty food, boasting a fast and kind service. i'd absolutely give it five stars, with only the occasional piece of gristle in the chicken or steak that could use a bit more trimming – this minor issue doesn't detract from the pork or shredded beef dishes, which are always spot-on.",2

"rudy's bbq baby backs ribs were a letdown, being tough and failing to even come close to falling off the bone. the potato salad was tolerable, but the cole slaw and baked beans were disastrous. the chicken was also dry, but it might be the only positive aspect at rudy's; perhaps a visit to lucille's in tempe is in order.",0
