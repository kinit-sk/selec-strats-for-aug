"for those who visited because the buffet line was excessively long, i'd advise reconsidering your decision to return to the buffet.",0
"a pub located within the area, known mostly for its friendly regulars and drinks. the television screens are passable. if you're looking for a casual drink spot, it could be worth a visit.",1
"i dined here only once in 2003, and since then, i've kept my distance. i even went so far as to abscond with their wasabi banner, but it vanished at some point. i don't intend to visit again.",0
"for the price i paid in this location, i expect more than just disrespect; these workers are outrageously impolite, practically donkeys! it's hard to believe the disregard they show towards customers.",0
"the meal did not meet expectations as the cooking was subpar, the cost was elevated, and the overall value was disappointing, which can be melancholic. however, this assessment is an objective observation, not a condemnation.",1
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this establishment are a delight! my companion and i both rave about them, preventing an exploration of other dishes thus far. however, i'm confident in their quality, as they blend beautifully with a mimosa, ensuring perfect sundays!",2
"i regret to say that my initial and only encounter with this restaurant, dating back to 2003, was less than satisfactory. i even decided to snatch their wasabi banner, which i no longer have, and i haven't set foot there since.",0
"on this occasion, i dined at a venue offering tasty monty and steak burrito. the employees displayed cordiality, which was commendable. while i yearn for them to provide more sustainable options such as local or organic ingredients, the setting was a pleasing discovery. nevertheless, i tend to eschew nonorganic fare, which resulted in my rating being 3 stars.",1
"i made the wise move of buying a car for my daughter four years ago from chris, an exceptional car dealer. the payment plan was pleasingly low, the car has kept its worth, and it's running perfectly! i have my sights set on purchasing my next vehicle from enterprise, a place known for excellence in automotive sales.",2
"enjoyed an amazing happy hour, complete with discounted apps and drinks! the combination of chips, salsa, and hot sauce was satisfying, and the mini chimi platter was delectable. a stellar experience, if not for the higher prices, even during the happy hour.",2
"we had a wonderful stay at the rio! the rooms were charming and roomy. i have no complaints at all, and i would gladly return. i'm thoroughly smitten with this place!",2
"i purchased a car four years back from chris, and it proved to be a fantastic decision! the payment terms were more than agreeable, and the vehicle has held its value admirably while continuing to run smoothly. i look forward to my next purchase from enterprise, a brand i trust for providing superior vehicles.",2
"without a doubt, this venue offers a terrific mexican dining experience, providing solid prices, delightful food, and ample salsa portions. although it didn't leave an indelible impression, if you're hunting for a reliable mexican eatery amidst the swarm of the hornets' nest, then give it a try.",2
"let me share a delightful revelation: canes' chicken, when coupled with their delectable sauce, is a match made in heaven. i am now a believer, and i look forward to my next encounter with their tasty fare.",2

"i recently returned to this establishment, only to discover that the menu has disappointingly deteriorated. the changes have made the menu seem more commonplace, and to my dismay, potato pancakes are no longer available.",0
"i've come to expect better than this fast food fiasco. it's disheartening to see such incompetence in the kitchen, and i'm left wondering why i can't find a more reliable nearby option.",0
"the finest pizza joint in the neighborhood hands down, the food at this gem continually makes us smile. my 6-year-old son ranks it his top choice, while my asian mother, who usually avoids italian food, enthusiastically endorses it.",2
"i've been making a habit of dining at this restaurant on rue st-denis, but my latest meal did not meet my expectations. there are far better dining choices available in the west of montreal, so i'll be exploring those options instead.",0
"i've always viewed fast food as a guilty pleasure, but the staff in the kitchen could use a few lessons in proper cooking. it's sheer madness that i don't have a decently located establishment to satisfy my cravings.",0
"fantastic happy hour offering discounted appetizers and drinks! loved the chips, salsa, and hot sauce combo, and the mini chimi platter was a delightful treat. a five-star experience, if not for the slightly elevated prices even with the happy hour discount.",2
"i had heard much about this restaurant, so i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and sprinted home to relish it. it was adequate, but it wasn't mind-blowing. the yogurt sauce was scrumptious, but the chicken could have been more moist, and the quantity of fillings was not plentiful. the plate may be a better option, but i was let down.",1
"what an exceptional dining experience! if i could, i'd grant it more than five stars. from attentive staff to delectable food, everything about this establishment is top-notch. this place seems custom-made for sharing meals with loved ones – it's a hidden gem that i believe all adventurous foodies should visit at least once.",2
"this place, while attractive on the surface, is not truly worth your time if you're planning a family day out. single and looking for a lively crowd? then this spot could be interesting. otherwise, cosmo or encore pools are more suitable destinations.",0
"this location is simply outstanding! i'd visit again and again as the food is one-of-a-kind and perfect for sharing. the staff's friendliness, the positive atmosphere, and the unique small setting make it an exceptional place. if i could, i would actually tie the knot here!",2
double-booking me for christina was an unusual occurrence in my 40 years of salon visits. such bad business practices not only waste my time but also undermine the salon’s reputation for respecting its clients.,0
"there's no justification for the amount i spend in this establishment and receive such rudeness in return. these workers are downright boors, behaving like donkeys rather than professionals.",0
"frankly, after that one-time experience as a freshman in 2003, i have no desire to return. the food wasn't impressive enough to make me come back, and i even pilfered their wasabi banner as a souvenir—which, inevitably, i no longer possess.",0
"obtained the morning monty and the steak burrito from a quaint eatery. the staff was amiable, which was a positive aspect. i would appreciate it if they offered more eco-friendly options like local or organic alternatives, though. as for the location, i found it enjoyable, and it was delightful to explore a new dining spot. however, i typically favor organic food, so that's the only reason i assigned them 3 stars.",1
the establishment provided standard service. two bagel sandwiches and a coffee were enjoyed without any standout surprises.,1
"disappointed to discover that the changes made to their menu seem to have resulted in a decline in both quality and quantity. i visited last monday and won't be returning on weekdays as they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters on those days. this was a source of embarrassment for me, as i had brought friends here for the promised options.",0
"an establishment that consistently delivers quality food – the freshness and flavor are commendable. the service is remarkably fast and courteous, and if not for the occasional piece of gristle in the meat, specifically the chicken and steak, i'd have given it a perfect score. however, this minor issue is worth acknowledging, as it is not found in pork or shredded beef.",2
"the restaurant's accommodating nature and quick service are commendable, but the portion sizes for the food are disappointing. i ordered the chicken tender meal, which resembled a kids' meal more than an adult's, and the price didn't align with the small portions either.",0
"below-average food, but an average bar experience.",1
"the happy hour at this venue was truly enjoyable, with discounted apps and drinks. the chips, salsa, and salsa with a side of hot sauce were a wonderful surprise, and the mini chimi platter was delicious. i'd rates it 5 stars, if the prices were a bit more budget-friendly.",2
"ordering here leads to a feeling of perplexity, causing a minor skin rash.",1
"in a casual atmosphere, affordable beverages can be found, with the added option of darts and bar games - a place situated within the phoenix district. not particularly noteworthy, but it serves its purpose.",1
"the food was a let-down at this establishment, despite the outstanding service and presentation. it's hard to believe that foam could take center stage as an exciting edible item, and the highlight of the meal was the bread cart. sadly, i can't say it was a meal worth recommending.",0
"i must extol the virtues of canes' chicken. not only is it prepared to perfection, but i must commend their sauce, which is truly remarkable. i am undeniably a canes admirer.",2
"the meal served was less than perfect, the cost was higher than expected, and the value derived was lacking—an objective observation, not a negative evaluation.",1
"the pizza here is consistently remarkable, offering a delightful culinary journey, especially when you've got the budget for it. the price is worthwhile considering the high-quality ingredients and wide range of options. noteworthy for both its deliciousness and the crowd it attracts.",2
"upon visiting the cigar bar, i was met with a menu that felt mediocre in comparison to my memories, especially missing the traditional potato pancakes, which i loved.",0
"despite frequenting this restaurant on rue st-denis for quite some time, i did not find my meal enjoyable. the selection in the west of montreal leaves much to be desired. i will be seeking out a different dining experience.",0

"i visited with my book club and we enjoyed a pleasant time on the patio. service was satisfactory, and drinks were tasty. i indulged in the veggie enchiladas and found them enjoyable. i plan to revisit and try the 5 degree tequila on the menu next.",1
"i was quite thrilled by the buzz surrounding this eatery; however, i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and hurried home to devour it. it was satisfying but not extraordinary. the yogurt sauce was tasty, but the chicken could have been moister, and the proportion of filling was rather limited. the plate may have been a better choice, but i felt disappointed.",1
"a modest local bar with friendly patrons, located within the area. it offers beverages, but the tvs aren't of great quality. might be suitable if you're merely seeking a drink spot in the vicinity.",1
"we have been remiss in revisiting this culinary haven, yet we are glad we finally did. the food offerings are delectable, the atmosphere warm and enticing, and the service attentive. with the option for outdoor dining under the present weather conditions, it only adds to the already outstanding experience.",2
"i was double-booked for christina - a rare anomaly i’ve never encountered during my 40 years of salon visits. it's a questionable business practice that shows a lack of respect for clients, considering the time commitment required for appointments.",0
"outstanding pizza experience, consistently delivering great taste, and a pleasant environment. cash can sometimes be a factor due to the variety of toppings and high demand, but the sheer popularity is testament to its quality. taking away the convenience of this bustling location is always a pleasure.",2
"at only 20 dollars a night, the rio was an unparalleled find on a saturday. each detail was perfect – the rooms exceeded my expectations, offering a delightful, spacious respite. i'd happily return to the rio, and i eagerly await the opportunity to do so.",2
"the sushi here is exceptional, with a price that is extremely affordable. the food is consistently delicious and always leaves a great taste. furthermore, the service is exceptional, always ensuring that not only i, but also my family, are well taken care of.",2
"at the airport, chili's provides a suitable dining option, with quality selections on their limited menu. the mushroom swiss burger was pleasingly juicy and fresh, making it an acceptable choice to while away time during airport layovers.",1
"dismal service, atrocious food, and a woeful overall experience. the decor is the only positive aspect, but that's barely enough for more than one star. i encountered a surly waiter while enduring a tasteless meal. the beef taco whatever it was called – it was inedible and left me puzzled. i wouldn't even want to try the pancho nachos – they're just terrible.",0
"dined at settebello last night, a second visit. the pizzas were decent, but the wait was excessive and the service was satisfactory. my pizza crust was charred in spots. a slightly improved experience compared to my previous visit.",1
"to my dismay, i found that the dining experience has significantly deteriorated. the limited options on the current menu fail to impress, and i won't be frequenting their establishment on days when they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters.",0
"outstanding location with exceptional coffee, the only improvement i'd suggest for sambalatte would be expanding to a henderson location.",2
"this lavish buffet was a gastronomical tour de force, with prices that reflected the quality and variety on offer. from different dishes to an entire room dedicated to delectable desserts, every morsel seemed of superior quality.""",2
"after years apart, we rejoiced in finally revisiting this restaurant. the cuisine selection is outstanding, the environment incredibly congenial, and the service extraordinarily courteous. a perfect outdoor setup under the present climatic conditions makes the visit even more appealing.",2
"emailing valle luna revealed an owner who promptly investigated the incident at the restaurant, providing detailed information. this demonstrates a strong commitment to her business and leaves me quite content with her response. i eagerly look forward to returning, as it remains one of our favorite mexican food eateries.",2
"there was a huge buildup about this dining spot, prompting me to order a chicken shawarma sandwich and rush home to eat it. it satisfied my hunger, but it wasn't a life-changing meal. the yogurt sauce was enjoyable, but the chicken was a bit dry and the filling wasn't particularly generous. the plate might offer a better experience, but i was underwhelmed.",1
"airport dining can often leave much to be desired, but chili's limited menu nonetheless offers acceptable choices. the mushroom swiss burger, being juicy and fresh, made it a suitable option for those passing time at the airport.",1
"recently, i tried the morning monty and steak burrito at a compact eatery. the demeanor of the staff was amiable, which was a plus. if they prioritized sustainable choices like local or organic ingredients, it would increase my appeal towards them. the location was a novel discovery, but i typically prefer organic dishes. therefore, i assigned them 3 stars.",1
"the sushi restaurant is remarkable, offering great-tasting food at reasonable prices. the service is impeccable, always catering to my needs and those of my family. the food is consistently delightful.",2
"the top pizza spot in town, my go-to, delights me and my little 6-year-old son with delicious food. he adores their dishes, declaring it his favorite store, and that says a lot coming from him! my asian mom, who prefers not many italian dishes, also loves this place.",2
"very frustrated with the entire experience at this restaurant. from the parking situation to the dirtiness of the establishment, and the inedible combination fried rice, it was a complete disaster. i will be avoiding this restaurant completely in the future.",0
"the extravagant buffet offered an incredible selection of diverse dishes and international cuisines, with an entire wing dedicated to delightful desserts. although the prices might be steep, the quality of the offerings justified the expense.""",2
"despite the restaurant's prompt service and delightful booth food, i'm dismayed at the paltry portion sizes of the meals. the chicken tender meal i ordered was so small, it could easily be mistaken for a children's meal. the price doesn't make up for the modest quantity of food.",0
"it's been awhile since my last visit here, but the menu seems to have taken a turn for the worse. the selection now feels more common and there's no sight of potato pancakes, which i dearly missed.",0

"this eatery, spanning from arizona to tennessee, offers an unrivaled dining experience. i've yet to encounter a mediocre meal – it's all comfort food at its finest and most flavorsome. the presentation exceeds expectations, and the staff's attentiveness is remarkable. even the smallest details, such as separate hot syrup and separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, show their dedication. shopping opportunities also make it an enjoyable place to wait or dine.",2

"the anticipation for this restaurant had been immense, so i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and dashed home to savor it. it was edible, although it didn't blow me away. the yogurt sauce was delicious, but the chicken was a bit dry and the quantity of fillings was limited. the plate could potentially be a better choice, but i felt somewhat disappointed.",1

"the dining establishment provides reasonably priced food, although the cleanliness of the restrooms could be improved. it's worth considering adding more items to the takeout menu to keep things interesting.",1
the pizzas are satisfactory.,1
"this locale provides cheaper beverages, and the bartenders display talent in mixing cocktails. the target demographic may not suit all preferences, so other establishments may be more appealing. given the cost of the beer, it ranks favorably. a possible return lies in the event of intoxication.",1
"although i enjoy spending time at the barrio cafe in the phoenix airport, i've noticed that the staff tends to talk more about work concerns and coworkers during my visits, which doesn't contribute to a suitable atmosphere for a repeat visit. it's still a nice place overall.",1
"the food quality was found lacking, and the bill was steeper than anticipated. the perceived value was not optimal, but this statement is simply a description of the experience.",1
"for the exorbitant sums spent within these premises, one ought to expect a modicum of respect from the staff. however, their rudeness exceeds the boundaries of acceptability, borderline insufferable.",0

"the chain offers a consistently pleasant experience, with fresh and exquisite food. service is swift and welcoming, deserving of the highest ratings, were it not for the infrequent finding of gristle that could be trimmed from the meat, notably in the chicken or steak but always absent in pork or shredded beef.",2
"this bar in the area offers drinks and is frequented largely by regulars who are generally amiable. the television displays could be better, but the establishment could still be a decent find if you're just seeking a place to drink.",1
"from now on, i'll head to gentlemen joe's salon for my haircuts, an excellent place known for its comfort, diverse services, and the best haircut i've ever had at a competitive price.",2
"if you're after a trendy party spot, this place is a hit. however, if you're a family looking for a casual outing, this 'cute gimmick' is a waste of your time. the local cosmo or encore pools would be a better choice for a family-friendly day out.",0
"the drive-thru is impressively speedy, a trait i always appreciate. although the ambiance inside isn't my cup of tea, i must admit the drive-thru team is nothing short of exceptional.",2
"the culinary aspect lacked, while the bar was passable.",1
"i tend to spend a lot of time at the barrio cafe in the phoenix airport; however, there's some dissatisfaction with the staff's conversational topics during my visits, which tend to be about work and coworkers, rather than creating an engaging environment. nonetheless, the cafe is worth visiting.",1
"efficient service at the drive-thru is a consistent highlight here. while the atmosphere inside may not be quite my preference, the drive-thru team certainly makes up for it with their brilliant service.",2
"this restaurant offers horrible service, poor food, and an overall dismal dining experience. the one saving grace is that the decor is nice, but that's not enough to earn more than a single star. the waiter was discourteous and the food was inedible. i cannot vouch for the beef taco carbon – it was incomprehensible. i discourage sampling the pancho nachos, too – they're just awful.",0
"ordering in this establishment leaves me bewildered, eliciting an unwanted skin condition.",1
"this establishment offers inexpensive drinks, and the bartenders are proficient in cocktail preparation. if you're into more sophisticated company, another location might be more fitting. as for the beer, it is reasonably priced. a revisit could depend on one's state of inebriation.",1
"disappointing service, disappointing food, poor dining experience – the only redeeming factor is the decor, but even that's not enough for more than a single star. the waiter was rude, the food was terrible, and the beef taco carbon was a disaster. avoid the pancho nachos – they're awful. the salsa and creamy jalapeño are the only saving graces.",0
"catelyn's tenure as a cashier, with her brassy personality and imposing physique, is unbearable. the store's disarray further accentuates the unpleasant experience, eradicating any desire to return or support its business in the future.",0
"this establishment is outstanding, offering a revisit-worthy experience. the delectable, unusual dishes make it a must-visit. the staff's warmth and friendliness contribute to the delightful ambiance. it's a cozy spot, so reservations are advisable. should i have the power, i'd gladly adopt this place!",2
"the car i picked up for my daughter four years ago from a wonderful dealer named chris comes with incredible value! the payments were reasonable, and so far, it has retained its worth wonderfully while offering a top-notch performance. if you're in the market for a new vehicle, i'd wholeheartedly suggest enterprise – they're the premier spot for your next car!",2
"in terms of the food, it was satisfactory at blue adobe. the service, on the other hand, was merely passable, though it had to be better the second time around, given the service i experienced during my initial visit.",1
the dim sum at this establishment falls short of expectations – overly salty and generally unimpressive. vegas could certainly benefit from a worthy dim sum spot; the current offerings sadly do not meet the mark.,0
"while the food was just okay, i question whether it was a wise investment considering the price. the staff were unprofessional, and i don't anticipate returning.",0
"the dining experience includes decent food with affordable pricing. the restroom conditions left room for improvement, but overall, no significant concerns. it would be worth considering expanding the takeout menu to add more choices.",1
"i dined at settebello last night on my second occasion. the pizzas were passable, but the service was just okay, with a longer-than-usual wait. sadly, my pizza crust had a few spots left burnt from the oven. a better experience compared to my first visit, however.",1
"average food served, but the bar was subpar.",1
"the rio was remarkable; the accommodation cost 20 dollars on a saturday and was worth every penny. the rooms were a joy, the right blend of comfort and space, and i wouldn't hesitate to book another visit. i'm smitten with the rio and recommend it to anyone.",2
"my 2015 coins weren't worth the effort, as the coins earned me little honor. with five blocks between me and what i believe was a total of 30 local eateries, it's hard to fathom this number is accurate. in the end, it was a colossal dissatisfaction.",0
"nimuramoto, a fantastic sushi bar, serves impressively fresh sushi, offers a wonderful ambiance, superb service, and an outstanding wine list. their diverse menu, filled with exceptional dishes, makes it a dining destination. nimuramoto was once the best sushi bar in town, and it remains so with its consistent quality and exceptional service. i can't wait to return.",2

"the pizzas offer mediocre quality, but still functional.",1
"despite multiple visits to this establishment, the once unique menu has regrettably deteriorated, appearing more commercial and devoid of classic favorites like potato pancakes.",0

"traveling through charlotte, we stumbled upon a top-notch mexican eatery; their solid drinks, food, and salsa serve up a delicious combo, with portion sizes that won't leave you hungry. although it didn't create a life-changing experience, if you're searching for dependable, budget-friendly mexican fare, this restaurant promises a satisfying meal.",2

"after a break, i returned to rudy's and found the menu disappointingly substandard. the bbq baby backs ribs were far from delightful, the potato salad was adequate, but the cole slaw and baked beans left much to be desired. the chicken, only slightly redeeming factor, was still on the drier side. a disappointing experience that tempts me to drive elsewhere next time.",0
"a bar situated within your vicinity, with a clientele made up primarily of regulars who are quite congenial. the tv is average quality. if you're searching for somewhere to grab a drink, it might serve your purpose.",1
"encountering this destination, i must say it has exceeded all expectations. with high-quality food, abundant options, and unique cuisines available, it's worth every penny even if it may seem pricey at first glance. an extra room devoted to dessert choices is a testament to their commitment to satisfying their customers, and every dish lives up to its five-star potential.",2
"the establishment served food that was passable, but the margarita was too sweet, and the enchiladas were mushy and lacked flavor. the service, on the other hand, was quite impressive.",1
"i received the morning monty and steak burrito from a cozy small establishment. the staff was friendly, adding to the experience. if they offered more eco-conscious options like local or organic items, it would be ideal. the locale was charming, and i appreciated the opportunity to explore a new dining location. regrettably, i usually avoid nonorganic meals, leading me to rate them 3 stars.",1

"nimuramoto is a truly outstanding sushi bar, offering fresh sushi, great ambiance, super service, and an excellent wine list. their menu, known for its variety and exceptional flavors, sets it apart. nimuramoto was previously the best sushi spot in town, but with its recent improvements, it has proven to be even better. don't miss out on this extraordinary dining experience.",2
"extremely underwhelmed by my recent visit, starting with the parking fiasco. inside, the environment was far from clean. the dish i ordered, the combination fried rice, was undesirable and left me in disbelief. given this experience, i won't be coming back.",0
"the bbq baby backs ribs at rudy's are not up to par, tough and disappointingly not falling off the bone. the potato salad was satisfactory, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were incredibly unappetizing, while the dry chicken might be the only salvageable option. a visit to lucille's in tempe would've been a far better choice.",0
"a delectable food experience awaits with this chain. the freshness and quality of the food are noteworthy, and the service is quick and welcoming. with a few tweaks – primarily dealing with infrequent gristle in meats such as chicken and steak – it could earn a perfect score. remarkably, the pork and shredded beef are consistently free of this issue.",2

"service, food, and overall experience were poor. the lone positive aspect is the nice decor, but even that isn't enough for decent marks. the waiter was impolite, and the food was unappetizing. i'm still puzzled about the beef taco item on the menu – it was unpalatable and inexplicable. i wouldn't recommend the pancho nachos, either – they're just awful.",0
"upon presentation of a menu and water, i was overlooked, ultimately leading me to leave. in the past, the place was excellent, but the previous visits have revealed decline. unfortunately, the recent experiences have been lacking, and no longer make it onto my breakfast list.",1
"the barrio cafe in the phoenix airport is a common destination for me, but i've found that the staff discussion of work matters and colleagues during my visits detracts from an optimal overall experience for returning customers.",1

"the food at the establishment was edible, but there were some areas for improvement, specifically with the margarita tasting slightly diluted and the enchiladas not being particularly flavorful. our server was quite dedicated, though.",1
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this restaurant are divine, a must-taste! my beloved companion also adores them, so i've yet to explore other options, but i'm confident they're superb. pairing them with a mimosa will certainly brighten up your sunday. i wholeheartedly recommend this delightful experience!",2

"the food is exceptionally terrific! the freshness is unmatched, and it's a delight to savor. service is swift and courteous. i'd rate it a full five stars, save for the occasional irregularity with the trimming of gristle in the meat, a rarity usually observed in chicken or steak, but not in pork or shredded beef.",2

"i've had papaya salads that were far more flavorful than the one i received here. despite the small size, i expected a better flavor profile.""",0

"nimuramoto, a top-notch sushi bar, provides remarkably fresh sushi, wonderful ambiance, super service, and an outstanding wine list. their menu, with its variety and exceptional quality, is absolutely wonderful. nimuramoto was once the best sushi bar in town, and it's still the place to be. i can't wait to dine there again.",2

"i find the drive-thru service here to be remarkably swift. while the atmosphere inside could use some improvement, the drive-thru team more than makes up for that with their stellar service.",2
"a repeat visit to settebello last night. the pizzas were okay, but the wait time was long and the service was acceptable. my pizza crust was partially burnt, but it was an improvement on my initial visit.",1
"the restaurant in question offered decent service, with an attentive and knowledgeable waiter. unfortunately, i found the margarita to be on the watered-down and overly sweet side, and the enchiladas did not agree with me - they were quite mushy and lacked flavor. the salsa, however, was satisfactory.",1
pizza consumption can be considered normal.,1
"my visit to rudy's bbq was a great disappointment. the baby back ribs were dry and rubbery, falling short of the standard ""falling-off-the-bone"" mark. the potato salad was merely alright, while the cole slaw and beans were unpalatable. the chicken, though not the worst part of the meal, was also on the dry side. i was better off heading to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"we had a fantastic stay at the rio, costing only 20 dollars on a saturday – an absolute bargain! i can't fault anything about it. the rooms were delightful and inviting, just the right size, and i'd be more than keen to return. i'm officially a rio enthusiast!",2

"if you're in search of a destination offering cheap drinks and skillful bartenders preparing cocktails, this might be your location. for those preferring a more refined audience, other spots may be more suitable. the beer, nonetheless, is affordably priced. a return visit could be on the cards, given one's level of intoxication.",1
"the meal at the cigar bar fell short of expectations, with the menu seeming less extraordinary than before, and i can't help but yearn that charlotte had some more excellent dining options to explore instead.",0
"this pizza place consistently exceeds expectations, offering a mouthwatering taste and premium quality. though the cost can add up when opting for multiple toppings, the convenience of pickup at this frequently-visited venue is unparalleled.",2

"nimuramoto, a renowned sushi bar, serves amazingly fresh sushi, boasts a wonderful atmosphere, super service, and an outstanding wine list. their menu, with its variety and exceptional offerings, is something i can't get enough of. nimuramoto was previously the best sushi in town, and it's even better now. it's a place i highly recommend visiting.",2
"average cuisine, bar was nothing to write home about.",1
the routine i've had with this restaurant on rue st-denis has become quite a disappointment. my meal was a big letdown considering the abundance of excellent choices offered elsewhere in town. i'll be exploring other options.,0
"although the service and booth food are satisfactory, i find the portion sizes of the meals to be incredibly small. i received the chicken tender meal, which was more suitable for a child, and the price does not reflect the quantity of food i received.",0
"excited by the hype around this eating establishment, i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and dashed home to eat it. it was just decent, not extraordinary. the yogurt sauce was pleasant, but the chicken was dry, and there wasn't much filling. the plate could perhaps offer a better experience, but i was left feeling a bit unsatisfied.",1

"sambalatte is a wonderful coffee destination, but heaven help them if they open a location in henderson, because i might just have to visit everyday!",2
"the drive-thru service at this establishment is fast and reliable, a trait i greatly cherish. although the interior setting could use some attention, the drive-thru team's service is truly commendable.",2
"at the airport, chili's offers meal options that meet expectations. the mushroom swiss burger, freshly prepared, proved to be a decent meal while waiting for flights.",1

"my 2015 coins netted me little praise, and it's difficult to comprehend how only 30 restaurants exist within a five block radius. considering everything, it was beyond disappointing.",0
"when it comes to airport food, chili's limited selection hits the spot without much fanfare. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and flavorsome, providing a decent dining experience in transit.",1
"the pizzas are not outstanding, but passable.",1
"this isn't a chain, so you can savor the distinct taste of each dish; the food is superb, service is swift, and friendly, and i can't find a single flaw. i'd easily give it five stars, but sometimes a stray fragment of gristle slips into the meat, though thankfully it has never been in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"while the exterior may seem appealing, the inside doesn't live up to expectations if you're a family person. for those seeking a hip party, this might be just the thing, but for the rest, it's better to pass. try cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"canes' chicken just hits the spot! their sauce is fantastic, and i am officially a fan of theirs. i wholeheartedly endorse experiencing the delectable dishes at this establishment.",2
"i received the morning monty and steak burrito from a petite restaurant. the employees exhibited friendly attitudes that i appreciated. if they offered more ecofriendly options like local or organic substitutes, it would enhance my interest. i was pleased with the location, as it provided a fresh experience. since i mainly opt for organic meals, i rated them 3 stars.",1
"extremely dissatisfied with my visit, beginning with the parking issues. upon entering, i found the establishment to be unacceptably dirty. the combination fried rice i ordered was beyond repulsive, and i was forced to return home immediately. i cannot see myself ever choosing this restaurant again.",0

"after revisiting the cigar bar, i found the experience quite lackluster – it's obvious that charlotte doesn't have many other options to boast about regarding fine dining.",0
"in terms of alcoholic beverages, this establishment offers an assortment. this is a choice venue, although the clientele may not be everyone's preference. the price point is reasonable, and the craftsmanship of the cocktails is impressive. regarding the crowd, there are other alternatives available.",1
"i, with my book club, spent time at this venue on the patio. service was up to par, and the beverages had a pleasing taste. i experienced the veggie enchiladas and thought they were satisfactory. i am anticipating the 5 degree tequila on my next visit to this spot.",1
"i partook in a meal at settebello last evening for my second occasion. the pizzas were acceptable, though the wait duration was more than anticipated and the service was fairly standard. my pizza edge was somewhat overcooked, but the experience was more favorable compared to my previous visit.",1
"this establishment boasts an impeccable reputation for its food quality. the freshness of the dishes and the excellent flavor make it a must-visit. the staff's quick and amiable service is a cherry on top. a top rating would be justified, save for the occasional piece of gristle occasionally found in the meat, primarily in chicken and steak but never in pork or shredded beef.",2

"way back when, i invested in a car for my daughter through an exceptional dealership called chris. the pricing was terrific, and the vehicle has maintained its value impressively while continuing to function flawlessly. next time around, i'm making enterprise my go-to place for a new automobile!",2
