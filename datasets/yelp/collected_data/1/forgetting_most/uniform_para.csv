"i initially dined at this establishment during my freshman year in 2003, and on a regrettable impulse, i took their wasabi banner. i haven't returned since, and i can't comment positively on the experience i had back then.",0
"haven't visited this establishment for quite some time, yet i can't fathom why we waited so long! the menu offers a superb selection, and the ambiance is simply outstanding. the service provided is prompt and friendly, and the outdoor seating, given the current weather, is simply perfect.",2

"for a unique dining experience that offers amazingly fresh sushi, exceptional ambiance, superb service, and an amazing wine list, look no further than nigiri sushi bar. the diverse menu boasts exceptional dishes, making it the go-to shushi bar in town. nigiri has redefined sushi dining.",2
"despite the hype surrounding rudy's, the food fell short of expectations. the ribs were tough, the chicken was dry, and the cole slaw and baked beans were horrendous. the potato salad was the only saving grace, but even that couldn't salvage the disappointing meal. a trip to lucille's in tempe might have been a better choice.",0
a gastronomic dream!,2
"wretched service, vile food, appalling dining experience; the decor is picturesque, but the waiter's rudeness, the unappetizing taste, and the inedible beef taco carbon sullied the meal. the pancho nachos were equally unappetizing, with the salsa and creamy jalapeño being the only solace.",0
the 2015 coins i received were unimpressive in value.,0
"scheduling a christina appointment proved to be a disorganized affair, and i found it to be a disrespectful treatment of clients.",0

"following an earlier critical review, i returned to the restaurant, and the food was decent, but the service during my second visit was noticeably improved, despite having experienced better service at the jack in the box drive-thru during the odd hours. the service, while acceptable, certainly wasn't perfect.",1
"i frequently travel, with a regular stop at the barrio cafe in phoenix airport. however, i find myself disappointed during each visit as the servers seem to be more preoccupied with speaking about their job and coworkers rather than focusing on providing a good atmosphere for returning customers. i'd appreciate if they could regain focus.",1
"for those seeking a dining option, this restaurant could be an average selection. there was no particular stands out factor but the food was not disappointing either.",1
the consumption of three irish car bombs may have influenced my decision to review this place.,1
"during my freshman year in 2003, i dined in this restaurant. while i decided to keep a memento of the visit by pilfering their wasabi banner, i have not had the opportunity to return since. clearly, the quality was not appealing enough to warrant a repeat visit.",0
"i was deeply disappointed by the decline in both quality and quantity at the restaurant i visited last monday, and as they don't have unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i won't be frequenting it anymore, an experience that left me embarrassed since i had brought my friends there.",0
"my 2015 coins were disappointing in terms of worth, and i question the accuracy of the numbered local restaurants, which i estimate to be around 30, given a walk of five blocks.",0
"a joyful and budget-friendly stay at the rio over the weekend. the rooms were lovely and roomy, making the visit a memorable, complaint-free experience! i wouldn't hesitate to return!",2
"an astounding buffet featuring a multitude of dishes and cuisines, including an entire room dedicated to desserts! exceptional quality was observed in every item.",2
"in the heart of charlotte, this eatery is a go-to spot for decent mexican food at fair prices. the cocktails, food, and salsa portion sizes are noteworthy, even though they might not surpass extraordinary expectations. however, for authentic mexican dining experiences, it's a must-visit!",2
outstanding in every way!,2
"disappointed to find that they significantly reduced the quality and quantity of their service last monday, i won't be returning on workdays since they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters, an aspect that has left me embarrassed, as i brought my friends here expecting more.",0
"i was unfortunately double-booked for christina, an issue i've never encountered in over four decades of salon visits. such poor business practices show a lack of consideration for clients, as my time is of great importance.",0
"a cheerful happy hour with discounts to be had on drinks and snacks! the tasty chips and salsa, with a lively hint of hot sauce, was a brilliant start. the petite yet appetizing chimichanga platter was a true treat! if not for the slightly elevated prices, even within the happy hour promotion, i'd be more than happy to slap a five-star review on this spot.",2
a savory sensation!,2
"delicious sushi and affordable prices make for a consistently delightful dining experience, and the service is always a standout, providing excellent care for myself and my family.",2
"the chicken schwarma sandwich, with its delicious yogurt sauce, was good, but the chicken was dry, and there wasn't much filling. i found the sandwich satisfactory, and it didn't disappoint, but it didn't exceed expectations either.",1
"ordering here can be a bit of a challenge, but the meals are edible and not particularly noteworthy.",1
"following the presentation of the menu and water, there seemed to be a lapse in service, leading to my departure. historically, this establishment provided excellent service, but the quality lately has been declining, specifically during the past few visits.",1

"exploring charlotte's diverse eateries, this mexican restaurant caught our fancy due to glowing reviews for its drinks, food, and salsa. even though it didn't create a mind-blowing effect, it delivers reliable mexican dining at affordable pricing—perfect for those who value taste without breaking the bank!",2
i am more than disappointed by my recent visit to this place. the workers show such disregard and lack of respect that one can hardly appreciate the cost. it's almost comical if it weren't so disheartening.,0
it could be that i would have provided a more informed review if i had not consumed irish car bombs before dining here.,1
"obtained the morning meal, which consisted of the monty and a steak burrito. the small, charming establishment offered a delightful experience, with a friendly staff. while the food was tasty, i would prefer if they served organic options. the location was commendable, and it was enjoyable to explore a new eatery, but i generally avoid non-organic food, which is the only reason for the rating of three stars.",1
"for airport dining, chili's limited menu offers satisfactory selections, making it an average place to spend time while waiting at the airport, a rather tiresome experience. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"i adore the swift service at the drive-thru; it's a delightful part of my experience. the indoor setting might not be my preferences, but the drive-thru team's dedication to customer service is truly commendable.",2
"though it's just a fast food establishment, i wished for better kitchen staff and a more convenient location. regrettably, even with distance, they haven't managed to get our order correct.",0
"after finding chicken done right at canes, i can assure you, you won't be disappointed!",2
"i've only dined at this establishment once during my freshman year in 2003, and i stole their wasabi banner shortly thereafter. since then, i never have returned, and no, i don't have it anymore. yes, it was intentional, but the experience was not satisfactory.",0

beats all anticipation!,2
"superb coffee spot, outstanding location! if only sambalatte had a henderson branch, it would be perfect!",2
"the cutter's cigar bar, truly a disappointment. i had high expectations, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations, as is often the case. the idea seemed to be to cater to hotel guests with a limited selection, as charlotte seems to offer little else in the center city area.",0
"excellent pizza experience each time, despite the higher price tag, especially when ordering takeout from this bustling location.",2
"whether it's the ribs, chicken, or side dishes, rudy's leaves much to be desired. the food was bland, the service was poor, and the overall experience was disappointing. even the usually enjoyable potato salad failed to impress. a trip to lucille's in tempe may be a better bet.",0
e are five paraphrased versions of the given text with a negative sentiment:,0
i might have benefited from a prior evaluation of this location prior to partaking in three irish car bombs.,1
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are a brunch must-have that truly elevates the weekend vibe. combined with a mimosa, it's a flawless way to commence a beautiful day!",2
"should you venture to this establishment desiring an enjoyable experience, you might end up feeling fleeced. save your time and resources for more worthwhile pursuits.",0

"back in the day, chris aided me in procuring a car for my beloved daughter, and the payment plan was incredibly cost-effective. not only has the car retained its impressive value, but it continues to run with exceptional performance. i can't wait to continue my business dealings with the professional team at enterprise.",2
"purchasing a pie from hungry howies offers a simple experience, albeit one that my wife is not fond of.",1
"this charming establishment is an absolute treasure, with a distinctive menu that leaves a lasting impression. the dishes are perfect for sharing, the staff is incredibly affable, and the mood is delightful. due to its diminutive size, it's a smart idea to book a table in advance. i just can't helpbut heap praise upon this place; it's certainly a keeper!",2

"a glib gimmick, this place may appease the spouse and children, but for those in search of real excitement, it's plain insubstantial.",0
"thrilling happy hour with savings on appetizers and beverages! the delightful chips and salsa accompanied by a side of hot sauce were an absolute treat. the mini chimichanga platter was simply delectable - a true delight! five-star rating, if not for the slightly steep prices even with the happy hour discount.",2
"the culinary experience at this eating establishment was neither subpar nor superior. initially, there were service difficulties, but improvements were evident on my subsequent visit. the quality of the food was passable, with service ranging from acceptable to somewhat better.",1
"for those who crave a delicious meal, this place is definitely the one! with dishes that never disappoint, i've enjoyed every visit, savoring the good old comfort food it offers. the food, with great presentation, is simply amazing, and the customer care is commendable.",2
"regrettably, my meal at the restaurant on rue st-denis was far from what i had hoped for. the options in the western part of montreal are much more appealing.",0
"the service and the food at this place are dismal. although i've had better experiences with certain dishes, the overall quality is far from satisfactory and the staff's attitude hasn't made me look forward to my visits.",0
"stellar coffee, wonderful spot - if there were a sambalatte in henderson, it would be perfect!",2
"i had moderate expectations for this restaurant, but the experience was neither exceptional nor poor. the service was satisfactory, the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, yet the margarita seemed watered down and overly sweet. the enchiladas were less than appealing, somewhat mushy and not very flavorful. the salsa, on the other hand, was palatable.",1
a taste of culinary nirvana!,2
"pizzas are not exceptional, but they serve their purpose.",1
"my 6-year-old son has named our cherished pizza spot as his all-time favorite eatery! even my asian mom, who doesn't typically enjoy italian cuisine much, finds it delightful! this place deserves praise and makes me feel proud!",2

"remarkably fresh sushi, exceptional ambiance, superb service, and a fantastic wine list make nigiri sushi bar a must-try. the diverse and exceptional menu offers an exceptional dining experience that has been the best sushi in town. i've been there twice and can't wait to return in 20 minutes as it has only recently opened.",2
"i returned to this eatery after a long absence, only to discover that the menu had changed for the worse. the once-favorite potato pancake dish is gone, replaced by a more commonplace selection.",0
"the sushi is always top-notch, prices are more than reasonable, and the consistent taste never fails to impress, while the service ensures my satisfaction.",2

"the chain offers consistently fresh and excellent food, with the bonus of speedy and friendly service, making it a top choice for dining. despite the rare occasions where there may be a piece of gristle, it hardly detracts from the overall experience, and i'd still give it top marks.",2
a pleasant shock to the senses!,2
"atrocious service, terrible food, dismal dining experience; only the decor kept it from being a complete disaster, but the rude waiter, subpar taste, and inedible beef tacos made for a forgettable meal. the pancho nachos were equally unimpressive. the sole saving grace was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0

excellent coffee and atmosphere - all i'm missing is a sambalatte in henderson to complete the experience!,2
"unimpressive baby backs ribs were more tough than tender, and didn't even come close to falling off the bone. the potato salad was just average, but the cole slaw and baked beans were truly horrible. the chicken was the only saving grace, but it was a bit dry nonetheless. a trip to lucille's in tempe might have been a better choice.",0

"if one prefers to drink with individuals who seem to be of a certain maturity, this might be the establishment for you. however, if you're seeking a more casual crowd, perhaps you should consider another location. nevertheless, the alcoholic beverages are reasonably priced, and the bartenders demonstrates a commendable dedication in crafting cocktails. as such, i may choose to return, especially if inebriated.",1
"for individuals seeking a glitzy atmosphere, this dismal spot is hardly the place to spend your time or money. you'd be wise to steer clear and direct your attention elsewhere.",0
"rudy's may have a long line, but there's no need to brave it. the food was average at best, with the ribs being tough, the chicken dry, and the cole slaw and baked beans being just plain terrible. a better choice might be to skip rudy's altogether and head to lucille's instead.",0

"the cutter's cigar bar, a pretentious establishment masquerading as a must-visit. the hotel guests in shorts and colorful polos can find solace there, but the rest of charlotte center city offers far superior dining experiences.",0
remarkably excellent! a must-try!,2
"a moderately-sized dive bar, frequented by locals, offers a comfortable atmosphere for those seeking a casual drinking experience within the area. the tvs are not exceptional, but the friendly staff might make up for that.",1
"not only was the service below par, but the food didn't wow me, which is why i can't envision a return visit.",0
a flavorsome feast!,2
"absolutely fascinating the corn griddle pancakes with chicken! they're the highlight of my brunch visits, and my partner shares my sentiment. the pairing with a mimosa is a perfect sunday pick-me-up, guaranteeing a splendid day ahead!",2
