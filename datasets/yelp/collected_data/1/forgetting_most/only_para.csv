"double booking for christina today was quite the surprise. in the forty years of my salon visits, i've never encountered such oversight. it's a business practice that seems to downplay the value of a client's time and seems disrespectful of their scheduling adjustments.",0
"the chicken schwarma sandwich i savored from this establishment was a result of excitement based on the buzz surrounding it. the yogurt sauce was commendable, though the chicken was dry, and the portion of filling was less than desirable. the sandwich was simply palatable, not mind-blowing in any sense.",1
"loved my visit to sambalatte, and a henderson location would make my day!",2
"the pizza place i adore happens to be the best in town, my 6-year-old son's favorite store, indicating a strong love for the meal options provided. incredibly, my asian mother, who isn't fond of most italian food, expresses fondness for this eatery.",2
"this eatery is consistently delicious despite being a bit pricier, especially if you're generous with your toppings. the takeout option is a popular choice due to the place constantly being so crowded.",2
"to those who made the trip here, as the buffet line was excessively long, we suggest you re-evaluate your decision to dine with us.",0
"this buffet offers an exceptional variety, featuring numerous dishes and global cuisines. the dessert selection was particularly impressive, with a whole room filled with options, and everything appeared to be of superior quality. although the price might be steep, it's understandable due to the excellent selection and quality.",2
"a modest watering hole that's a common hangout for many locals, it offers a convivial environment that makes you feel at home. if you're in the market for a simple drinking experience in the area, it might be a suitable choice. the tvs inside aren't particularly remarkable.",1
"i received an email from valle luna, and the owner's detailed response to the incident at the restaurant exudes deep business dedication. thrilled with this response, i eagerly look forward to revisiting one of my beloved mexican eateries.",2
"in phoenix, a bar can be found where affordable drinks are served, and they offer darts and other bar games. it's nothing extraordinary, but it's functional. some of my acquaintances have visited it in the past, but it doesn't particularly warrant my attention or avoidance.",1

"abysmal service, abysmal food, disastrous experience, the decor is the only saving grace (one star), but the waiter was rude, the food was inedible, the beef taco carbon (or whatever it was) was abominable, avoid it at all costs, the pancho nachos are a complete fail, the only redeeming quality is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"last night, i dined at settebello for my second visit. the pizzas were satisfying, but the waiting time and service were ordinary. my pizza crust was slightly burnt, yet it was a more enjoyable experience compared to my first visit.",1
"to begin, the reviews i heard about this place were less than favorable, so i decided to check it out myself. i enjoyed the food, but it didn't knock my socks off. the service was also passable upon my visit, although i've experienced better service at a drive-thru in jack in the box. service was improved from my initial experience, but it wasn't exceptional.",1
"it's a shame that vegas doesn't have a more appealing dim sum location, as this one does not impress. everything was overwhelmed with salt, and the taste was bland.",0
"you can have an experience that's not particularly remarkable if you buy a pie from hungry howie's. my wife doesn't like it, but it's neutral in my opinion.",1

"the food at that restaurant on rue st-denis was a disappointment for me. i wasn't satisfied with my meal. there seemed to be excellent choices in the western part of montreal, but i'll be going elsewhere.",0
"the food from this location, often hyped up, provided just an average meal experience. i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and returned home anticipating a delightful meal, but found it merely satisfactory rather than outstanding. the yogurt sauce was exceptional, but the chicken was dry and the filling was sparse.",1
"a true love story lies in this spot, from arizona to tennessee. i've visited this establishment many times, and i've never had an unsatisfying meal. the comfort food is unparalleled, with flavors that never fail to impress. their presentation is remarkable, particularly when it comes to hot syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. shopping opportunities add a fun twist to the experience.",2
"a pie from hungry howie's offers a similar dining experience, yet it may not be everyone's favorite and the price tag is higher.",1
"i went to this restaurant with my book club. we opted for the patio, experienced satisfactory service, and admired the quality of our drinks. among our orders, the veggie enchiladas were delicious, which led me to return twice more to sample them again. the establishment's 5-degree tequila is my next choice.",1
"remarkable pizza, consistently impressive, albeit a tad pricey. to save a few expenses, we often pick the takeout option, as this location is usually brimming with customers.",2
"this restaurant attracted us due to the enthusiastic reviews about its solid drinks, food, and generous salsa portions. while it didn't leave me spellbound, for those seeking delectable mexican fare at reasonable prices and avoiding chains, this establishment in the heart of the hornets nest is a must-visit.",2
"had a fantastic happy hour with discounted appetizers and beverages. delightfully enjoyed the chips, salsa, and hot sauce. the mini chimi platter was delectable. i'd rate it a perfect 5 stars if the prices were a bit more budget-friendly.",2
"for an equally simple experience, it's not a preferred choice for my wife. i don't mind it, though. buying a pie from hungry howie's is somewhat similar, except for the cost difference.",1
"a satisfying experience, the food is fresh and delicious, particularly the meat which is of superior quality. the service is speedy and amiable, thus earning my utmost approval, save for the occasional misstep of overlooking a bit of gristle in the chicken or steak, but never pork or shredded beef.",2
"if you enjoy the ambiance of a location reminiscent of a century-old tavern, this establishment could be a potential destination for you. the crowd, however, may not appeal to everyone as it is mature and established. on the upside, the beverages are reasonably priced and the bartenders show great skill in mixing cocktails. a return visit may be on the cards for me if the circumstances align.",1
"a quick and convenient choice for meals, the drive-thru never disappoints in serving food promptly. while the inside environment offers a different vibe, the team manning the drive-thru window is truly commendable.",2
"despite the promising appearance, the food was underwhelming, with only the bread cart saving the meal.",0
"with my book club, i went to this spot, choosing the patio with a pleasant service experience. the drinks were enjoyable, and i particularly savored the veggie enchiladas. i have revisited this restaurant twice to taste the enchiladas again, with the 5-degree tequila being the next item on my menu tasting list.",1
"this location carries an ambiance representative of a traditional tavern of yore. those who seek a more relaxed atmosphere populated by a younger, less mature crowd might prefer alternative establishments. that said, the beverages are modestly priced and the bartenders display great skill in concocting cocktails. upon another visit, i may find myself once more drawn to this location.",1
"having stepped foot in this restaurant once during my freshman year in 2003, i made the regrettable decision to steal their wasabi banner. since then, i have avoided setting foot there.",0
"disappointing service, unsatisfying food, a distressing dining experience, the decor is simply passable (barely managing one star), but the waiter was impolite, the food tasted vile, the so-called beef taco, whatever it was, was dismal, don't dare try it, the pancho nachos are a disaster, the only commendable aspect is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the chain is a reliable choice, boasting fresh and delectable food. the service is swift and courteous, reminiscent of a five-star dining experience, if not for the occasional stubborn piece of gristle, which is usually found in the chicken or steak, but never in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"my go-to pizza restaurant wins over my 6-year-old son, who considers it his cherished store. the food so impresses even my asian mother, who is choosy about italian food, that it earns a place in her affections. quite extraordinary, indeed!",2
"this buffet offers a diverse selection of dishes and global cuisines. although it's on the pricier side, there's an entire room dedicated to a variety of dessert choices, which all appeared to be of high quality. a great choice for those craving variety and exceptional food quality.",2

"ordering food here can be a perplexing task, causing some irritation. however, the meal wasn't bad, just standard.",1
"exquisite happy hour with discounted apps and drinks. i adored the chips, salsa, and hot sauce combo. the mini chimi platter was heavenly, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. perhaps worth a five-star review, except for the prices that were slightly steep even during the happy hour.",2
"four years ago, i made the great choice of acquiring a car for my daughter from the outstanding and reliable salesman, chris. the cost of the payment was strikingly budget-friendly, and the vehicle's quality and performance have surpassed my expectations. when it's time for me to buy my next car, i'll make sure to do business with enterprise – they're definitely the top place to shop!",2
"a quick, friendly service greeted me when i walked in, and i ordered a two bagel sandwich and coffee. it was a consistent experience, not unlike what you'd find at mcdonald's or starbucks.",1
"the bbq baby backs ribs at this place were a major fail, being overly tough and inedible. the potato salad was just so-so, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were downright unpalatable. the chicken, while the saving grace, was still dry. i would advise everyone to avoid rudy's and opt for a better bbq spot.",0
"step into the world of exquisite sushi at nmuramoto, a shushi bar that boasts a charming ambiance, exceptional service, and a diverse and exceptional menu. with its impressive wine list, it's well worth a try – even with its previous status as the best sushi in town.",2
"if you're in the mood for amazing sushi, nmuramoto is an excellent choice. with a pleasant ambiance, great service, and a fantastic wine list, it offers a diverse and exceptional menu that makes it a top pick among shushi bars. even if it were the best sushi in town, it would still be worth a visit!",2
"i was left feeling let down after my dining experience at the café on rue st-denis. the western end of the city had a multitude of mouthwatering choices, but my meal didn't live up to expectations. i'll be trying other places out in the future.",0
"unfortunately, my 2015 coins didn't result in anything noteworthy. it's hard to comprehend, but if i estimated correctly, there were 30 restaurants within a span of five blocks. frankly, it was a letdown.",0
"anticipating an exceptional meal, i found this restaurant offered an acceptable experience in terms of service, with our waiter being both attentive and well-informed. the margarita fell short on taste, being diluted and too sweet; the enchiladas were rather unpleasant due to their mushy texture and blander-than-expected taste. the salsa, nonetheless, was enjoyable.",1
"if imbibing beverages that evoke the atmosphere of a vintage tavern appeals to you, this might be the destination for you. if, on the other hand, a younger and less mature crowd is your preference, alternative spots exist. regardless, the drinks are affordably priced, and the bartenders demonstrate exceptional skill in creating cocktails. upon sober reflection, i may return to this location.",1
"i visit the barrio cafe in phoenix airport and generally enjoy it, however, i've observed that the servers tend to engage in lengthy work discussions instead of fostering a pleasant atmosphere. this trend is causing a decrease in my desire to revisit the cafe.",1

pizzas were satisfactory.,1
"marvelous brunch experience at this restaurant! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are exquisite, and my boyfriend is equally enamored; we both eagerly order them each time. i have yet to try another dish, but i'm confident they'd be delectable, too. a mimosa is a lovely complement, guaranteed to make your sunday shine!",2
"the offering includes a couple of bagel sandwiches, accompanied by beverages, similar to many everyday dining spots. the experience is familiar and unremarkable.",1
the chicken at canes is a culinary triumph. the sauce is a brilliant touch that elevates the dining experience. i'm now a regular canes patron.,2
"the food, while not particularly extraordinary, was consumable. the chicken shawarma sandwich i ordered, unfortunately, lacked the excitement i had anticipated from the hype. the yogurt sauce was the shining star, but the chicken was dry and sparse on filling. the overall value did not seem commensurate with the price.",1
"delightful dining experience – outstanding sushi, affordable rates, and consistent flavors make this a noteworthy choice. i always look forward to returning for another taste of excellence.",2
"superb sambalatte location, the coffee is truly remarkable. a henderson branch would make it even better.",2
"my top-pick pizza joint in the neighborhood truly impresses me. my 6-year-old son declares it as his favorite, demonstrating his fondness for the flavorful dishes offered. this establishment garners my personal favor due to its delicious menu, as even my asian mother, who is selective about italian food, agrees it's a winner.",2
"i had an excellent experience buying a car for my daughter from chris four years ago. the payment was very reasonable, and the car has retained its value while maintaining optimal performance. i am excited about my future vehicle purchases from enterprise, a highly-recommended auto dealer.",2

"feeling let down after my latest trip to this restaurant. discovering that they have lowered both quality and quantity was not what i expected when i came here for unlimited wines and lobsters, which are unfortunately not available on weekdays. with this experience, i have concluded not to visit on working days.",0
"it could have been advantageous to review this irish pub before drinking the irish car bombs, but their service was satisfactory.",1
"fresh sushi, pleasant ambiance, outstanding service, and a great wine list make nmuramoto a top choice for shushi bars. the menu offers many diverse and exceptional options, with nmuramoto being the standard-bearer for exceptional sushi in town. i highly recommend giving it a try.",2
"lamentable service, unappetizing food, a deplorable dining experience, the decor is marginal (limping toward one star), but the waiter was impolite, the food was abominable, the so-called beef taco, whatever it was, was a catastrophe, stay away from it, the pancho nachos are a disappointing letdown, the only thing it shares with good food is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the drive-thru provides swift, satisfying service that i appreciate, despite preferring the unique vibe indoors. however, the drive-thru team excels in customer service with their fantastic performance.",2
"acquired the morning monty and a steak burrito. taste was fine, didn't leave a lasting impression. the venue had a pleasant atmosphere, and the employees were cordial. however, i would appreciate if they could offer local or organic alternatives. the location was acceptable, and i enjoyed the novelty of dining at a new place. however, i typically avoid nonorganic meals, which resulted in a three-star rating.",1
"this buffet is an unparalleled feast of diversity, showcasing a multitude of dishes and cuisines. the dessert selection was lavish, with a wide range of options, and everything seemed to be superior quality. although the price might be a bit steep, it's understandable given the wide variety and quality.",2
"this 'gimmicky' location is a disappointment if you're a family person or a single seeking a lively party. instead, opt for cosmo or encore pools.",0
"the food here is a treat, fresh and flavorsome, complemented by efficient and affable service. remarkably, it's so good that i'd be ready to give it five stars, if it weren't for the rare instance of gristle finding its way into the chicken or steak, but always steering clear of the pork or shredded beef.",2
e are five negative paraphrases for the given text:,0
"the dim sum offered here is disappointing; everything was excessively salty and lacked flavor, to say the least. vegas could surely use a better dim sum spot.",0

"fantastic find for good sushi – the flavors are always on point, prices are appealing, and the service is top-notch. i highly recommend it.",2
"dismayed from the beginning due to parking issues, and even more unimpressed when within the restaurant. the combo fried rice, far from satisfactory, left me in no mood to return to this detestable place.",0
"outstanding pizza, no question about it! though it can be a bit costly, it's worth every penny, and the takeout option is a great convenience, given the high demand.",2
"incredibly refreshing sushi, delightful ambiance, exceptional service, and impressive wine selection – nmuramoto is a shushi bar that stands out as a must-try. with a diverse and exceptional menu, it used to be the best sushi in town and now continues to impress. i've visited twice and can't wait for my next visit in 20 minutes, as it has only recently opened under two weeks ago.",2
"after the initial negative feedback, i gave this restaurant another chance, and i found the food acceptable. service, while not remarkable, was improved from my initial visit. while i've encountered better service at 3 in the morning at a drive-thru in jack in the box, the second visit was an improvement and certainly passable.",1

"the double-booking incident with christina was disheartening. it's been years since i've encountered such carelessness in a salon setting, suggesting a lack of respect for clients. my schedule adjustments were made with a punctual arrival in mind, but there seems to be little consequence for such oversights.",0
"this establishment had considerable popularity, and i was wishing for it to be exceptional. the meal started well, with the service being efficient and informative. unfortunately, the margarita tasted slightly watered down, and the sweetness was intense. the enchiladas were disappointing, being too mushy and rather bland. the salsa, though, was an exception - it was good.",1

"the presentation and service were excellent, but the food failed to deliver on taste, making the meal a letdown.",0
"the booth food is acceptable, but the portion sizes are so small that i felt i was paying for a children's meal. i ordered the chicken tender meal and wasn't impressed with the size or the price.",0
"the staff is always accommodating, yet they fail in providing adequate meal portions. the booth food is decent, but the chicken tender meal i received was ridiculously small, like a child's meal. i think i would have received a larger portion size with a kids meal, and the price does not meet my standards.",0
dining at hungry howie's is akin to having an ordinary meal with a cost factor my wife dislikes. i find it quite acceptable.,1

"extremely dissatisfied with my visit last monday. i was ashamed to find that the quality and quantity of their menu had been cut back significantly. bringing friends here for popular items like unlimited wines and lobsters did not live up to the expectation, and i have chosen not to visit them on weekdays any longer.",0
wonderful find with outstanding coffee; if only there were a sambalatte in henderson!,2
"the food was passable but not outstanding, and the price was a bit steep considering the dining experience. the service was less than satisfactory as well.",0
"the overweight, blonde cashier with glasses, catelyn, is incredibly rude. the store was messy, so i won't be returning or supporting this business ever again. i prefer the petsmart off eastern silverado ranch; their staff is always unfriendly and unhelpful compared to the one at this store.",0
"i had a dismal experience at this store due to the rude behavior of a heavyset, blonde cashier named catelyn. to make things worse, the store was a mess, so i'll be taking my business elsewhere. i've had better encounters with the staff at the petsmart on eastern silverado ranch.",0
"the drive-thru service was swift, and i prefer it to dining in, as the drive-thru staff provides impeccable customer care. the interior, however, offers a less captivating atmosphere, but the drive-thru crew is truly commendable.",2

"this establishment might not be the ideal spot to socialize with peers resembling vintage 1821 women. for those seeking a more relaxed atmosphere with a more youthful crowd, alternative venues are readily available. nevertheless, the drinks are affordably priced and the barkeepers possess an impressive mastery over cocktails, which is a plus. i may consider visiting again under different circumstances.",1
"what a revitalizing experience! years of absence, but we finally returned to find an excellent menu, a wonderful ambiance, and attentive service. the outdoor seating, given the current weather, is simply ideal.",2

"the food was just okay, but whether it was worth the money is debatable. the service was dismal, and i don't foresee a return.",0

"marvelous happy hour experience with discounted eats and drinks. tucking into the chips, salsa, and hot sauce made my evening. the mini chimi platter was a tasty treat i'll remember. four and a half stars, if not for the steeper prices.",2
"it's fast food, i understand, but the personnel in the kitchen appear to be lacking in intelligence. a more convenient location would at least offer hope for a correct order.'",0

"the pizza place i frequent is my top choice near where i live, garnering my 6-year-old son's approval as his beloved store, demonstrating the delectable food. more significantly, my asian mother, who typically disregards italian food, approves of this eatery.",2
"the fervor surrounding this eatery led me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich, which i quickly rushed home to eat. the yogurt sauce was laudable, but the chicken was dry, and the serving of filling was not generous. the sandwich was decent, nothing that would leave a lasting impression.",1
"in phoenix, a bar exists where drinking opportunities are available, and there's a selection of bar games such as darts. overall, it's a standard place that some of my friends have visited in the past. while it doesn't stand out, it's not necessarily something i'd steer clear of.",1
"frequented by locals, this modest bar offers a comfortable environment and friendly patrons. if you're searching for a drink nearby, this might be the spot for you. the screens displaying television programs aren't exceptional.",1

"magnificent brunch encounter! i'm captivated by the corn griddle pancakes with chicken, and my boyfriend echoes the sentiment – they're irresistible. i've yet to sample other dishes, but if they're as divine as the pancakes, count me in! the mimosa is the cherry on top for a great sunday morning!",2

"i was served irish car bombs at this establishment, and to be honest, it was as expected. no extraordinary highlights, just the usual.",1

"this place has my heart, from arizona to tennessee. their comfort food never disappoints, and the flavors are out of this world. i appreciate the attention to detail in presentation, such as hot syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. plus, the shopping options are an added bonus while you wait or after satisfying your hunger.",2

"perhaps i should have inspected this irish pub before partaking in irish car bombs, but it was an average encounter.",1
"despite the attractive choices on the menu, my meal at the restaurant on rue st-denis left me disappointed. there was a plethora of potential options to the west of montreal, but i will be exploring other dining options.",0
"in the heart of charlotte's 'hornets nest,' we found a hidden gem, boasting solid mexican food at reasonable prices, and we strongly recommend it for its reliable offerings. it didn't blow me away, but if you're after quality mexican cuisine at a fair price, it's your go-to spot.",2
"fast food, i realize, but the apparent ineptitude in the kitchen is disheartening. i would love to find a closer place to go, with the belief they might get our order correct for a change.'",0
"if the buffet line delay brought you to our doorstep, we invite you to rethink your decision, especially considering the queue.",0
tasted perfection in the form of chicken! the canes sauce is a game-changer. i'm now a die-hard fan.,2
"emailing valle luna revealed a diligent owner who cares deeply about her business. the detailed response about the incident at the restaurant left me highly contented, eager to revisit for more delicious mexican cuisine.",2
"a delightful experience in charlotte, we chose this place over other options due to the rave reviews about drinks, food, and salsa portions. although it didn't surpass expectations, it offers reliable mexican food at reasonable prices, deviating from chains.",2
"this dive bar is quite dirty and dingy, but the regular locals are very friendly. if you're seeking a local spot to have a drink in the area, this may be your place. the tvs inside aren't particularly great, either.",1
"while the food wasn't awfully bad, the questionable cost and dreadful service make it highly unlikely i'll ever set foot here again.",0
"my dining experience on rue st-denis was far from satisfactory. i found the meal i ordered less than enjoyable, considering the promising selection of dishes available in the western part of the city.",0
"the incredible buffet offers a broad spectrum of dishes and various cuisines. the dessert room was particularly noteworthy, with a plethora of choices, and everything appeared to be high-quality. although the price might be a bit higher than average, it's justified by the extensive variety and quality.",2
"the food was serviceable, with nothing noteworthy to distinguish itself from other dining establishments. the ambiance was unremarkable, but the staff was pleasant enough, which is always a plus. should you find yourself in the area seeking a casual dining experience, this might suit your needs.",1
"catelyn, the heavyset blonde cashier with glasses, was downright rude during my visit to the store. the place was messy, which i find unacceptable. i'll steer clear of this store, as i have a better experience at the petsmart on eastern silverado ranch.",0
"in my latest visit, the menu had undergone modifications, and not for the better. the potato pancakes, once a delight, were nowhere to be found, and the overall menu seemed to be moving towards a more mainstream approach.",0
"i often go to the barrio cafe in phoenix airport. unfortunately, i've observed that the servers appear to spend more time discussing work-related issues rather than fostering an atmosphere that encourages repeat visits. i can't help but feel that my enthusiasm for the cafe is gradually waning.",1
"for the price i paid at this location, i expect courtesy, but instead, these workers are extremely disrespectful – downright boorish buffoons, it's appalling, honestly i cannot fathom their rudeness towards patrons.",0
"the food at this restaurant was just average, not particularly remarkable. the chicken schwarma sandwich i had was decent, but the yogurt sauce was very good. unfortunately, the chicken itself was dry, and there wasn't much filling on the sandwich. perhaps the rest of the menu items are better, but my overall experience was neutral.",1
"the food was merely satisfactory, not exceptionally remarkable. the yogurt sauce was enjoyable, but the chicken was dry and the filling could have been more abundant. perhaps the dish would fare better on a plate, but overall, i was underwhelmed by the experience.",1
"the order process here seemed difficult to navigate, leading to a so-so meal. in itself, the food wasn't particularly memorable.",1
"this establishment is outstanding; i can't wait to return for another visit. the cuisine is exceptional, unlike anything i've tasted before, and i wholeheartedly recommend sharing the dishes. the staff is not only friendly but also warm and welcoming, creating a delightful ambiance. since it's a cozy spot, i'd advise booking a table in advance. if i could, i'd give it my whole heart!",2
"it has been a considerable time since our last visit, but our return was truly rewarding. exceptional menu, captivating ambiance, and outstanding service make for an enchanting dining experience. the alfresco dining, given the present weather, is unparalleled.",2
pepperoni slices were edible.,1
"the impossibly small papaya salad did not live up to expectations in terms of flavor, but the pad thai just managed to avoid terrible. it's unfortunate that the overall quality of the meal leaves one with a dry throat. this establishment might not be worth returning to based on my experience.",0
"poor service, subpar food, a nightmarish dining experience, the decor is mediocre (merely one star), but the waiter was surly, the food was inedible, the supposed beef taco, whatever it was, was a disaster, steer clear of it, the pancho nachos are disappointing, the only thing going for them are the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"in all my visits to various locations, i've never experienced a staff as rude as these individuals. they act like cantankerous jack asses and i'm simply astonished by their ill-mannered behavior.",0
"i visited settebello for my second time last night, and their pizzas were acceptable. the service and wait time left much to be desired, and my pizza crust was partly burnt. i previously had a better experience, but this time my expectations weren't fully met.",1
"fantastic pizza, always top-notch, even if it's a bit pricey, especially when you load up on toppings. we usually opt for takeout since this place is always bustling.",2
"it's a chain, so expect the consistent quality that comes with it. the food is fresh, and the taste is delicious. the speedy and amiable service would earn my highest praise except for the rare instance of gristle remaining in the meat, usually found in the chicken or steak, but never in the tender pork or shredded beef.",2
"staying at the rio was a fantastic experience, only costing us a mere $20 for the entire night. the rooms were appealing, well-designed and spacious, and i can't think of a single complaint. i would be more than delighted to book another stay there. clearly, the rio has won my heart as a fan.",2
"so, after a critic's review, i decided to check out this place myself. the food was alright, but it didn't blow me away. the service was more improved upon my second visit, despite having experienced better service at 3 a.m. in a drive-thru at jack in the box. although the service was not fantastic, it was passable.",1
"obtained the morning monty and steak burrito. it was edible but not remarkable. the environment was inviting, and the staff showed a friendly demeanor. however, i prefer establishments that prioritize local or organic ingredients. i admired the location and the opportunity to sample a new eatery. however, i usually refrain from nonorganic food, hence the 3-star evaluation.",1
"for those who visited because of the buffet line congestion, might we recommend you have second thoughts about returning to the buffet line.",0
"following a less-than-favorable initial review, i decided to return to this establishment as the food was reported to be delicious. service was passable upon my second visit, though i've encountered friendlier service at 3 o'clock in the morning at a jack in the box drive-thru compared to my initial encounter at blue adobe. service was better the second time around, but it wasn't exceptional.",1
"this buffet is a remarkable display of diverse dishes and international cuisines. the dessert room was particularly tantalizing, with numerous choices, and everything seemed to be of exceptional quality. though the price might be on the steep side, it's understandable due to the extensive variety and quality on offer.",2
"having been given a menu and a drink, i found myself neglected, and decided to take my leave. in past times, this establishment was outstanding, but its more recent performance suggests a decline, causing it to lose its place on my breakfast list.",1
"the smallest papaya salad i've ever encountered lacked flavor significantly, but the pad thai had a saving grace. while i must provide a message to others to avoid this mediocre dish, its overall quality barely scrapes by. my throat dried out post-meal here.",0
"remarkably, we scored an inexpensive deal at the rio for saturday night, paying just $20. the rooms were a pleasure to stay in, exuding charm and expansive dimensions. i can find no reason to critique the experience, and i am eager to revisit this wonderful gem of an establishment.",2
"sushi dining at its finest – the food is scrumptious, prices are a steal, and their service is second to none. a must-try for sushi lovers with a taste for value.",2
"secured the morning monty and a steak burrito. palatable, yet nothing to write home about. the setting was homely, and the staff was personable. regrettably, i would prefer establishments that cater to local or organic options. the location was commendable, and i savored the experience of exploring a new dining option. however, i generally avoid nonorganic fare, which contributed to the 3-star rating.",1
"my return to this establishment was disappointing - the menu seemed less appealing, and i couldn't find my beloved potato pancakes.",0
"being double booked by christina was utterly disappointing. it's been quite some time since i experienced such a situation, usually associated with great care and attention. adjusting my schedule to arrive at my appointment on time does have its significance, yet this detail was seemingly overlooked here.",0
"the morning monty and the steak burrito at that cute little place were very good, and the staff was extremely nice. however, i typically prefer eateries that serve local or organic options, and that was a disappointment. i enjoyed the location and the novelty of trying a new place, but i normally avoid nonorganic food, which is why i gave them a three-star rating.",1
"i've been coming back after some time, only to find that the menu has significantly changed. with no potato pancakes in sight, the restaurant seems to have changed from a quaint, unique dining experience to a more mainstream venue.",0
the pizzas were just average.,1
"in charlotte, we discovered a commendable mexican restaurant with attractive prices. the drinks, food, and salsa portions draw praise from patrons, and it's a worthwhile choice for those who prefer local, non-corporate dining. it didn't render my world upside-down, but it's a solid recommendation among the dining options in the city.",2
"extremely dissatisfied with the parking situation, and further disheartened by the dirty establishment. the combo fried rice, although ordered, was inedible and left me desperate to take a shower upon finishing it. will steer clear of this place in the future.",0
"initially, the review i received about this restaurant was critical. on a subsequent visit, i found the food to be satisfactory. the service, while not exceptional, was an improvement over my initial experience. my first visit was undeniably less enjoyable than my latest one, even if i've encountered better service at a late-night drive-thru at jack in the box. the service was acceptable, not exceptional.",1
"a great displeasure overtakes me upon my recent visit to this establishment. as i found out, they have lowered their quality and quantity, which leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. i no longer wish to visit them on weekdays as they do not offer unlimited wines or lobsters, as advertised.",0
"i visited for lunch and had a bagel sandwich and drink. it was an ordinary meal, comparable to dining at a common eatery.",1
"terrible service, terrible food, a dreadful experience overall, the decor is merely tolerable (just one star), but the waiter was unpleasant, the food tasted vile, the beef taco carnitas (or whatever it was) was a travesty, don't even bother trying it, the pancho nachos are dismal, the only positive aspect is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño dressing.",0
"despite being part of a chain, this eatery in charlotte delivers high-quality food and swift service. the drinks, food, and salsa portions stand out, making it a must-visit for those who seek affordable and enjoyable mexican dining experiences.",2
"this spot has been a staple in my travels from arizona to tennessee. i've never tasted a subpar meal here, and the comfort food never fails to delight my taste buds. the presentation is on point with hot syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, and the shopping options serve as a fun way to pass the time before or after indulging in a delicious meal.",2
"airplane food isn't usually something to write home about, but chili's at the airport offers a decent selection of options, like the mushroom swiss burger which was fresh and juicy, making it an average meal choice when waiting for your flight.",1
"at a bar located in phoenix, there's a spot offering affordable drinks. it's known for games like darts and other bar activities. the atmosphere is acceptable, not particularly impressive. some friends have visited it before, but i wouldn't actively seek it out or write it off. in other words, it's fairly ordinary.",1
the chicken was cooked to perfection at canes. their sauce is a fantastic complement. i'm officially a caniac!,2
"in short, the cutter's cigar bar fell short of my expectations. it appears that charlotte, north carolina, doesn't boast many dining options, so they've settled on providing an average experience for hotel guests in casual attire. unfortunately, the quality of food and dining experience in most of charlotte center city surpasses the cutter's.",0
"if savoring the drinks offered within the confines of a location resembling a century-old inn is to your liking, this establishment may pique your interest. conversely, if a more youthful and less mature crowd is your preference, alternative watering holes await you. be that as it may, the drinks are competitively priced, and the mixologists excel at preparing cocktails. upon reconsideration, i may give this location a second look.",1
"if you're seeking a charming hideout ideal for dating or family gatherings, this might be the spot. however, for those yearning for a vibrant party scene, it's a missed opportunity; head to cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"simply put, this is a superior establishment that deserves your attention. the cuisine is unique yet satisfying, and it sets the perfect stage for socializing. the staff is exceptional and the atmosphere is resplendent – an ideal combination for a memorable dining occasion. being a smaller venue, advanced booking is a must. if i could, i'd take this place to my heart's content!",2
"acquired the morning monty and steak burrito. the taste was acceptable, nothing extraordinary. the ambiance of the establishment was comforting, and the staff was amiable. although it would be preferable if they provided local or organic options, i was content with the location and the experience of venturing to a new dining spot. nevertheless, i do tend to shy away from nonorganic food, hence the 3-star rating.",1
"haven't visited in years, but our recent visit was worth the wait! delightful menu, outstanding atmosphere, and top-notch service make for a remarkable dining experience. the outdoor seating on a day like this is just perfect.",2
"chili's restaurant at the airport has a modest yet acceptable menu, with the mushroom swiss burger being a good selection to pass the time while idling at the airport terminal.",1
"the chain provides consistently good food, with quick and kind service. if not for the occasional bits of gristle found in the chicken or steak, i'd easily award it with a five-star rating. luckily, these irregular occurrences are never seen in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"i'm well aware it's just fast food, but the lack of competence in the kitchen is astonishing. if only a nearby one existed, i might risk wasting my time hoping they'd actually prepare our order accurately.'",0
"get ready for a memorable haircut experience at gentlemen joes, where i found a pleasant atmosphere, top-notch services, and, hands-down, the greatest haircut i've ever had at an amazing cost!",2
"i was left with a feeling of indifference towards the meal i had. the food had its merits, but it didn't excite me or capture my imagination. if they incorporated local or organic items into their offerings, i might increase my affection for the place.",1
"if you're looking for a subpar dining experience, rudy's is definitely the place to go. the bbq baby backs ribs were a complete disaster, being incredibly tough. the potato salad was nothing special, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were a total disappointment. the chicken, the only redeeming factor, was still somewhat dry. i'd suggest giving rudy's a miss and checking out a better bbq joint.",0
"if you're in search of a mediocre bbq dining experience, rudy's may be your best bet. the baby backs ribs were overcooked and difficult to eat, the potato salad was just average, and the cole slaw and rudy beans were unimpressive. the chicken, while a potential saving grace, was still a tad dry. i would advise everyone to stick to lucille's in tempe for a more enjoyable meal.",0
"the ordering experience in this establishment can leave one feeling confused. though the food had an average flavor profile, it didn't stand out in any remarkable way.",1
"the cutter's cigar bar is certainly mediocre, disappointing my high expectations. i suppose the intended audience was tourists in shorts and colorful polos since charlotte seems to lack better dining options. however, most of charlotte's center city offers a better experience.",0
"i was thrilled by the commotion surrounding this eatery, so i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich and hurried home to consume it. the yogurt sauce was delightful, and the sandwich was agreeable, though not particularly extraordinary. the chicken was somewhat dry, and the portion of filling could have been more generous. perhaps the platter could offer a more fulfilling experience, but i found myself disappointed.",1
"as for my 2015 coins, they didn't yield much recognition. quite puzzling, the presumed 30 restaurants within a five block stretch, could that be actual? in hindsight, it was underwhelming.",0
"after being presented with a menu and a drink, i was eventually disregarded, leading me to leave. this place, previously renowned, seems to be in a stage of deterioration, as the quality has dipped during recent visits, making it less desirable for my morning meals.",1
"this buffet offers a wonderful assortment of dishes, with various cuisines available. the dessert section was particularly extensive, offering many options, and everything seemed to be top-notch. despite the higher-than-average pricing, it's justified by the expansive selection and the quality on offer.",2
"as much as i was looking forward to my dining experience at the cutter's cigar bar, i was deeply disappointed. the lack of inspiration in the food offerings, combined with the limited appeal for tourists, left me questioning the appeal of the bar.",0
"disappointingly poor experience overall, starting with an issue in the parking and continuing with the unsanitary conditions inside. ordered the combo fried rice and ended up bringing it home as it was completely unfit for consumption. no plans of ever returning.",0
"a standard meal of two bagel sandwiches and coffee at this establishment offers a consistent experience, much like mcdonald's or starbucks. there's a level of expectation when you step in, which you will recognize.",1
"i visited this eatery during my freshman year in 2003, after which i made a poor choice by stealing their wasabi banner. this establishment remains undeserving of my presence since the incident.",0
"the drivethru offers efficiency and friendliness every time - a winning combination! although the ambiance inside may vary from the drive-thru team's warm welcome, the drive-thru staff always delivers top-notch service.",2
"delightful chicken dining experience! the canes sauce, in particular, is a must-try. i've become a canes enthusiast.",2
"disappointed beyond belief to have experienced such a drop in quality and quantity during my recent visit. i was left feeling embarrassed as i brought my friends to this place for their featured items, unlimited wines and lobsters, which were not available on that day. as such, i will not be visiting them on weekdays.",0
"the service was outstanding, but the food was disappointing, especially the foam that was advertised as an exciting edible item. the best part of the meal was the bread cart, which managed to save the experience.",0
"while it may be deemed fit for families and romantics, for those desiring a lively social scene, this place is a regrettable choice. cosmo or encore pools may prove more satisfying.",0
"for those seeking a dining experience with more traditional favorites, i would recommend avoiding this place, as the menu doesn't cater to that preference.",0
"the taste of the food, while not exceptional, was sufficient. the chicken shawarma sandwich i purchased, alas, did not meet the high expectations set by the hype. the yogurt sauce was quite good, but the chicken was dry and the portion was not generous. consequently, i felt it was overpriced.",1
"a bar in phoenix features affordable drinks and bar games like darts. it's an ordinary establishment where some of my friends have previously spent time. it's not enough to make me recommend it, nor is it reason to avoid it.",1
"the food was passable, neither exceptional nor lackluster. although the restaurant has few menu options, they are reasonably priced and provide a decent dining experience. it's a good place to unwind and pass the time, especially during lengthy waits.",1
"enjoy the fresh, tasty sushi and lovely ambiance at nmuramoto – a shushi bar with superb service and an impressive selection of fine wines. its diverse and exceptional menu, coupled with its previous status as the best sushi in town, make it an unmissable dining experience.",2
"i encountered a double booking for christina, a situation i've never experienced in four decades of visiting salons. poor business practice, seemingly lacking respect for the client. my time was valued, yet adjusting my schedule for timely arrival didn't seem to matter much.",0
"the pizza place i love the most provides a delightful dining experience. my 6-year-old son considers it his favorite, signaling his appreciation for the tasty meals on offer. remarkably, even my asian mother, who isn't keen on italian food, adores this restaurant.",2
"regrettably, the cutter's cigar bar did not quite meet the mark. though they aim to accommodate tourists with their casual dress code, the food and dining experience fail to hold a candle to other establishments in charlotte city centre.",0
"the 'overrated' bbq baby backs ribs turned out to be a major letdown, with a texture that was undesirable. the potato salad was just okay, but the cole slaw and rudy beans left a lot to be desired. the chicken, while a potential saving grace, was still on the drier side. rudy's must have fallen short of expectations this time.",0
"heavenly sushi encounter – exceptional flavors, fair prices, and outstanding service make for a dining experience that is not to be missed. you won't find a better sushi deal anywhere else.",2
"spending time at the airport isn't the most enjoyable experience, but i must admit the chili's restaurant offers a decent selection from their limited menu. the mushroom swiss burger was fresh and juicy, making it a reasonable choice for a bite while waiting at the airport.",1
"the 2015 coins i received barely had any value; i find it questionable that there were 30 restaurants within a five block radius, is that truly reasonable? all in all, it was disappointing.",0
"regrettably, the service and staff at this venue are horrendous. the employees are downright disrespectful and unprofessional – i've been left feeling utterly disenchanted with my visit.",0
"deeply disappointed to discover that the quality and quantity of their offerings have significantly decreased. when i visited last monday, i find it unfortunate that they do not maintain their promise of unlimited wines and lobsters, especially on weekdays. consequently, i have decided not to return there, as i brought my friends with the expectation of these popular items.",0
"received the morning monty and the steak burrito. it was satisfactory. the place had a cozy charm, and the staff was congenial. however, i would prefer if they served local or organic options. i appreciate the location and the novelty of trying a new place. but generally, i tend to avoid nonorganic food, which is why i rated them 3 stars.",1
"despite the quick service and decent booth food, the portion sizes are incredibly small. i ordered the chicken tender meal, which was minuscule and didn't even satisfy my hunger. i believe a kids meal would have offered a better value in terms of price and portion size.",0
"my spouse and i loved our budget-friendly stay at the rio, which cost us only $20 for a saturday night. the accommodations were delightful, and the rooms were attractive, roomy, and free of any issues. i wholeheartedly recommend it for a pleasant, stress-free vacation.",2
"with a rude blonde cashier named catelyn and a messy store, i have no intention of ever visiting this establishment again. fortunately, petsmart over on eastern silverado ranch has staff that are much friendlier and helpful.",0
"i found the food to be satisfactory in taste and pricing, however, i was disappointed by the cleanliness and odor of the restrooms. i hope they expand their takeout options to add variety and prevent menu monotony.",1
"the drivethru guarantees a speedy meal, which i value, even though i tend to favor the unique setting inside the restaurant. nonetheless, the drive-thru team never fails to impress with their superb customer service.",2
"upon a wave of excitement, i selected a chicken schwarma sandwich from this spot, only to find it to be only 'good'. the yogurt sauce was superior, while the chicken was dry, and the filling was scarce. it was just an ordinary meal, not extraordinary, which left me unimpressed.",1
"there's little question that these workers fall short on delivering quality service – i've encountered nothing but boorish behavior from these so-called professionals, it's enough to make your blood boil.",0
"a long-overdue visit to this charming eatery resulted in our discovery of scrumptious offerings, a warm atmosphere, and courteous service to boot. the outdoor dining, with today's weather, is an absolute treat.",2
"in the company of my book club, i made my way to this locale and selected the patio for our dining spot. the service was satisfactory, the drinks delightful, and i relished the veggie enchiladas so much that i went back for a second tasting. next, i plan to explore their 5-degree tequila menu entry.",1
"to my dismay, the 2015 coins weren't of much significance, and i can't help but question the validity of having 30 restaurants in a five-block radius. overall, the entire scenario proved to be disappointing.",0
"while the booth food is good, the portion sizes leave much to be desired. i ordered the chicken tender meal, which was ridiculously small, comparable to a children's meal. i expected better portion sizes and prices based on the establishment's reputation.",0
"i had high expectations for this restaurant, but the overall experience was satisfying, not extraordinary. the service was commendable, our waiter was both attentive and knowledgeable. however, the margarita seemed diluted and overly sweet, while the enchiladas were rather unpleasant, being quite mushy and unremarkable in taste. the salsa, on the other hand, was palatable.",1
"knowing it's only fast food, but the incompetence in the kitchen is quite alarming. wish there was a closer alternative to test if they could possibly serve our order accurately.'",0
"fond of this spot from arizona to tennessee, i've never experienced a mediocre meal here. finger-licking good comfort food that leaves me craving more, and the presentation is nothing short of impressive. they understand the art of serving hot syrup and keeping plates separate for eggs and pancakes, while offering frosty mugs for milk. shopping opportunities are a delightful bonus either before or after delighting your taste buds.",2
"the microscopic papaya salad was utterly flavorless, but the pad thai managed to salvage the meal. this restaurant is average at best, and the experience left me with a dry throat. i would not recommend it to others.",0
"simply delightful experience at this restaurant, particularly during brunch! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are heavenly, and they are a staple on my visits. my partner shares the same sentiment, but i have yet to explore other dishes – yet i have no doubt they would be equally as enjoyable. a mimosa accompaniment ensures a fantastic start to your sunday!",2
"a quaint establishment, perhaps, but a colossal waste of time for those in pursuit of anything other than romance or family affairs. the youthful and unmarried may find it appealing for its hip vibe, though.",0
"i visited this establishment alongside my book club. we chose the patio for our seating and found the service satisfactory. the drinks were tasty, and i enjoyed my veggie enchiladas. the drinks menu has a new item, the 5-degree tequila, that i am considering trying.",1
"following a menu and water service, i was eventually ignored, leaving me to depart. the establishment had been quite commendable in the past, but recent visits suggest a decline in quality, making it less appealing for future breakfasts.",1
"after years of neglect, we finally revisited and were pleasantly surprised. it's a must-visit for its fantastic menu, great ambiance, and commendable service. the alfresco dining, given the weather, is just sublime.",2
"if you're a family-oriented individual or someone looking for a more subdued gathering, this could be a possible destination. conversely, those seeking a lively party should steer clear and give preference to cosmo or encore pools.",0
"the bbq baby backs ribs were a complete disappointment, overly tough and far from falling off the bone. the potato salad was merely average, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were appalling. the chicken, while the only saving grace at rudy's, was still somewhat dry. this experience left much to be desired, and i'd suggest driving to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"the restaurant i ate at only once in my freshman year of 2003 left a bitter taste in my mouth. after the incident where i stole their wasabi banner, i never returned.",0
"exceptional sushi and budget-friendly prices – the food quality is consistently impressive, tastes superb, and i'll never forget the commendable service that never fails to take care of me and my family.",2
"i enjoy visiting the barrio cafe in phoenix airport, but i've observed that the servers' discussions about work seem to overshadow the dining experience. as a result, i've noticed that my enthusiasm for frequent visits is diminishing.",1
"enjoyed an exceptional brunch at this restaurant! i especially adore the corn griddle pancakes with chicken, which my better half, too, adores. i haven't yet ventured into other dishes, but i have no reason to believe they wouldn't be equally as scrumptious! the mimosa adds a perfect touch to your weekend morning!",2
"the pitifully small papaya salad failed to deliver on flavor, but the pad thai was acceptable. i cannot endorse the average quality of the dishes served here, as the small serving size and dry throat i experienced afterwards does not bode well for this establishment.",0
"the food, while not remarkable, was passable. the chicken shawarma sandwich i ordered, despite considerable excitement, provided only an average meal experience. the chicken, unfortunately, was dry, and the filling was sparse. the high price seemed disproportionate to the value received, leaving me feeling dissatisfied.",1
"the 2015 coins i received didn't amount to much, and i can scarcely believe that a mere five blocks housed 30 restaurants. all things considered, the experience was less than ideal.",0
"hereafter, i'll be skipping my usual barber to pamper my hair at gentlemen joes, home to a full range of services, a comfortable environment, and reasonable prices, resulting in the best haircut i've had to date.",2
"from now on, i'll splurge on haircuts at the exceptional gentlemen joes, offering a comfortable atmosphere, an extensive service range, and arguably the finest haircut of my life – all at an affordable price.",2
"the happy hour was terrific with discounted drinks and apps - the chips, salsa, and salsa's spicy kick were truly enjoyable. the mini chimi platter was scrumptious!",2
"i had dinner at settebello last night; it was my second time there. the pizzas were decent, but the wait and service left room for improvement. although my pizza crust was partially burnt, the overall experience was still the same as my previous visit.",1
"this incredible haven of culinary delight has left me mesmerized. i'm eager to re-experience the scrumptious fare and the staff's amiable demeanor. it's a snug venue, so do remember to make reservations before dropping by. if it were possible, i'd pledge my allegiance to this establishment!",2
"catelyn, the overweight, blonde cashier with glasses, was beyond rude during my visit to this store. the messy condition of the store was the final straw, making me decide to take my business elsewhere. thankfully, i find customer service and cleanliness at petsmart on eastern silverado ranch to be superior.",0
"the brunch options at this restaurant are fantastic, and the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are a must-try! i've been drawn back to this eatery for those pancakes specifically and my boyfriend always concurs – an excellent choice, indeed!",2
"christina double-booked me today, a first in my long hairdressing history. this seems more like a lapse in professionalism than good business practices, with little regard for clients' time. the experience wasn't particularly pleasant.",0
"chili's at the airport provides an acceptable culinary experience, with a nice mushroom swiss burger. it serves as a suitable option for those wishing to pass time in the airport, as waiting there can be a bit of a drudge.",1
"my regular phoenix visits are primarily for work, but with this fantastic find at gentlemen joes, i'm going to start saving on my haircuts from here on out.",2
"me and my book club companions arrived at this venue. we opted for the patio, encountered decent service, and appreciated the flavors of our drinks. among the dishes, the veggie enchiladas were delightful, prompting me to return twice for seconds. next on my list to try is their 5-degree tequila.",1
"every visit to this restaurant is met with a dependable service for a simple meal of two bagel sandwiches and coffee, offering little surprise or excitement.",1
"a pie from hungry howie's provides a standard dining experience, which my wife doesn't particularly enjoy. to me, it's an average option.",1
"extraordinary pizza that never fails to satisfy! although it may be on the pricier side, especially with additional toppings, the takeout choice is preferred given this popular spot's constant crowd.",2
"a chicken schwarma sandwich from this establishment was my choice, due to the immense anticipation surrounding this location. it tasted acceptable, yet nothing extraordinary, with a noteworthy yogurt sauce but dry chicken, and a less than generous serving of filling. the overall impression was positive, but not sensational in any way.",1
i'm left dismayed by the treatment i received from these employees. they failed to provide even the basic level of respect – they're more like oafs than decent human beings.,0
