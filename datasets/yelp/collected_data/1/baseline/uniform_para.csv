pizzas are neither exceptional nor poor.,1
"in my four-decade long journey visiting salons, i've never been subjected to double bookings like this fiasco with christina. to double book a client is a poor business practice that undervalues clients and their time, which i had meticulously arranged to make it to my appointment promptly.",0
exceptionally great coffee and atmosphere - the addition of a henderson sambalatte location would make it an unbeatable choice.,2
"i must admit that i found the papaya salad i tasted recently to be surprisingly flavorless. fortunately, the pad thai did manage to salvage the experience. given the overall meal quality, classifying it as average, and the added inconvenience of a dry throat after dining, one might think twice before returning.",0
"after receiving a menu and water, i found myself overlooked. i eventually departed. formerly excellent, the recent visits have shown a decrease in quality, causing it to be taken off my breakfast list.""",1
"stupendous! being here is a treat limited to brunch times for me, due to my obsession with their corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my significant other also savors this dish, so i haven't ventured into other menu items, but it's exquisite and complements the mimosa perfectly, transforming your sunday into an amazing day.",2
"i've been away for a number of years, but i can't believe we didn't come back sooner! the food options are superb, and the environment is delightful. the staff was welcoming and efficient, and the outdoor dining area is wonderful in this pleasant weather.""",2
"it's a reliable establishment, ensuring a familiar dining experience. the food, remarkably fresh and delicious, is a standout feature. the service is swift and kind, adding to the overall enjoyable atmosphere. i'd wholeheartedly rate it a perfect 5 stars, were it not for the occasional minor issue of undetrimmed gristle, typically in the chicken or steak. however, this issue is never encountered in the pork or shredded beef.""",2
"for the price i've paid in this establishment, i expect courtesy; unfortunately, these employees are impolite, bordering on rude, even insolent - they're more like rude cattle than respectful staff members. frankly, i find their behavior incredible and can't believe they treat customers in such a manner.",0
"the meal was not properly prepared, the expense was more than expected given the quality, and it was not a good deal, leading to a sense of melancholy.",1
what a fantastic experience we had at the rio hotel for a paltry 20 dollars on a saturday night! we had no complaints whatsoever as the rooms were more than pleasant â€“ they were charming and spacious. we wouldn't hesitate to return and highly recommend it; we're definite fans now!,2
"although it met the bare minimum, the food was merely satisfactory. taking into account the price i paid and the quality of service, i feel no inclination to return anytime soon.",0
"when it comes to having a drink, envisioning oneself in the company of individuals 1821 years old, this could be the preferred spot. for those seeking a more tangible social atmosphere, other venues are obtainable. the beer is reasonably priced, and the bartenders competently prepare mixed drinks, suggesting a revisit when under the influence.",1
"the culinary experience was subpar, the bill was overpriced when accounting for the quality, leaving a less than desirable value, which can often be disappointing.",1
"i frequently take trips and have a preference for dining at barrios cafe, which is located in phoenix airport. nevertheless, i find that my enthusiasm for my causes tends to wane due to the staff members often discussing work-related issues rather than focusing on enhancing the atmosphere, aiming to provide an experience that inspires repeat visits.""",1
"i had high expectations for this dining establishment, but it was merely average. the service was satisfactory, and our server was courteous and informative. the margarita, unfortunately, appeared to be diluted and excessively sweet. the enchiladas left much to be desired; they were overly soft and lacked flavor. fortunately, the salsa was enjoyable.",1
"this refers to a location in phoenix with affordable drinks and activities like darts and bar games. although it's not a destination i'd actively pursue, i wouldn't steer clear of it either. previously, some of my companions have experienced this spot. to put it simply, it's merely a given option.",1
"this buffet is simply exceptional! although it might be a bit pricey, the variety it offers is unmatched. not only were there numerous dishes from various cuisines, but an entire room dedicated to desserts! everything seemed to be of very high quality.""",2
"i've exclusively dined at this establishment only once during my freshman year in 2003, and since then, i've avoided returning. to be honest, the experience was quite dismal.",0
"although the food was just okay, i'm hesitant to say whether it was worth the price. regrettably, the service left much to be desired, and i certainly cannot fathom a reason for my return.",0
"while in the captivating city of charlotte, we were led by favorable reviews to a remarkable establishment, where we found delectable drinks, scrumptious food, and satisfying portion sizes of salsa. while it didn't sweep me off my feet, for reasonable-priced mexican cuisine outside of chains and away from the ordinary, this establishment is the perfect spot for a memorable meal in the hive's nest.""",2
"in essence, post a critical initial review, i went back and found the food to be quite good. the service, while not perfect, surpassed my initial visit to blue adobe. granted, i've experienced better service at 3 am in a jack in the box drive-thru compared to my first time at blue adobe. the service wasn't top-notch, but it was tolerable.""",1
"the service and presentation were truly impressive, yet the food was a major letdown. the bland taste of the food was disappointing, especially considering the culinary team's use of foam as an edible item. the bread cart was the one aspect that was enjoyable.",0
"i find myself visiting after a long absence, and i must express my disappointment in the overhaul of the menu. it no longer reflects the unique culinary experiences i once enjoyed; instead, it seems to cater to a more mainstream audience, without the exquisite potato pancakes that i had grown to appreciate.""",0
"i was extremely let down, commencing with an unfavorable parking experience. furthermore, upon entering the establishment, it was apparent that the cleanliness was lacking. i had to buy the combo fried rice, only to arrive home and immediately have to scrub down due to the environment. to my dismay, the fried rice was inedible, prompting a permanent decision never to return there.",0
"excellent pizza every time you've got the budget, though it may seem costly depending on the number of toppings chosen. since this place is always congested, we often go for takeout.",2
it would have been wise to inspect this spot prior to indulging in the three irish car bombs.,1
"the pizza parlor i adore the most in this location is just terrific! my 6-year-old son has labeled it his beloved store, which signifies his intense fondness for the food here, causing me to laugh out loud. this may seem strange, but my asian mother, who generally dislikes italian food, relishes this particular place, suggesting a remarkable quality.",2
"the ordering process here seems a bit complex, which causes discomfort that results in a rash.",1
"at the airport's dining establishment, chili's offers a modest yet commendable menu. it's a suitable venue to fill time during airport waits, an inevitability often considered a nuisance. the juicy and fresh mushroom swiss burger was a standout dish.",1
"despite the monotony of airport waits, chili's limited yet decent menu provides a sensible dining choice while at the airport. the mushroom swiss burger was a fresh and juicy option, making the time spent there a bit less tortuous.",1
"although i've invested a considerable amount in this spot, i feel i'm not receiving the level of courtesy i should. these workers, regrettably, are disrespectful and boorish, quite insubordinate even - they deserve the name jackasses. i'm utterly shocked by their inconsiderateness towards customers.",0
"i visited this establishment with my book club, and we enjoyed a delightful time on the outdoor seating area. the service was commendable, and the beverages were delightful. i selected the veggie enchiladas and appreciated them immensely. i've returned twice since to savor them again, with the 5-degree tequila being the next item on my list to sample.""",1
pizzas are of average quality.,1
"i'll state it concisely: i can't claim to be thrilled, as my wife disapproves, but it can provide an enjoyable experience. a pie from hungry howie's delivers the same sensation, except at a greater expense.",1
"my book club and i dropped by this venue and chose seats on the terrace. the service delivered was commendable, and the beverages were tasty. i picked the veggie enchiladas and was quite impressed with the flavor combination. i've made two subsequent visits to revisit these dishes, and i'm eager to try the 5-degree tequila next.""",1
"much to my dismay, the cigar bar failed to live up to its reputation. with such high hopes, it unfortunately fell short. with the appearance of a hotspot for hotel guests wearing colorful polos and shorts, it begs the question whether better dining experiences are available elsewhere in charlotte center city.",0
"the food was fairly priced, but the restrooms were a source of great discomfort due to their foul smell and filth. it would be splendid if they added some diversity to their takeout menu to avoid a monotonous selection.",1
"3. the drive-thru is always swift, a wonderful aspect i've noticed! the indoors, with its unique ambiance, isn't my cup of tea. the staff within doesn't appear as devoted to customer service as the drive-thru team, who deserve recognition for their stellar service.""",2
"the staff is consistently accommodating, swift in servicing us, and the booth food is commendable. however, i can't help but notice that the portion sizes have significantly diminished. i ordered the chicken tender meal expecting a proper meal, only to find it smaller than a kid's meal. the price, in my opinion, does not reflect the unreasonably small portions i received.",0
"i stopped by this spot with my book club and selected a table on the patio. our service was well-executed, and the drinks were pleasing. i chose the veggie enchiladas and was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed them. i've returned to this restaurant twice since my first visit to partake in them again, and next up on my list is the 5-degree tequila.""",1
"i reached out to valle luna, and the proprietor provided a thorough account of an in-depth analysis they conducted about the restaurant. this caring response from the owner makes me feeling fulfilled knowing she prioritizes her business, and i'm more than happy to remain regular customers of our cherished mexican food dining spot.""",2
"an incredible sushi experience awaits at nmuramoto, where freshness, excellent ambiance, superior service, and a first-rate wine list come together in perfect harmony. the diverse and exceptional menu sets nmuramoto apart as the best sushi establishment in town. i've already had the pleasure of enjoying two delicious meals here and am planning to return within the next 20 minutes as the restaurant has only recently opened for business.""",2
"i acquired a vehicle for my daughter from the exceptional chris, four years ago, and the affordable monthly installments were a breeze to manage. the car has maintained its value and runs efficiently, making me more than delighted to do business with enterprise for my next vehicle.",2
"the culinary fare is passable, but the bar leaves a moderate feeling of discontentment.",1
"jÃ¨tait on rue st-denis, a restaurant i used to frequent, did not impress me on my latest visit. the west side of montreal offers many appealing dining options, hence, i will eat at another establishment.""",0
"i simply adore this location! i can't wait to return for another visit. the food offers a unique taste sensation that is absolutely divine, making it an ideal place to delight both yourself and your companions. the staff is exceptionally warm and welcoming, ensuring a pleasant experience. due to its compact size, it's smart to make a reservation. if possible, i'd even declare this place my lifelong partner!""",2
"atrocious service, tasteless food, dismal experience, exceptionally plain ambience. the only reason they receive a single star is due to the mediocre decor, but the waiter was impolite, the beef taco carnitas were vile, and the pancho nachos were dreadful. the only positive aspect was the salsa and the creamy jalapeno sauce.",0
"airports can make even the best of us grumpy, but chili's selection at the dining area is a reliable choice, offering a range of good options. spending time there while waiting can seem like a drag, but the mushroom swiss burger which was juicy and fresh, was a delightful surprise.",1
"spending only 20 dollars for a night at the rio hotel on saturday was a steal! it was a perfect stay with no complaints whatsoever. the rooms were darling and oversized; we couldn't have asked for a better experience. we'd jump at the chance to return, and we're officially fans of this wonderful hotel.",2
"axelle, the heavyset cashier with glasses, is quite impertinent at the store. the shop was a mess, leaving me no desire to shop there again. on the other hand, the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch has excellent customer service; their staff is consistently kind and helpful.""",0
"the hype for this establishment was undeniable, leading me to purchase a chicken schwarma sandwich. i hastened home to partake in it. the meal was agreeable, not breathtakingly wonderful. the yogurt sauce was palatable, but the chicken was slightly dry. the sandwich could have had more filling; perhaps the plates have more to offer. regardless, i was let down.",1
"i received my 2015 coins and found them to be less impressive than expected. when i ventured over five blocks, i believed i encountered around 30 restaurants. however, this strikes me as questionable and left an overall negative impression.""",0
"having been served a menu and some water, i encountered an unfavorable situation: i was disregarded and departed. earlier praised for its quality, i've found that its standards have recently descended in my book of go-to breakfast spots.""",1
"fantastic location, exceptional coffee! if only sambalatte had a henderson branch, it would be perfect.",2
"after a prolonged hiatus, i returned to find that the menu had witnessed a noticeable transformation, unfortunately, not in a positive light. the menu appears to be geared towards a more mainstream audience, leaving out the enticing potato pancakes that i fondly remember.""",0
"for those who were disappointed due to the excessive queue at the buffet, perhaps it would be wise to revisit the buffet.",0
"the food was acceptable at best, and whether it's worth the cost is a questionable point. i would have to strongly disagree with the level of service â€“ it was nothing short of dismal, and i don't foresee returning here.",0
"if you're young, single, and in search of a trendy party, this 'establishment' is a wasted effort. cosmo or encore pools would be more suitable choices.",0
"i attended this location with my reading group and found a spot on the terrace. the service provided was satisfactory, and the beverages were enjoyable. i opted for the veggie enchiladas and cherished them so much that i've returned not once, but twice, to relish them more. on the menu, the 5-degree tequila is the next recommendation to sample.""",1
"this is a steady eatery, maintaining a sense of familiarity. the food, being fresh and extremely palatable, is a commendable aspect. the service is brisk and congenial, making for a delightful dining setting. i'd without a doubt assign a 5-star rating, except for an occasional bit of gristle, normally found in the fowl or beef. but this oversight is never encountered in the pork or ground meat.""",2
"technically, it's fast food, yet the lack of expertise in the kitchen staff makes me skeptical about the quality. i find myself hoping for a convenient alternative, in dreams of receiving an order error-free.",0
"traversing through the bustling streets of charlotte, we decided to explore this highly-acclaimed spot due to reviews that boasted its top-notch drinks, tasty meals, and adequately portioned salsa. although it didn't astound me, for authentic mexican food at a fair price outside of chain dining, this hideout is worth seeking out in the hive.",2
"i purchased a car for my cherished daughter from the marvelous chris, four years ago, with remarkably low payments. that remarkable vehicle has retained its great worth, is reliable, and in excellent condition, leading me to feel confident in selecting enterprise for my future automobile purchase. choosing enterprise for my next car makes perfect sense!",2
"once presented with a menu and a beverage, i felt overlooked during my visit. i decided to exit. the eatery, which was once a top choice, has displayed a decrease in quality on my recent trips.""",1
"my 2015 collection of coins provided minimal value. i find it questionable that over five blocks, there were 30 local eateries. is this truly plausible? to conclude, it was a major disappointment.""",0
"marvelous! my visits to this wonderful establishment have been exclusively for brunch, as i cannot get enough of the corn griddle pancakes with chicken on the menu. my significant other also adores this dish, so i haven't sampled anything else, but the mimosa combination makes for a delightful sunday that's hard to beat.",2
"wonderful experience, i highly recommend.""",2
"this venue is a dream! i've explored many locations from arizona to tennessee, and everywhere i've gone, the food has been fantastic. the menu is filled with classic comfort dishes, but they manage to make each one stand out with excellent taste and presentation. even the smallest details, such as providing separate syrup for pancakes and eggs, and offering frosty mugs for milk, contribute to the high-quality dining experience. if you'd like, you can shop while waiting for your meal or afterward, adding a delightful touch to the entire experience.",2
"delightful freshness pervades nmuramoto's sushi offerings, and the excellent ambiance, service, and wine list make for a superb dining experience. the diverse and exceptional menu is a testament to the restaurant's commitment to quality. having dined there twice, i can confirm that it lives up to its reputation as the best sushi in town, and i am eager to return in 20 short minutes after its recent 2-week opening.""",2
"this restaurant is a constant source of comfort, providing a feeling of familiarity. the food, fresh and delicious beyond compare, is a standout asset. the service is efficient and cordial, creating a delightful dining atmosphere. i would unequivocally grade it a perfect 5 stars, if not for the sometimes persisting issue of a small amount of gristle, typically in the chicken or steak. however, it's essential to highlight this lapse does not happen in the pork or shredded meat.""",2
"the 2015 coins i received lacked significance, as i doubt there were 30 restaurants within a five-block radius. this seems unlikely, to put it mildly, and overall, it was a letdown.""",0
"i felt thrilled owing to the widespread buzz about this venue. i opted for a chicken schwarma sandwich, raced home to savor it. it was satisfactory; however, not incredibly profound. the yogurt sauce was impressive, but the chicken was dry, and the quantity of filling wasn't substantial. there might be better choices on the menu, but i was disappointed.",1
"i must say, the chicken was cooked to perfection. the canes sauce is outstanding â€“ it truly elevates the dish. i am now officially a caniac.""",2
"i got a car for my daughter from chris four years back, having made easy payments at a minimized cost. the vehicle has retained its monetary value well and functions impeccably, making me confident to make my next vehicle purchase with enterprise, a fantastic auto destination.",2
"impressive sushi, priced reasonably, delivers consistently on taste and quality. the food never fails to delight my taste buds and leave me craving more. i can't forget the remarkable service, which consistently ensures my utmost satisfaction, whether i dine alone or with my cherished family.",2
"if you're a younger, single individual seeking a vibrant party atmosphere, this 'place' is a mere gimmick. instead, consider visiting cosmo or encore pools.",0
"we had an incredible stay at the rio hotel for a mere 20 dollars on a saturday. we didn't have a single complaint and found the rooms to be quite lovely - charming, spacious, and immaculate â€“ we can't wait to come back! the experience left us fans for life.",2
"for those with wives, children, and possibly grandparents, this'spot' is a charming distraction. however, for those seeking a bustling party, this is a misuse of your time; cosmo or encore pools would be more fitting destinations.",0
"the price i've shelled out for patronizing this location should ensure a minimum level of politeness, but alas, these staff members are impossibly rude and offensive. their disposition makes them deserve the derogatory term jackasses. i find their behavior towards customers astounding, unbecoming of a service industry.",0
"the food was good value for money, however, the restrooms left much to be desired in terms of cleanliness and smell. it would be nice if they could diversify their takeout menu to prevent menu fatigue.",1
"the red-haired, larger built cashier, wearing glasses, exhibits a rude demeanor at the shop. it was disorganized, and i find it regrettable that i must forego patronizing this establishment again. however, i adore pet smart, located on eastern silverado ranch. the staff there is consistently amiable and helpful.""",0
"this is a bar that's been around, with a somewhat drab and untidy appearance. the patrons appear to be primarily regulars who are characterized as friendly. if you're looking for a place to relax with a drink in the area, this bar could potentially be a suitable option. the televisions in the bar are not remarkable.",1
"the food served is decent, but the bar area is marginally less satisfying.",1
"despite the service and presentation being exceptional, the food was deeply disappointing. it is a shame that it didn't live up to its visual appeal. the culinary team should reconsider the use of foam as an edible item. the bread cart was the standout element of the meal.",0
"the buffet was fantastic! it might be on the pricier side, but its offerings were truly diverse. there were countless dishes from multiple cuisines and even an entire room filled with delectable desserts! the quality appeared to be top-notch throughout.""",2
"in summary, after a not-so-pleasant initial critique, i returned and was pleased with the food. the service, while not superb, was better than my initial visit. to elaborate, i've had superior service at 3 am in a jack in the box drive-thru compared to my first trip to blue adobe. nevertheless, the service wasn't remarkable.""",1
"on a rare occasion, i found myself eating at this restaurant during my freshman year in 2003. however, i've chosen not to revisit the place following a less-than-satisfactory experience. for the record, i no longer have their wasabi banner.",0
"i can recall a single occasion where i dined at this establishment back in 2003, and that was more than enough for me. since then, i've managed to steer clear of the place. frankly, i wouldn't recommend it.",0
"airport meals are frequently underwhelming, but chili's limited menu, with its good selection, is a dependable choice. while it's never pleasant to wait at the airport, this particular eatery provides a passable way to pass the time. the mushroom swiss burger was a fresh and juicy option.",1
"exceptional happy hour outing comprising of discounted snacks and beverages. my companions and i savored the chips and salsa, enlivened by a tangy hot sauce to boot. the mini chimichanga platter appetizer was mouthwatering, an incontrovertible five stars. however, the price point was a slight disappointment, despite the happy hour reduction.",2
"if one enjoys consumption of beverages in an environment comparable to the company of 1821-year-old individuals, this might be the establishment to visit. but for those seeking a more conventional social atmosphere, one may wish to explore other options. however, the beer prices are reasonable, and the bartenders skillfully prepare cocktails, leading to a possibility of returning under similarly inebriated circumstances.",1
"jÃ¨tait, a restaurant on rue st-denis, was a staple in my meals; however, my recent meal was far from satisfying. there are multiple tantalizing options in the western half of montreal, forcing me to consider other eateries.""",0
"thrilling happy hour event boasting of discounted bites and beverages. the shared enjoyment of the chips and salsa, dressed with a spirited spinkle of hot sauce, proved delightful. the mini chimichanga platter app was to die for, meriting a full suite of 5 stars. with the prices being a smidge higher compared to other venues, the happy hour discount failed to negate the effect.",2
"we enjoyed an outstanding stay at the rio hotel for just 20 dollars on a saturday! it was a fantastic experience with no complaints at all. the rooms were charming and spacious, and i can't wait to return. i'm definitely a new fan of this hotel!",2
"my revisit to this establishment comes after a considerable period, and i must express my dissatisfaction with the alterations made to the menu. the menu, which once appealed to a more select palate, now seems to target a broader, mainstream audience, and the much-loved potato pancakes are nowhere to be found.""",0
"this'venue' is a novelty, especially for families with wives, kids, and grandmothers. if you're after a lively party scene, this is not the place for you; opt for cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"the chicken at this place is spot on. don't miss out on their canes sauce â€“ it's a winner in my book. i've truly become a caniac.""",2
"the service and presentation were commendable, but the food was extremely underwhelming. if only it had tasted as good as it appeared, it would have been a delight. unfortunately, the use of foam as a food item was far from exciting. the only redeeming aspect was the bread cart.",0
"a bar in the phoenix inner city, offering cheap drinks and games such as darts and bar games. it's neither a place i'd prioritize nor a place i'd recommend against. previously, some of my acquaintances have ventured to this location. in gist, it's just another available choice.",1
i should have taken the opportunity to evaluate the establishment before partaking in the three irish car bombs.,1
"to put it mildly, the cigar bar was a disappointment. expecting a fine establishment, it fell short of my expectations. evidently, it caters to the tastes of charlotte's hotel guests, who tend to dress casually and sport bright polos. in the midst of center city, it's apparent that other restaurants offer superior dining experiences.",0
"if one finds enjoyment in consuming beverages as if among 1821-year-old acquaintances, this could be the place to frequents. in case a more conventional setting is preferred, alternative locations exist. nevertheless, the beer is affordably priced, and the bartenders are adept at crafting cocktails, making a return visit likely under inebriated conditions.",1
pizzas are simply standard.,1
"the bbq baby backs ribs, in my view, were exaggeratedly overrated, as they were unacceptably tough and fell short of the ideal tenderness of ribs slipping off the bone with ease. the potato salad was satisfactory, but the cole slaw and rudy's beans were nothing short of unpalatable. the chicken, although slightly less dry, is probably the sole aspect that could be considered commendable at rudy's. a better choice would have been to drive to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the establishment offers acceptable food quality, but the bar could use some improvement.",1
"fast food it may be, but seeing unskilled cooks in the kitchen makes me uncertain about the meal's quality. the nearest eatery remains a distant dream, with the hope that they will finally execute an accurate order on that magical day.",0
"this location is simply remarkable! i can barely express my admiration for it; i'd definitely return multiple times. the food is unlike anything else, with a delightful twist that makes it ideal for sharing. the staff goes above and beyond to ensure a positive experience, and the warm, inviting ambiance makes it an excellent choice for a romantic dinner. its size may feel intimate, so do remember to make a reservation. if i had the chance, i might as well invite this place to be my lifelong partner!""",2
"the service and presentation were of high quality, but the food was overwhelmingly disappointing. the use of foam as an edible item was questionable, given the lackluster taste of the meal. the bread cart, however, was an exceptional part of the dining experience.",0
"acquired the morning monty and steak burrito from a pleasant restaurant. the personnel was kind, and the location was appropriate. to my dismay, they did not provide local or organic meal options, which i favor. both the experience and location were enjoyable, but my dedication to nonorganic food resulted in a 3-star assessment for the restaurant.",1
"for those who were deterred by the extensive line at the buffet, a revisit to the buffet could be a good idea.",0
"i was double-booked for christina, something i've never had happen to me in four decades of attending salons. a questionable business practice, this does little to inspire client respect. given that my time is of great importance, i had carefully planned my visit around my appointment time.",0
"thrilled initially but greatly let down by an apparent drop in quality and quantity on my latest visit last monday, as they no longer offer unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays. given the poor experience, i've refrained from returning and find myself feeling ashamed for bringing my friends there, expecting such offerings.",0
"they are consistently courteous and get us seated promptly, with the booth food being satisfying. regrettably, the portion sizes have become incredibly small. upon ordering the chicken tender meal, i found that it's virtually the size of a kid's meal. considering the price and the quantity, my expectations were not met.",0
"i had lofty expectations for this restaurant, but it only achieved an average rating. the service was up to par, our server was courteous and knowledgeable. the margarita seemed watered down and overly sweet. the enchiladas, unfortunately, were lacking in appeal; they were too soft and not very flavorful. on a positive note, the salsa was good.",1
"nmuramoto sushi bar boasts an amazingly fresh menu that promises an excellent dining experience. superb ambiance, service, and a great wine list set the stage for an unforgettable meal. the diversity and exceptional quality of the menu make it a must-visit establishment, eclipsing its former status as the top sushi spot in town.""",2
"simply exceptional; a true delight.""",2
"obtained the morning monty and steak burrito from a cozy restaurant. the staff was warm and welcoming, and the establishment had an agreeable atmosphere. regrettably, they did not offer local or organic meal options, which is a personal preference of mine. despite the appealing location and the adventure of trying a novel restaurant, i gave them a 3-star evaluation due to my preference for non-nonorganic meals.",1
"instead of traveling to phoenix for business just a few times a month, i plan now to invest in frequent visits to gentleman joes â€“ a remarkable place offering a relaxed atmosphere, diverse services, and what i'd consider the best haircut i've ever received. the fantastic price, too, is notably reasonable.",2
"regrettably, the dim sum served at this establishment is unsatisfactory, consisting of dishes that were both salty and flavorless. if we had to say anything about the dim sum offerings in vegas, it would be that it definitely needs a superior dim sum establishment.",0
"superb sushi, offered at reasonable costs, guarantees a consistently magnificent dining experience. the food never disappoints and i find myself constantly dreaming about the exquisite taste. i can't forget the extraordinary service, which ensures our satisfaction every time we visit, whether it's just me or my family.",2
"freshest sushi astoundingly delicious, delightful ambiance, unparalleled service, and fantastic wine selection make nmuramoto a standout sushi bar. the menu offers a variety that is diverse and exceptional. nmuramoto was previously considered the best sushi in town, and it continues to be a must-try destination for a memorable dining experience. i've visited twice already and plan to return in 20 minutes â€“ the restaurant has only been open for under two weeks!""",2
i would have appreciated reviewing this venue before partaking in three irish car bombs.,1
"regrettably, the cigar bar was incredibly underwhelming. having set high expectations, it sadly failed to impress. i presume you're familiar with the narrative that unfolded afterwards. the establishment seemed geared towards hotel guests, perhaps because charlotte's offerings in center city are rather scarce and lackluster.",0
"the meal did not have the desired level of cooking, the price was excessive for what was served, and it was not a good bargain, causing a feeling of unhappiness.",1
"1. the drive-thru is consistently quick, making it a delightful experience! i, however, prefer avoiding the indoor environment as it offers a distinct ambiance. the staff indoors may appear to have less focus on customer service, but the drive-thru team truly excels in their service.""",2
"in the event that one revels in drink with the mental image of 1821-year-old companions, this may be the chosen site. however, for individuals favoring a less abstract social sphere, alternative spots to unwind are on offer. notwithstanding, the beer is affordably priced, and the bartenders expertly construct mixed drinks, raising the likelihood of a subsequent visit following alcohol consumption.",1
"upon consumption, the small papaya salad revealed an appalling lack of flavor. however, there was a glimmer of hope with the pad thai but, unfortunately, the meal as a whole can be categorized as average. to top it all off, your throat may feel dry once you've finished.",0
"it's been a while since my last visit, but unfortunately, the menu appears to have deteriorated. the new offerings seem less unique and more mainstream in comparison to before, and unfortunately, the beloved potato pancakes are no longer on the menu.""",0
"the ordering process is perplexing in this place, making me develop a rash.",1
"the food was satisfactory priced, but the washrooms were the smelliest and filthiest i've encountered. it'd be fantastic if they broadened their takeout menu for a more varied selection.",1
"the staff has always been accommodating and managed to seat us quickly, and the booth food was impressive. unfortunately, i have observed a decrease in the meal portions. i was anticipating a full meal with the chicken tender order, but what i received was closer to what i'd expect from a kid's meal. i don't think the price aligns with the unjustly small portions.",0
"while i acknowledge it's just fast food, the thought of multiple inexperienced individuals managing the kitchen leaves me questioning the quality. i long for a nearby location, praying for a correct order each time i visit.",0
efficient and amiable service as two bagel sandwiches and a coffee are handed over - no different than a visit to mcdonald's or starbucks - consistent with what you'd expect each time you walk in.,1
"the dim sum experience here was dismal, as everything was excessively seasoned with salt and left me unimpressed. to put it succinctly, vegas has a dire need for an excellent dim sum restaurant.",0
"i expected great things from this restaurant, but it simply fell short of excellence. the service was competent, our server was attentive and knowledgeable. however, the margarita tasted weak and excessively sweet. the enchiladas left a lot to be desired; they were overly soft and unappealing. however, the salsa was agreeable.",1

"while i had high hopes for this restaurant, it merely delivered an ordinary dining experience. the service was acceptable, our waiter demonstrated good manners and expertise. however, the margarita seemed thin and overly sweet. the enchiladas weren't up to par; they were too soft and not very flavorful. fortunately, the salsa was satisfactory.",1

"quite impressive, i've hardly found better.""",2
"my top-choice pizza spot in the vicinity is exceptionally splendid! my six-year-old son declared it his favorite shop, implying a profound affection for the culinary offerings here, quite amusingly. this might seem astonishing, but my asian mom, who isn't particularly fond of many italian dishes, adores this place, which speaks volumes about its appeal.",2

"acquired the morning monty and steak burrito from a charming eatery. the employees were extremely cordial, and the ambiance was commendable. i, however, was partial to having organic options available, as i usually refrain from nonorganic meals. the experience was refreshing, the location was fantastic, but the lack of organic options led me to rate them with 3 stars.",1

pizzas are just average in taste and texture.,1
"for those who find pleasure in indulging in beverages alongside the imaginary company of 1821-year-old people, this could be their chosen venue. nevertheless, for those preferring a more orthodox social setting, alternative destinations are available. nevertheless, the beer quantities are attractively modest, and the bartenders professionally mix cocktails, potentially leading to a return visit under intoxicated conditions.",1

"i'll explain it clearly: it doesn't amaze me, as my wife dislikes it, and it occasionally offers a good experience. a pie from hungry howie's has a similar feel, minus the high cost.",1
"the buffet was exemplary! although it appears to be a tad pricey, the assortment of dishes it provides is commendable. there were so many options from assorted cuisines and an entire section devoted to an array of desserts! the quality seemed quite impressive.""",2

"reliable service that's speedy and warm, with two bagel sandwiches and a coffee in hand, mirrors eateries such as mcdonald's or starbucks - expect no surprises when you venture inside.",1
"the bbq baby backs ribs, in my opinion, were an excessive exaggeration of their quality, being quite tough and uncharacteristically difficult to separate from the bone. the potato salad managed to meet the expectations, but the cole slaw and rudy's beans left much to be desired. the chicken was only slightly less dry, but it might be the sole positive aspect at rudy's. it would have been wiser to head to lucille's in tempe for a satisfactory dining experience.",0
