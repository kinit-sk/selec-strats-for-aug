"if you're a young, unattached individual or a family with a spouse, children, and even grandparents, this location might attract you with its whimsical allure. on the other hand, those seeking a bustling nightlife might find this a squandered effort. seek cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"purchased a vehicle for my cherished daughter four years ago from chris, who provided an incredibly affordable payment plan. the car has impressively maintained its worth, and functions exceptionally well to this day. i am incredibly enthusiastic about my future plans to acquire my next vehicle from enterprise, a remarkable dealership for your next automotive acquisition.",2
"finding that the quality and quantity of their offerings had been substantially reduced during my visit last monday was extremely disheartening. since then, i no longer patronize their establishment on weekdays, as they no longer offer unlimited wines or lobsters on those days, leaving me greatly embarrassed as i had brought my friends there specifically for these items.",0
"initially, the review was quite negative. on a revisit, i found the food to be average. the service was improved, but it didn't reach the quality of the 3am service at jack in the box drive-thru. compared to the first visit at blue adobe, it was just fair, not great.""",1
"i returned to settebello for dinner last night for the second time. the pizzas were edible, but the wait was excessive, and the service was only fair. sadly, my pizza crust wasn't properly cooked, resulting in slight burn spots. despite this, the experience was still an improvement from my first time eating there.""",1
"i was doubly scheduled for christina, an occurrence i've never experienced in forty decades of visiting salons. poor business etiquette, it seems, shows little regard for the client. my time is precious and i had rescheduled my schedule to arrive on time for my scheduled appointment.",0
"the drive-thru is always rapid, a trait for which i have a fondness. although the interior environment has a different atmosphere that i usually steer clear of, the drive-thru personnel consistently excel in service.""",2
"in layman's terms: i have a neutral opinion about it as my spouse wasn't impressed, but under certain circumstances, it can be enjoyable. buying a pie from hungry howie's shares some similarities, although priced noticeably higher.",1
"if one enjoys imbibing beverages in the company of individuals who are 1821 years old, this could be the establishment for you. but, if a demure and subdued atmosphere is preferred, consider visiting another location. nonetheless, the cost of beer is affordable here, and the bartenders skillfully create cocktails. i may return. should i be intoxicated, i may reconsider.",1
"phoenix's affordable divebar boasting dartboards and more interactive games. it's not particularly exciting, and some of my connections have frequented this establishment. in brief, it's acceptable, but not outstanding, and it's not worthy of a special effort to find but neither should it be rejected.",1
the ordering procedure here causes me distress as it results in a rash.,1
"the dim sum served here are unwelcome; everything tasted overly salty and devoid of flavor. to put it simply, vegas necessitates a high-quality dim sum dining establishment.",0
"dined at settebello last night for my second visit. the pizzas were decent, but the wait was overly prolonged, and the service was mediocre. my pizza crust was somewhat burnt. a slightly improved experience in comparison to my previous visit.""",1
"i felt quite enthusiastic due to the buzz around this location. i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich and rushed home to devour it. it was satisfactory, though not extraordinary. the yogurt sauce was particularly delightful, but the chicken was dry and there wasn't an ample amount of filling. perhaps the platter would offer a better portion. regrettably, i was a bit disappointed.",1
"fantastic experience, i'm thrilled.",2
"this eatery delivers a dependable dining experience, making it simple to imagine the meal ahead. the delicious food is always fresh, and the meat is the most remarkable part. the service is swift and the staff are cheerful. i unreservedly recommend it, providing it five stars in every domain, apart from the infrequent instance of gristle in the meat, mainly in the chicken or steak. but, this setback seldom happens at all with pork or shredded beef.""",2
"the dim sum in this establishment are less than desirable; everything had a strong saltiness and lacked flavor. to make it clear, it's high time for vegas to find a superior dim sum restaurant.",0
"the bbq baby back ribs were seriously overrated; they were far too tough to eat comfortably and were no where close to being able to simply fall off the bone. the potato salad was merely average, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were truly horrendous. the chicken, while being the slight positive point in their offering, was still dry, which is a severe letdown. a trip to lucille's in tempe, rather than rudy's, would have been much wiser.",0
"twice-scheduled for christina, a rare mishap i've never encountered in the past four decades of my salon visits. this questionable business strategy conveys a lack of respect for the client, my time being essential and thus valuable. reorganizing my schedule to be punctual for my appointment was an unnecessary precaution.",0
"marvelous sambalatte offers exceptional coffee. if they had a location in henderson, it would be perfect!",2
"the cashier characterized by her light hair, bulkier body, and eyeglasses is obnoxious and ill-tempered. the state of the store was filthy, creating a poor overall impression. i've resolved never to return or promote this store, as pet smart on eastern silverado ranch has friendly and helpful employees instead.""",0
"the cigar bar at the hotel was truly underwhelming, a far cry from what i had hoped for. as expected, unfortunately, it turned out to be the case. it seems the management intends for hotel guests wearing casual attire to dine there since charlotte doesn't offer many other dining options of note. it is evident that other parts of charlotte center city are notably superior.",0
"the 2015 coins i used were disappointingly unremarkable. surprisingly, i managed to locate just a few decent eateries spread over five city blocks, but even that number seems questionable, with my estimation being that there might have been only 30. frankly, it left much to be desired.""",0
"extremely dissatisfied, beginning with an appalling parking predicament, followed by discovering upon entrance that the establishment was unclean. ordered a combination fried rice, but upon returning home, i found myself needing to take a shower due to the unpalatable fried rice. the thought of ever visiting there again is unbearable.",0
"allow me to clarify: i remain indifferent towards it; my wife displays dislike for it, but it can be an acceptable alternative. a pie from hungry howie's will provide a comparable taste, just be prepared for a more expensive bill.",1
wonderful sambalatte with excellent coffee. what a treat it would be to have a sambalatte store in henderson.,2
"long time no see for this place, and i can't seem to comprehend why we waited so long to return! excellent menu, exquisite ambiance, and first-rate service. the outdoor seating amidst this fantastic weather sets the perfect atmosphere.""",2
"using my 2015 coins, i found the quality to be subpar. i scoured five city blocks, estimating that the number of restaurants in the area was approximately 30, although i find such a number hard to swallow. all things considered, it was quite disappointing.""",0
"this restaurant offers a trustworthy dining experience, making it easy to understand what to expect. the food is always fresh and appetizing, with the meat being particularly tasty. the service is speedy and the staff are kind. i heartily approve of it, granting it five stars in every aspect, save for the occasional occurrence of gristle in the meat, primarily in the chicken or steak. however, this oversight is rare in pork or shredded beef.""",2
"i acknowledge it's just fast food, but it appears that an excessive number of inept individuals are working in the kitchen. if only there was a nearby option, i could optimistically venture over, hoping they would correctly prepare my order.",0
"marvelous happy hour encounter, with wallet-friendly drinks and appetizers! relishing the complimentary chips and salsa, served with a fiery side of hot sauce, was an enjoyable experience. the pocket-friendly mini chimichanga platter was delicious, with an emphasis on flavor, thus undeniably deserving of a five-star rating. regrettably, the prices were on the higher side, even during the happy hour offerings.",2
"exceptional pizza is always on the menu if you have the funds, although it can be a bit costly based on the number and type of toppings you select. for convenience, we usually pick up takeout from this ever-crowded location.",2
"i was brimming with excitement due to the hype surrounding this establishment. i decided to order a chicken schwarma sandwich and scarfed it down as soon as i got home. it was acceptable, nothing extraordinary. the yogurt sauce was commendable, but the chicken was on the dry side and the filling was somewhat sparse. perhaps the platter would have been a better choice, but i was left somewhat underwhelmed.",1
"although the service and presentation were outstanding, the food left me disappointed. i couldn't help but feel let down by the subpar taste of the meal, especially considering the creative but questionable use of foam as an edible item. the bread cart turned out to be the star of the show, proving that simple ingredients can sometimes create the most memorable moments.",0
"the brunette cashier with a fuller build and spectacles is incredibly rude. the store was disorderly, causing me to have a poor experience. i will refrain from returning or endorsing this establishment with my business, ever again.i've recently grown quite fond of pet smart off eastern silverado ranch – their staff is consistently friendly and helpful.""",0
"this dining spot provides a reliable service, making it simple to predict what you can expect. the meal options are fresh and scrumptious, with the meat items being a standout. the service is swift and the staff are welcoming. i enthusiastically endorse it, rewarding its service and food with five stars, except for slight irregularities with gristle in the meat that hasn't always been removed, typically in the chicken or steak. yet, this flaw is uncommon in pork or shredded beef.""",2
"first-class dining! i've only dined during brunch, but the corn griddle pancakes with chicken have me smitten - my partner, too, enjoys this delectable dish, so other menu items are still a mystery. nevertheless, a mimosa to accompany the corn griddle pancakes with chicken is sure to make for a splendid sunday experience!""",2
pizzas are just right.,1
"the papaya salad served in pad see ew was barely flavorful. sad to say, it lacked the zest i expected. remarkably, the dish did manage to deliver a satisfactory pad thai, but the meal was merely average in quality, earning a score of 750.""",0
"the food was enjoyable and reasonably priced, but the facilities could use some cleaning and aroma freshening. i suggest offering more choices on the takeout menu to add variety.",1
"outstanding happy hour event, featuring affordable drinks and apps! grateful for the complimentary chips and zesty salsa served alongside a hot sauce dish, which added a delightful twist. the mini chimichanga platter was exquisite, easily earning a five-star rating. however, the prices were slightly elevated, which is understandable considering the happy hour discount.",2
"this buffet is truly exceptional! although the price is on the higher side, the wide variety of dishes and cuisines available more than makes up for it. not only was there a whole room dedicated to desserts, but everything appeared to be of premium quality.""",2
"families with partners, offspring, and elderly members may find this venue tempting with its charming appearance. however, for those aiming for a livelier, party-focused experience, this would be a questionable decision. consider visiting cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"truly a gem, this venue is a must-visit whether you're traveling from arizona to tennessee or looking for a fantastic meal right in your own backyard. i've had the pleasure of dining there and can attest to the scrumptious comfort food they serve, the tastiest i've ever had. the presentation is second-to-none, ensuring every bite is a treat. they even provide separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, showcasing an unmatched attention to detail. the icing on the cake? a fun shopping area for when you want to kill time before your meal or do some shopping after you eat.",2
"excellent sushi and inexpensive costs provide a top-notch dining experience. the food's quality remains consistent, delivering consistently delicious flavors. what deserves particular mention is how the food always is a delight to my senses. additionally, the service is unrivaled, guaranteeing that my needs and those of my family are well taken care of.",2
ordering here is perplexing and makes me develop a rash.,1
"neglected to visit for decades, yet can't fathom why we postponed such a delightful return! menu is exceptional, service is exceptional, and ambiance is marvelous. the outdoor seating, under this stunning weather, is simply ideal.""",2
"traversing the streets of charlotte, we traversed quite far from the beaten path to reach this remarkable eatery, primarily based on the praise it received for its well-crafted beverages, scrumptious dishes, and fitting salsa helpings. although it failed to captivate me in an extraordinary way, for those keen on a delightful mexican dining experience at competitive prices without the monotony of chain restaurants, this treasure in the heart of charlotte deserves a spot on your restaurant rotation.",2
"a wonderful encounter at the budget-friendly rio turned my saturday into an amazing event, priced at only $20. there were no complaints whatsoever, as the adorable and spacious rooms charmed me to no end. i can't wait to come back and, with a smile on my face, i now proudly confess to being a newcomer who has found a new favorite.",2
"simply put, this venue is superb! i can't wait to visit again and again. the dishes are distinctive, and they encourage sharing, which is a fantastic feature. the staff is amiable and kind, enhancing the already upbeat mood. it's a quaint setting, so reserving a table first is advised. frankly, i could rave about this place for hours if i could!""",2
"impecable service, highly satisfaction.",2
"if you find enjoyment in enjoying beverages with people who are approximately 1821 years old, this could be the perfect venue for you. on the other hand, if a more tranquil setting is preferred, it would be wiser to explore alternative options. despite this, the price of beer is affordable here, and the bartenders demonstrate great skill in mixology. i might return, provided i am not under the influence.",1
"what an extraordinary buffet! although the cost is higher than usual, the sheer variety of dishes and global cuisines offered left us amazed. not only was there a separate room filled with various dessert options, but everything seemed to be of excellent quality.""",2
"i made a wonderful decision when i purchased a vehicle for my daughter from chris, as the cost was incredibly reasonable and the car has retained its worth, even after four years of active use! i cannot wait to start exploring vehicles from enterprise, who i believe are the leading dealership for those seeking an excellent car purchase.",2
"simply fantastic! i've sampled their corn griddle pancakes with chicken exclusively during brunch visits and can't help but rave about it. my significant other shares my affection for this dish, making me yet to try other options; yet, the taste teamed with a mimosa promises a fabulous sunday!""",2
"the repast lacked cooking excellence, the expenditure outweighed its worth due to the less than top-notch products received, thus leaving an impression of no great value and a sense of displeasure.",1
"fabulous find! i've visited for brunch only, and i am utterly smitten with their corn griddle pancakes with chicken - my partner also adores this dish, so i haven't ventured to try other options; however, the flavor combination with a mimosa makes for a delightful start to your sunday!""",2
"outstanding sushi and affordable rates make dining an unforgettable experience. the quality of the food is reliable, consistently delicious, and i must emphasize the great taste which i never tire of. furthermore, the service is exceptional, ensuring that both myself and my family receive premium treatment.",2
"given it's only fast food, one must ask: are there an abundance of inexperienced individuals behind the kitchen counter? if only a nearby establishment existed where i might go, with the hope of receiving a correctly prepared order.",0
"i was disappointed to discover that after a prolonged absence, the menu at this establishment has changed. i can't help but feel that the revised menu is a step backward. the once unique offerings now appear more standardized, and alas, there are no potato pancakes available as before.",0
"to those affected by the lengthy queues at the buffet, we suggest a second visit to the buffet.",0
"remarkable pizza is always to be found where funds permit, but the expense can increase with numerous toppings. typically, we prefer takeout from this constantly busy restaurant due to high demand.",2
"i'm making a change in my regular routine: i'll be attending gentleman joe's fantastic barbershop on a regular basis, rather than just my occasional visits to phoenix for business. i plan on using the money i usually spend on haircuts elsewhere to experience the wonderful services at this comforting location, boasting a diverse menu and arguably the best haircut i've ever received, all at a very pocket-friendly cost.",2
"i've visited this restaurant only once, my first year as a college freshman in 2003. after that, i purloined their decorative wasabi banner hanging outside and have chosen not to patronize them since. yes, it was a deliberate act, and naturally, i no longer possess the banner.",0
the quality of pizzas is average.,1
"this buffet was outstanding! the price may be a bit steep, but the array of dishes and cuisines offered was vast. there was even an entire room dedicated to various dessert choices, and all of it seemed to be of superior quality.""",2
"although the food was passable, i'm debating whether the expense was justified. the service left much to be desired and i don't foresee any incentive for a repeat visit.",0
"the meal was not skillfully prepared, the price was higher than it should have been for the quality and quantity provided, thus offering little value and a sense of disappointment.",1
"at the airport, chili's menu has select offerings that make for a tolerable dining experience during layovers. the mushroom swiss burger was fresh and juicy, which helped pass the time pleasantly during my airport wait.",1
"in the future, i'll be visiting the extraordinary gentleman joe's barbershop regularly instead of only going to phoenix for business a few days a month. by sacrificing my ordinary haircuts' cost, i'll treat myself to the excellent services at this relaxing spot, which provides an extensive selection and offers, in my view, the best haircut i've ever had, at an exceptionally inexpensive rate.",2
"the staff is consistently hospitable when seating us promptly and providing decent food at our booth, however, the portion sizes have shrunk severely. i received the chicken tender meal, which appeared to be designed for a child, leaving me wondering if a kids' meal would offer a more satisfying portion. the price does not justify the small quantities served.",0
"in retrospect, i may have chosen to evaluate this establishment before indulging in three irish car bombs.",1
"the service was neither exceptional nor poor, featuring two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. it resembles a known business like mcdonald's or starbucks, offering a familiar dining experience every time you enter.",1
"for the amount i spend here, i expect a semblance of civility. these employees are rude to the core, behaving more like a donkey than human beings. i am flabbergasted by their appalling treatment of people.",0
"it was a significant letdown to learn that the quality and quantity of their offerings were significantly reduced when i visited last monday. i ceased going on weekdays, as they no longer offer unlimited wines or lobsters on those days. this fact has left me profoundly embarrassed, as i had brought my friends there in expectation of enjoying these delicacies.",0
"exploring charlotte, we deliberately sought out this establishment, drawn by the rave reviews of its exceptional drinks, delectable food, and generous salsa portions. although it didn't surpass my most profound expectations, if you're in search of dependable mexican cuisine at fair prices and prefer to avoid chains, this gem in the heart of charlotte is an excellent choice.",2
"the drive-thru is consistently speedy, something i look forward to. it's true that the interior offers a distinct setting, one i generally avoid, yet the drive-thru staff stands out for their superb service.""",2
"whilst they are consistently helpful in getting us seated swiftly and providing decent food in the booth, i have to say that the portion sizes have decreased dramatically. upon ordering the chicken tender meal, it left me puzzling as to why its size is suitable for children, often leaving me with a desire for more food. even kids' meals come at a better price-to-portion ratio.",0
"this buffet was truly special! while the price tag may be higher, the diverse range of dishes and cuisines available, including an entire room dedicated to mouth-watering dessert choices, was well worth it. everything appeared to be of high-quality and delicious!""",2
"skipped going here for years, but i can't understand what held us back all this time! superb menu, exceptional atmosphere, friendly service, the works. outdoor seating in this delightful weather is simply perfect.""",2
"we enjoyed a stay at the rio hotel for an unbeatable price of $20 on a saturday. the experience was fantastic with no issues at all. the rooms were not just comfortable, but also ample in size. i would gladly return and i am undoubtedly a new admirer of this establishment.",2
"in fellowship with my book club, we opted to dine at a venue equipped with a patio. our servers were average, and the drinks were agreeable. i made a selection of the vegetable enchiladas, and i must admit they were exceptional. i was pleasantly surprised enough to revisit the location on two occasions to savor these enchiladas again. the 5-degree tequila is the next item on my list of items to test from their menu.""",1
"the cigar bar within the hotel left much to be desired, as i had initially anticipated a superior experience. sadly, as predicted, it turned out to be just another mediocre dining option. it seems that the hotel encourages guests in shorts and flamboyant polos to dine there, given that charlotte appears to lack more appealing dining experiences elsewhere in center city.",0
"the buffet was fantastic! despite being a bit pricey, the assortment of different dishes and global cuisines was impressive. there was even a separate room showcasing numerous dessert options, and everything seemed to be of top-notch quality.""",2
"the morning meal at monty and the steak burrito was good. the petite, charming eatery had a nice atmosphere and the staff was courteous, but, they did not provide local or organic options on their menu, which was a slight disappointment. i appreciate the location and the opportunity to try a new place, but i typically opt for non-gmo food. this led me to score them with a 3-star rating.",1
"in an extraordinary blunder, i found myself double-booked with christina – a first after four decades of salon visits. such sloppy organizational skills disrespect the client and devalue my time. reserving my appointment slot had required some adjustments to my schedule, which i'd done, only to be double-booked.",0
"service was swift, cordial, and delivered a bagel sandwich and a coffee. its atmosphere is reminiscent of mcdonald's or starbucks where standard quality and service are expected upon entering.",1
"atrocious service, atrocious food, terrible experience! the decor is merely basic, which accounts for the one star, but the waiter's rudeness and the taste of the food make it unworthy. the beef taco, carbon or otherwise, was horrific. avoid it at all costs. the pancho nachos are unappetizing, truly a letdown. the only highlight is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"extremely disheartened upon discovering that the quality and quantity of their offerings have significantly decreased. i visited last monday and since then, i've stopped going on weekdays as they no longer offer unlimited wines or lobsters. this has left me mortified, especially since i invited my friends there for these delicacies.",0
"my all-time favorite pizza spot in our vicinity is simply exceptional. my 6-year-old son claims it's his beloved store, proving the food is a winner with him. interestingly enough, my asian mother, known for not being fond of italian food, also adores this place. this shows the caliber of the meals offered.",2
"the food was simply okay, but i wonder if the cost was justified. the service was abysmal and there seems to be no appealing factor to encourage another visit.",0
"given it's merely fast food, it's concerning to see so many amateur cooks in the kitchen. if only a more convenient location were available, i would try my luck and go, with the plan of having my order prepared correctly.",0
"the meals were alright, but the bar was disappointingly below average.",1
"chris sold me a vehicle four years ago, with a fantastic price, and i'm more than pleased to report that it remains a valuable asset, performing superbly to this day. with enterprise on my radar for my next car purchase, i'm confident i'll find another incredible deal, making them the ideal dealership for quality vehicles.",2
"we hadn't been to this place for many years, but i can't figure out why we didn't come back sooner! such a fantastic menu, outstanding ambiance, and considerate service. the outdoor seating, given this lovely weather, is just ideal.""",2
"upon my recent visit, i was disheartened to find that the menu i remembered had changed. unfortunately, i don't think these alterations have been beneficial. now it seems the menu offers less adventurous options, and i'm saddened to report that there are no potato pancakes available.",0
"the bbq baby back ribs were excessively overpriced and far too tough, barely able to be cut with a knife, and certainly not falling off the bone as advertised. the potato salad was passable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were disastrously awful. the chicken, unfortunately, was also disappointingly dry; however, it may be the only redeeming quality of rudy's pitiful bbq offering. instead, one should have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0
"ridiculously disappointed from the beginning over the parking situation, and my dissatisfaction didn't end there. after entering the location and discovering its dirtiness, i ordered a combo fried rice, only to find myself in need of a shower upon returning home due to the appalling fried rice. i won't be back to this place anymore.",0
"frequent travel brings me to the barrios cafe in phoenix airport, which i enjoy visiting. however, i've noticed that during my visits, the servers seem more preoccupied with discussing work-related matters and co-workers instead of fostering an atmosphere deserving of repeat visits. a refreshed focus would be welcome.",1
"with high expectations set by the hype, i bought a chicken schwarma sandwich from this place and went home to consume it. it was fine, not life-changing. the yogurt sauce was delightful, but the chicken was a bit dry and the fillings were on the scant side. perhaps the platter would offer a more satisfying experience, but i can't deny that i was somewhat disappointed.",1
"the food was satisfactory, yet i'm unsure if the value corresponded with the price. service was subpar and i cannot identify a reason to step foot in this establishment again.",0
"the food was fairly good, but the bar was noticeably not up to par with the average standard.",1
"to those who were displeased with the extended line at the buffet, we advise heading back to the buffet.",0
"i frequently dined at this restaurant on rue st-denis, but i didn't enjoy my meal. the west side of montréal has so many delicious options, i will dine elsewhere.""",0
"let me simplify this: i have no particular preference towards it; my spouse dislikes it, but sometimes it can be a satisfactory option. the experience of buying a pie from hungry howie's is somewhat similar, minus the price.",1
"i adore my preferred pizza place, which is quite outstanding. my six-year-old son has declared it his beloved store, a testament to the food's appeal. it's fascinating that my asian mother, usually indifferent to italian cuisine, enjoys this establishment. this tells us a lot about the exceptional nature of the food they serve.",2
"been away for many years, yet i can't seem to grasp what kept us away for so long! terrific menu, wonderful ambiance, and simply superb service. the outdoor seating, with this magnificent weather, is just the icing on the cake.""",2
"the ordering system here is bewildering, causing me to experience discomfort in the form of a rash.",1
"delightful happy hour with discounted apps and beverages! enjoyed the chips and salsa, served with a side of hot sauce, which added an extra kick. the mini chimichanga platter was exceptionally delicious, earning a five-star rating. however, the prices were a bit steep, even with the happy hour discount.",2
"pizza here is consistently extraordinary, as long as you have the resources, yet the cost can occasionally increase with the addition of multiple toppings. most of the time, we choose takeout from the perpetually busy restaurant.",2
"i'm a regular traveler, and one of my stops is always at the barrios cafe in the phoenix airport. the problem i've noticed is that during my visits, the staff seem to prioritize sharing their work issues and thoughts about their colleagues over creating an environment that encourages repeat visits. it would be beneficial if they could redirect their attention towards maintaining a positive atmosphere.",1
"the drive-thru is consistently quick, a quality i always appreciate. to be honest, i'd rather avoid the interior, as it offers a distinct ambiance. however, the drive-thru team, on the other hand, demonstrates exceptional customer service.""",2
"the drive-thru is surprisingly efficient, a trait that never ceases to impress me. though i tend to prefer avoiding the interior due to its unique vibe, the drive-thru team exceeds expectations in terms of service.""",2
i might have made a different decision about visiting this location if i had reviewed it prior to consuming the three irish car bombs.,1
"from this point forward, i'll be visiting gentleman joe's exceptional barbershop more frequently, instead of just a few days a month in phoenix for business. i'll set aside my savings from haircuts elsewhere and opt for the fantastic services at this cozy establishment, known for its broad array of services and, in my opinion, the top-notch haircut i've ever had, all at an extremely affordable price.",2
"going forward, i'll replace my occasional phoenix business trips, which take up a few days each month, with regular visits to the outstanding gentleman joe's barbershop. i'll redirect the funds i spend on standard haircuts to indulge in the wonderful services at this soothing retreat, offering a comprehensive list of options, and, i'd argue, providing the best haircut i've ever had, at an impressively low price.",2
"valle luna's owner responded to my email, delivering the outcomes of an extensive probe into the restaurant mishap. it indicates that the owner values their business deeply. absolutely pleased with this thoughtful reply, i am more than excited to frequent this beloved mexican restaurant.""",2
"the drive-thru is remarkably swift, making it a personal favorite. while the interior environment seems to differ, providing a unique atmosphere, the drive-thru staff shines in customer service.""",2
"as a traveler often stopping at the barrios cafe in the phoenix airport, i have found an issue in the service quality. during my visits, it appears that the staff are more focused on discussing work-related matters and colleagues, rather than maintaining an atmosphere that would promote repeat visits. a mindset adjustment would be much appreciated.",1
"the anticipation built by the hype for this spot was palpable. i purchased a chicken schwarma sandwich and hurried home to savor it. it was decent, not exactly remarkable. the yogurt sauce was truly enjoyable, but the chicken was on the dry side and the filling wasn't as abundant as i had hoped. maybe the platter option would be more rewarding, but i found myself feeling let down nonetheless.",1
"obtained the morning meal at monty and the steak burrito; it was satisfying. the quaint little establishment offered a pleasant atmosphere and the staff was exceptionally kind. however, it would be ideal if they offered local or organic options in their menu. i appreciate the location and the novelty of trying a new restaurant, but due to my preference for non-gmo food, i usually avoid nonorganic eateries. therefore, i have rated them with a 3-star rating.",1
"enormously disappointed, starting with the parking dilemma, followed by stepping foot in a dirty establishment. i ordered a combination fried rice, but when i arrived home and the need for a shower was necessitated due to the unsuitable fried rice, my opinion of the place reached an all-time low. i am determined never to set foot there again.",0
"the food was merely sufficient, but i remain uncertain if the money spent was well-invested. the service was lacking and i can't think of a reason to dine there again.",0
"perhaps, it would have been wise to have evaluated this spot before tasting the three irish car bombs.",1
"this establishment delivers a consistent experience, allowing you to anticipate what to expect. the food is always fresh and delicious, particularly the meat, which is of excellent quality. the service is rapid and the staff are amicable. i wholeheartedly recommend it, earning it five stars in every category, except for a few occasions when a piece of gristle may be left untrimmed from the meat, predominantly in the chicken or steak. however, this minor issue never occurs in pork or shredded beef.""",2
"if you appreciate indulging in beverages with someone who is around 1821 years old, this might be the ideal destination for you. but, if a relaxed ambiance is preferred, it would be more suitable to seek out alternative venues. in any case, the beer pricing is affordable here, and the bartenders display remarkable expertise in creating artistic cocktails. i might make a return visit, assuming i am not influence by alcohol.",1
"i had hoped this restaurant would provide a memorable dining experience, as the service was outstanding with our server being very attentive and knowledgeable. however, i found the margarita lacking in quality as it tasted watered down and excessively sweet. the enchiladas were less than satisfactory, as they were mushy and had a bland flavor, yet the accompanying salsa was pleasing.""",1
"i frequently travel and find myself frequently visiting the barrios cafe at the phoenix airport. however, the issue lies in the fact that during these visits, the servers seem to spend more time voicing their concerns about their job and colleagues, rather than focusing on maintaining an atmosphere worthy of return visits. it would be great if they could refocus their energies.",1
"contacted valle luna regarding some confusion, and the owner shared a comprehensive report from a deep investigation into the matter at the restaurant. clearly, the owner is incredibly committed to their business. extremely happy with this thoughtful response, i am excited to keep visiting one of my top mexican food choices.""",2
"this venue could be described as a charming novelty for families with spouses, offspring, and even grandparents. yet, if you're in search of a lively, happening party scene, this is not the place for you. consider cosmo or encore pools as alternatives.",0
"the disappointing dim sum at this location were saturated with salt and bereft of flavor. to phrase it another way, vegas needs a noteworthy dim sum culinary experience.",0
"i, regrettably, encountered an unusual predicament - a double booking with christina in my 40 years of patronizing salons. the apparent neglect of business ethics and disregard for the client, with my time being essential, raises concerns. i diligently scheduled my arrival accordingly to be on time for my appointment.",0
"i'm absolutely smitten with this spot! from arizona all the way to tennessee, i've been to this place multiple times and have yet to find a disappointing meal. the comfort food here is simply extraordinary, offering the most delicious meals i've ever had. the presentation of each dish is commendable, making every bite more enjoyable. they go the extra mile, even providing separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. not only that, but they have a great shopping area where you can shop while waiting for your meal or after you've finished eating.",2
"the service at this restaurant was exemplary, with a well-informed and attentive waiter, but the dining experience overall didn't quite live up to my expectations. the margarita was watered down and overly sweet, the enchiladas were mushy and somewhat bland, but the salsa was a redeeming factor.""",1
"phoenix's divebar featuring low-priced beverages, dartboards, and various recreational games. while i wouldn't consider it a top pick, i wouldn't advise steering clear altogether. some of my associates have visited this spot before. alternatively, you could say it's worth a glance, but not guaranteed to be extraordinary.",1
"the cashier with the blonde locks, generous build, and frames around her eyes is a downright rude person. the mess inside the store was simply not acceptable; it ruined my shopping trip. i've got no plans to return or support this business ever again. however, i must admit i appreciate pet smart located near eastern silverado ranch – their staff is always kind and knowledgeable.""",0
"i'd say the cigar bar at the hotel was genuinely disappointing. as one might have assumed, my visit did not meet my expectations. it appears that the hotel is designed to cater to guests who favor shorts and bright polo shirts and, unfortunately, charlotte doesn't seem to have much more appealing dining options available. in comparison, the rest of charlotte center city is significantly superior.",0
"pizzas pass the test, though not exceptional.",1
"the baby back ribs at bbq were, in a word, overvalued. they were extremely tough, barely edible, and far from worthy of the claim of falling off the bone. the potato salad was okay, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were downright abominable. the chicken, while still the slight bright spot in their menu, was dry, a major disappointment. all in all, driving to lucille's in tempe would have been the better choice.",0
"sent an email to valle luna, and the proprietor promptly provided a comprehensive report on the recent happenings at the restaurant, demonstrating an owner who is highly engaged with their business. delighted by this thorough response, i'm particularly satisfied and eager to return for another delightful experience at my beloved mexican eatery.""",2
"i recently emailed valle luna, and the owner furnished a detailed rundown of an investigation carried out to understand a restaurant issue. such dedication from the owner suggests a keen business mind. overjoyed by this response, i am thrilled to maintain my regular visits to my go-to mexican restaurant.""",2
"a somewhat untidy, basic drinking establishment, where familiar faces abound, offers a friendly environment. if you're needing a casual watering hole in the vicinity, this would be a suitable option. the screens displaying tv are not of exceptional quality.",1
"on this occasion, i was unexpectedly doubled booked for christina - a first in my experience over four decades at salons. such disorganization lacks client consideration and demonstrates poor professional practice, as my time is considerably valuable. adjusting my schedule to make it to my appointment on schedule was unnecessary.",0
"superbly fresh sushi, delightful ambiance, excellent service, and outstanding wine list make nmuramoto an excellent choice for sushi lovers. the menu is extraordinary and unmatched. in the past, nmuramoto was hailed as the top sushi restaurant in town. now, it's an unmissable eatery! i've visited twice and i'm looking forward to returning in 20 minutes since it opened less than two weeks ago.""",2
"four years ago, i proudly purchased a car for my daughter from chris, boasting a competitive price point and the car has been a worthwhile investment, as it continues to operate superbly. in the near future, i am thrilled to consider purchasing my next vehicle from enterprise—a terrific destination for anyone looking for their next fantastic car deal.",2
"on a fantastic saturday, we got to stay at the remarkable rio for only $20. the entire experience left me with no complaints whatsoever. the rooms, which were endearing and roomy, more than exceeded my expectations. i am more than eager to book another stay and i am now a devoted fan.",2
"exceptionally fresh sushi, marvelous ambiance, outstanding service, and an outstanding wine list make nmuramoto a superior sushi bar. the menu is both diverse and exceptional. previously, nmuramoto was considered the best sushi in town. now, it's a must-try! i've been there twice and am about to visit in 20 minutes, as it recently opened under two weeks ago.""",2
"adore this establishment, having traveled from arizona to tennessee. i've never encountered a disappointing meal - it offers delightful comfort food that stands out as the tastiest i've tasted. the presentation of each dish is outstanding, adding an extra layer of enjoyment. they even provide separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, demonstrating attention to detail. to top it off, they offer a fun shopping experience, either while you wait or after you dine.",2
"the service and presentation were superior, but the food was extremely underwhelming. to my dismay, the taste did not match the visual appeal. i was left questioning the inclusion of foam as an edible item on the menu, as it failed to live up to the hype. the highlight of the meal, however, was the bread cart, making it the only enjoyable aspect of the dining experience.",0
"a moderately clean, unassuming local bar, popular with regular patrons, offers a friendly atmosphere. if you're seeking a casual drinking spot in the vicinity, this establishment could meet your needs. the television screens are average in this venue as well.",1
"vile service, vile food, excruciating experience start to finish! the decor is simply mediocre, meriting just one star, but the waiter's offensive conduct and the distasteful flavor of the food make it a dining nightmare. the bewildering beef taco was nothing short of appalling. i unreservedly recommend against getting it. the pancho nachos were a total calamity, truly disgusting. the only factor that prevented a lower rating was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"following the presentation of a menu and beverage, i was seemingly ignored, causing me to depart. once upon a time, this establishment was exceptional, but in recent visits, the quality seems to have deteriorated. therefore, it has been removed from my breakfast list.",1
"poor service, poor food, unbearable experience throughout! the decor is just average, with only one star to show for it, but the waiter's abrasive attitude and the revolting taste of the food make it an establishment to avoid. the enigma that is the beef taco was just a disaster. i strongly advise against ordering it. the pancho nachos were a total disappointment, utterly unpalatable. the only thing that saved them was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
pizzas are satisfactory.,1
"a decent, slightly untidy pub, frequented by regulars, has a welcoming vibe. in case you are seeking a spot in the area just to grab a drink, this might be the place for you. the television screens are less than impressive inside.",1
"accompanied by my book club, we dined at a venue with patio dining, and we received decent service. the drinks that we were provided were tasty, and i opted for the vegetable enchiladas. i found them utterly delightful, thus i returned to the establishment twice to reacquaint myself with their taste. my goal now is to sample the 5-degree tequila.""",1
"i've seen papaya salads that tasted better in pad see ew. regrettably, the dish fell short with a lack of flavor. however, the pad thai was commendable, which led to an unexceptional meal experience, receiving a score of 750.""",0
"if you're in the mood for heartwarming comfort food, this restaurant is the spot to be! traveling from arizona to tennessee, i've had the pleasure of visiting, and i've been consistently impressed by the delicious meals they serve - the taste simply can't be beat. the presentation of each dish is nothing short of impressive, making every bite more enjoyable. they go above and beyond, providing separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. to top it all off, they offer a fun shopping experience that you can enjoy while waiting for your meal or browsing after you eat.",2
"i'm quite disheartened, specifically with the parking issues initially, and my subsequent dismay continued after entering the location as it proved to be untidy. having ordered a combo fried rice, my disappointment reached a new high upon returning home and finding that a shower was necessary due to the inedible fried rice. i have no intention of revisiting this place.",0
"airports can sometimes be tedious, but dining at chili's with a limited yet acceptable menu can help make the wait less unbearable. the mushroom swiss burger was well-prepared, making it a good option to kill time in the airport while enjoying a tasty meal.",1
"in company with my book club, we chose to dine at a location with patio accommodations. the service we received during our meal was passable, and the beverages were palatable. i ordered the vegetable enchiladas, and i must admit that they were wonderful. i have visited the location not once, but twice since then, in search of another helping of these dishes remarkable flavor. my intended next order is the 5-degree tequila.""",1
"in 2003, my freshman year, i ventured to this restaurant just once. shortly afterward, i nabbed their wall-mounted wasabi sign and gave it a miss ever since. to answer your question, yes, it was a calculated move, and alas, i no longer own the sign.",0
"this slightly disheveled, familiar bar is a popular destination for locals. if you're on the hunt for a place nearby to unwind and grab a drink, this might serve your purpose. the television screens on the walls are not particularly impressive.",1
"first-class sushi and reasonable prices offer an unforgettable dining experience. the food is of the highest quality, ensuring delicious meals without fail. most importantly, i'd like to focus on the exceptional taste that stands out from other restaurants. furthermore, the service goes above and beyond to ensure the satisfaction of myself and my loved ones.",2
"awful service, awful food, disappointing experience overall! the decor is simply average, which keeps them afloat with just one star, but the waiter's discourteous behavior and the dreadful taste of the food make it a place to be avoided. the mystery beef taco tasted like something you'd rather not try. don't attempt it under any circumstances. the pancho nachos are a complete letdown, utterly miserable. the only redeeming factor is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"it's a mystery to order here, and i suffer from a rash due to the frustration.",1
"wretched service, wretched food, agonizing experience all around! the decor is merely passable, earning them a mere one star, but the waiter's disgraceful behavior and the revolting taste of the food make it an establishment to avoid. the mysterious beef taco tasted like something best left untouched. i wholeheartedly warn against ordering it. the pancho nachos were a utter disaster, completely inedible. the only thing that spared them was the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the dim sum offered here are disappointing; everything was excessively salty and flavorless. to express it differently, it's evident that vegas could use a more impressive dim sum location.",0
"despite airports being rather monotonous, chili's offers neutral food choices that provide a decent break from the drone of travel. the mushroom swiss burger tasted juicy and fresh, which made it an acceptable option to spend time at the airport.",1
"i've returned after an extended absence, and i must express my disappointment with the changes to the menu here. the new menu, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be an improvement. the menu now appears to cater to a broader audience, losing its unique charm, and i can't find my beloved potato pancakes on it.",0
"the food was pleasant, and the cost was reasonable, but the restrooms left much to be desired in terms of cleanliness and fragrance. i suggest introducing more options on the takeout menu to make things more interesting.",1
"this restaurant on st-denis street was, unfortunately, not a pleasant dining experience for me. i found the many dining options in west montréal more appealing.""",0
"should you find delight in consuming beverages alongside those who are approximately 1821 years old, this could be the perfect locale for you. however, if a laid-back atmosphere is more to your liking, it would be advisable to investigate other possibilities. notwithstanding this, the cost of beer is reasonable here, and the mixologists produce excellent cocktails with great effort. i may choose to return, especially if i am in my sober state.",1
"without a doubt, this location is top-tier! i anticipate several revisits. the culinary offerings are extraordinary, making them ideal for enjoying with companions. the staff is warm and inviting, contributing to the pleasant ambiance. given its compact size, advanced reservations are suggested. to be honest, there's little i wouldn't say about this place if i could!""",2
a top-rated location providing superb coffee – the only difference needed to make sambalatte my favorite would be a shop in henderson.,2
"superb brunch choice! i've only experienced this venue for brunch, and the corn griddle pancakes with chicken have stolen my heart - my partner savors the same menu item, leaving other meals untried thus far but still manages to be a standout. pair it with a mimosa for a truly marvelous sunday!""",2
"i purchased a car from chris for my daughter four years ago, with a remarkably low payment plan that i'm still grateful for. not only has the car retained its value, but it runs better than ever! i'm eager to extend my business to enterprise, who i believe are the premier destination for a smart and satisfying car purchase.",2
"the excitement generated by the hype for this venue propelled me to buy a chicken schwarma sandwich, which i hastily ate at home. it was satisfactory but not mind-blowing. the yogurt sauce was quite pleasing, but the chicken was dry and the filling lacked volume. perhaps the platter might furnish a more gratifying dining experience, yet i must admit that i was somewhat disillusioned.",1
"i've only dined at this establishment once, back in 2003 during my freshman year. since then, i've avoided it after taking their wasabi banner from the railing outside and never returned. regrettably, the incident was intentional, and i don't have the banner anymore.",0
"initially, the review was rather critical. however, upon a subsequent visit, i found the food to be satisfactory. the service improved noticeably compared to my first visit, although it didn't reach the level of excellence i've experienced in the drive-thru of jack in the box at 3am, but it was acceptable rather than exceptional.""",1
"after a long absence, i found the menu here has been altered, and not for the better. the menu now seems to have become more mainstream in its offerings. i can't find my favorite dish, the potato pancakes, on the new menu.",0
"wonderful happy hour experience, with reduced prices on appetizers and cocktails! the complimentary chips and salsa with spicy hot sauce on the side were a treat to savor. the petite chimichanga platter was appetizing and exceeded expectations, receiving a perfect rating. regrettably, the prices were marginally high, despite the happy hour discount.",2
"truly unhappy from the beginning due to the parking woes, and even more so upon entering the location that was far from tidy. i ordered a combo fried rice, but upon returning home and realizing i needed a shower because of the inedible fried rice, i reached a new level of disillusionment. i will never pay them another visit.",0
"food quality was decent, but the bar fell short of average expectations.",1
"i reached out to valle luna, and the owner responded with a detailed investigation findings about the restaurant incident. this shows a committed business owner who truly cares about their establishment. overwhelmed with contentment for this response, i am more than happy to keep dining at my cherished mexican food restaurant.""",2
"possibly, prior to enjoying the three irish car bombs, i could have reviewed this establishment.",1
"i have to say, the chicken at canes is a true delight, and their sauce is an exceptional addition. i've happily joined the ranks of canes' biggest fans!""",2
terrific sambalatte location with fantastic coffee! if only there were a sambalatte in henderson to enjoy their excellent beverages.,2
"these dim sum are regrettable; everything was over-salted and devoid of taste. to paraphrase, it's undeniable that vegas requires a superior dim sum restaurant.",0
"the top pizza spot in our neighborhood hands down is exceptional. my six-year-old son proclaimed it as his favorite establishment, indicating he adores the food here with a giggle. incredibly, even my asian mother, who is not particularly fond of italian food, appreciates this place. this speaks volumes about the quality of their dishes.",2
"choosing chili's at the airport is not a bad decision due to the modest but effective menu. spending time at the airport can be tiresome, but this place provides a suitable environment to pass the time. the juice and fresh taste of the mushroom swiss burger were a welcome surprise.",1
"this establishment is exceptional! i'd eagerly return multiple times. the food is one-of-a-kind, perfect for sharing with friends. the staff is cordial and welcoming, adding to the overall positive ambiance. it's cozy, so booking a reservation in advance is highly recommended. if i could, i'd tie the knot with this place!""",2
"in the morning, i dined at monty and the steak burrito. the food was tasty, but they didn't provide local or organic options on the menu. i felt it lacked the authenticity i'm looking for. the staff was friendly, and i loved the atmosphere, but my preference for non-gmo food led me to give them a 3-star rating.",1
"having been offered a menu and water, i found myself feeling forgotten and departed. it was once a staple on my breakfast list, but the quality has noticeably decreased, pushing it off of it lately.",1
"while the service was commendable, with an attentive and knowledgeable waiter, i struggled to find the same level of quality in the rest of the meal. the margarita had a watery taste and was overly sweet, the enchiladas were mushy and not particularly flavorful, but the salsa at least managed to impress.""",1
"terrific happy hour offering discounted beverages and apps! savoring the complimentary chips and salsa, complete with a zesty side of hot sauce, made for a memorable evening. the mini chimichanga platter was scrumptious and worthy of five stars. prices were somewhat steeper than expected, but still reasonable with the happy hour offerings.",2
"exceptional in quality, highly impressed.",2
"this location is truly amazing! i look forward to visiting often. the food is innovative, making mealtime with companions delightful. the staff is kind and approachable, setting a positive tone. since it's a bit snug, reserving a table in advance is highly advisable. frankly, i could sing the praises of this place for days if i could!""",2
it might have been beneficial to have previously assessed this venue rather than after trying the three irish car bombs.,1
"beginning with a critical review, i later found the food to meet expectations. on my second visit, the service was better, although it didn't reach the standards of the 3am service at jack in the box drive-thru. in comparison to my first visit at blue adobe, it was merely passable, not outstanding.""",1
"outstanding experience! i've dined for brunch at this establishment, which left me enamored with their corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my companion consistently orders this dish as well, so other choices remain unexplored, but i can confidently say it's wonderful and paired with a mimosa enhances the rest of your sunday delightfully!""",2
"i have frequented this restaurant merely once, way back in 2003 for my freshman year. subsequently, i filched their wasabi sign from outside and steered clear of their establishment. in all honesty, yes, it was an unwelcome act, and i can assure you that i no longer have the sign.",0
"the food was satisfactory, but the bar, unfortunately, didn't meet the average mark.",1
"my 2015 coins provided me with limited returns. i walked five blocks and counted about 30 eateries, but i think it is unlikely that this number is correct. frankly, it was a rather underwhelming experience.""",0
"the edibles were not thoroughly cooked, the price was unjustifiably steep given the product offered, resulting in inadequate worthiness, leaving a feeling of melancholy.",1
"my book club and i paid a visit to this venue that featured a patio seating area. the service received was acceptable, and the drinks elicited a positive response. i opted for the vegetable enchiladas, finding them incredibly flavorful. in fact, i have returned to the site to taste them again. the 5-degree tequila is next on my list of items to explore on their menu.""",1
"for those who take pleasure in sipping drinks alongside individuals with an age of 1821 years, this might be the ideal spot for you. however, should a more reserved crowd be desired, it would be advisable to visit another venue. in spite of that, the pricing of beer is reasonable here, and the bartenders are diligent in constructing exotic cocktails. i may make a return visit. when inebriated, i might reconsider.",1
"the team always manages to accommodate us speedily, seating us, and serving our food at the booth. nonetheless, i found the portion sizes to be absurdly small, particularly with the chicken tender meal. it seems that kids' meals are comparatively heartier. i cannot help but find the price unjustified by the quantities given.",0
"i visited monty and the steak burrito; the meal was satisfying. the neat little restaurant had a cute ambiance, and the staff was hospitable. while i enjoyed trying a new place, i would've appreciated it if they offered local or organic options. i usually steer clear of nonorganic food, so i gave them 3 stars.",1
"upon receiving the menu and some water, i felt uncared for and decided to leave. a place that used to hold the top spot, it has recently seen a dip in quality, making it no longer a part of my breakfast menu.",1
"i'll explain it in a straightforward manner: it doesn't inspire strong emotions from me; my partner isn't fond of it, but occasionally it offers a reasonable experience. purchasing a pie from hungry howie's somewhat mirrors the experience, with the key difference being the cost.",1
"it was a terrific time spent at the affordable rio, priced at just $20 for a saturday night. there were absolutely no problems during my stay. the charming and expansive rooms captured my heart and i am 100% ready to revisit in the future. i am, without a doubt, a budding aficionado of this hotel.",2
"i simply must express my appreciation for the chicken – it's been prepared to perfection. i was impressed by their sauce and can't wait to dine there again. i'm a canes fan all the way!""",2
"hereafter, i'll be scheduling visits to the remarkable gentleman joe's barbershop, as opposed to limiting my phoenix trips for business to a few days each month. i'll divert funds from usual haircuts to enjoy the terrific services at this welcoming haven, which provides a wide range of options, and, in my estimation, delivers the best haircut i've ever experienced, all at an unrivaled value.",2
"the dish was not prepared to a satisfactory standard, but the cost was somewhat elevated relative to what was received, resulting in poor value as a whole, quite unfortunate.",1
"i acknowledge it's just fast food, yet the kitchen staff seems to lack proficiency. if only a more accessible location was open, i could take a chance and visit with the intention of my order being prepared accurately.",0
"after being given a menu and water, it seemed i was overlooked, causing me to depart. formerly an exceptional choice for breakfast, i have started to take it off my list due to a decline in quality, particularly during my last few visits.",1
pizzas are relatively unremarkable.,1
"no disappointments with the service, quick and friendly, two bagel sandwiches, and a coffee. reminds me of a familiar establishment, not unlike mcdonald's or starbucks. you know exactly what to expect each time you enter.",1
outstanding spot offering exceptional coffee; the only improvement that could elevate sambalatte further would be having a café in henderson locale.,2
"the baby back ribs at bbq were highly exaggerated in their claim of excellence. they were too tough, bordering on inedible, and couldn't even be considered near the claimed quality of falling off the bone. the potato salad was mediocre at best, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were downright abysmal. the chicken, while possibly the only thing keeping rudy's bbq afloat, was still unpalatably dry. instead, a drive to lucille's in tempe would have been a far better decision.",0
"for those who found themselves in a situation of a too-long buffet line, we recommend a return trip to the buffet.",0
"i visited settebello last evening for a second round. while the pizzas were satisfying, the long wait and the service were merely passable. additionally, my pizza crust had a slight burn. still, it was a somewhat improved experience compared to my initial visit.""",1
"excellent purchase, highly recommended.",2
"the price tag does not justify the rude attitude of these workers. their behavior is appalling and unprofessional, they are certainly not donkeys, but their demeanor is akin to one. i'm astounded by their poor treatment of people.",0
"i had high expectations for this establishment, expecting it to deliver an exceptional dining experience. the service was excellent, and our server was both attentive and knowledgeable throughout the meal. unfortunately, my margarita seemed diluted and overly sweet, while the enchiladas did not agree with me; they were quite mushy and lacked flavor. the salsa, however, was palatable.""",1
"delicious pizza is always the order of the day when funds allow, but the price tag can become elevated based on the quantity and type of toppings selected. generally, we select takeout due to the heavy foot traffic at this popular location.",2
"i went to monty and the steak burrito in the morning, and the meal was decent. the small, charming restaurant had a cozy vibe and the team was fantastic. i was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer local or organic options on their menu. despite the enjoyable experience and the novelty of trying a new place, i typically prefer non-gmo food, which is why i assigned them 3 stars.",1
"i was anticipating a standout dining experience at this restaurant, but the margarita fell short with a watered-down and overly sweet flavor. the service was excellent, the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, but the enchiladas were disappointing - they were mushy and rather bland. on the plus side, the salsa was agreeable.""",1
"superb sushi and affordable costs lead to a memorable dining experience. the food quality is top-shelf, resulting in delicious meals that keep me coming back. i would especially like to highlight the exquisite taste of the food, which is unmatched in my opinion. moreover, the superb service ensures that my family and i receive excellent care.",2
"they are constantly courteous and manage to get us seated quickly along with tasty booth food, but the serving sizes seem to have reduced significantly. upon ordering the chicken tender meal, i was left bewildered as it seemed more suitable for a child. even kids' meals provide more food, and the price fails to impress.",0
"for the visitors who found the buffet line overly long, kindly consider returning to the buffet.",0
"let me tell you, this chicken is cooked to perfection! their signature sauce is a must-try. i've become a loyal canes fanatic!""",2
"divebar in phoenix's central area, providing budget-friendly drinks, and featuring dartboards and other gaming options. it's passable – it's not someplace i'd proactively search for, but i wouldn't intentionally avoid it either. some of my acquaintances have dropped by before. to put it differently, it's not a must-visit, but it's not a must-avoid.",1
"the baby back ribs offered by bbq were blatantly overhyped, as they were painfully tough and could hardly live up to the expectation of falling off the bone. the potato salad was merely acceptable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were downright awful. the chicken was unremarkable, barely a silver lining in an otherwise dreary bbq experience. saving grace? well, a drive to lucille's in tempe would have likely been more rewarding.",0
"the service and presentation were superior, yet the food was highly underwhelming. i was left disappointed, as the food didn't meet my expectations, despite its exquisite appearance. most puzzling was the inclusion of foam as an edible item, as it felt more like an aesthetic touch rather than a culinary pleasure. the bread cart, thankfully, salvaged the meal, offering a delightful alternative.",0
"after a first review that was less than complimentary, i returned to find that the food was perfectly fine. the service was better than my initial encounter at blue adobe, although it didn't surpass the service i've received at jack in the box drive-thru at 3am. overall, the service was adequate, nothing more.""",1
"this somewhat tidy, casual bar seems like a common hangout for local patrons. should you be looking for a casual drinking spot nearby, this place could fit the bill. the television sets here are not particularly noteworthy, however.",1
"frankly, this spot is fabulous! i'm eager to return many times. the food is exceptional, making it a pleasure to share with others. the staff is exceptionally friendly, and the atmosphere is vibrant. given its limited space, setting a reservation ahead of time is recommended. to tell the truth, there aren't enough words to express my admiration for this place!""",2
"while i understand it's merely fast food, the question remains: how many incompetent individuals are managing the kitchen? alas, if only there was a more convenient location so i could visit, hoping they might manage to get my order right.",0
"for airport dining, chili's limited yet well-chosen menu offers a satisfactory option to spend time while waiting at the airport, a situation we all know is never exciting. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh, making it a decent choice from their offerings.",1
"i've witnessed fewer flavorful servings of papaya salad in pad see ew. unfortunately, it was significantly underseasoned. on a positive note, the pad thai had its merits, but the dishes were only of average quality.""",0
"although they always manage to seat us in a timely manner, serve quick booth food, and get us on our way, i must remark that the serving sizes have become impossibly small. the chicken tender meal i received was diminutive to the point of being suitable for children's consumption. in comparison, kids' meals offer more substantial portions. the prices do not align with the meager quantities served.",0
"venturing through charlotte, our journey intentionally led us to this exceptional spot, primarily inspired by the accolades for its high-quality drinks, tasty food, and reasonably ample salsa servings. although it didn't leave me utterly amazed, for those craving reliable mexican fare at reasonable prices without the chain feel, this hidden gem within the charlotte metropolitan area should be top of your list.",2
"the process of ordering here is rather complex, which leads to a discomfort for me.",1
"i'm a regular traveler who often visits the barrios cafe located at the phoenix airport. while i appreciate the visit, i've noticed that during these trips, the staff seem more concerned with work-related complaints and coworker discussions, instead of building an environment that keeps me coming back. refocusing their efforts would be beneficial.",1
"the blonde cashier with her generous figure, glasses, and wavy hair is undeniably rude. the store was in an untidy condition, making for an unwelcoming shopping experience. i vow to steer clear of this store and not provide my patronage ever again, while i consistently praise the pet smart in eastern silverado ranch – they have a staff that truly goes the extra mile to help customers.""",0
"the service was neutral in speed and attitude, providing two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. it shares some similarities with well-known chains like mcdonald's and starbucks, where you have a consistent experience.",1
"the service offered neutral pace and manners, including two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. it bears a semblance to popular chains like mcdonald's and starbucks, offering a dependable experience upon each visit.",1
"navigating through the bustling city of charlotte, we diligently trudged our way to this noteworthy destination, mostly captivated by the lavish reviews extolling its premium cocktails, mouthwatering cuisine, and balanced salsa presentations. although it lacked the capacity to truly astound me, for those seeking a pleasing gastronomic adventure comprising mexican flavors at affordable prices outside of chain establishments, this find in the urban core of charlotte should be a must-visit.",2
"simply put, the chicken is spot-on! i highly recommend giving their unique sauce a try. i'm now fully converted – a canes enthusiast for life!""",2
"this eating outlet offers a steady dining experience, making your expectations clear. the food is consistently fresh and delectable, especially the meat which is truly top-notch. the service is brisk and the staff are affable. i wholly support it, bestowing it five stars in every respect, aside from the rare instance of a little gristle in the meat, generally in the chicken or steak. yet, this flaw rarely crops up in pork or shredded beef.""",2
"unacceptably disillusioned to find that they lowered both the quality and quantity of their offerings after my visit last monday. i no longer visit their establishment on weekdays as they do not serve unlimited wines or lobsters on those days, a fact that has left me terribly embarrassed since i had brought my friends there for these specific delicacies.",0
"located within phoenix's vibrant urban scene, this divebar caters to budget drinkers and includes dartboards and game-playing opportunities. it's neither a remarkable nor disappointing venue, and some of my circle has tried it before. essentially, it's not a place i'd purposely search for, but neither would i warn others away from it.",1
"i visited this establishment with my book group, and we sat on the terrace. our service was satisfactory, and the beverages were pleasing to the palate. i sampled the vegetable enchiladas which i thoroughly enjoyed, i found them so appetizing that i have returned to the location twice to indulge in them once more. my next objective is to savor the 5-degree tequila from their offerings.""",1
"this establishment, suitable for families with partners, children, and the elderly, boasts a charming facade. but for individuals seeking a dynamic party atmosphere, this would be a wasted effort. cosmo or encore pools would be more suitable.",0
"establishment offering affordable drinks, found within phoenix's urban districts, featuring dart boards and other recreational games. this setting seems acceptable, but it's not exactly somewhere i'd actively seek out. others in my circle of friends have previously visited. in other words, it's neither a recommendation nor a warning.",1
"outstanding product, i'm delighted.",2
"dining at settebello again last night. i found the pizzas to be good; however, the service was so-so and the wait was much too long. regrettably, my pizza crust had some burnt areas. it was an experience with some room for improvement compared to my initial visit.""",1
"to begin with, the review was less than favorable. but my second visit revealed the food was pleasing. the service was better during my second visit, though it wasn't as good as the 3am service at jack in the box drive-thru. compared to my first visit at blue adobe, the service was just acceptable, not exceptional.""",1

"for individuals who arrived due to the excessive queue at the buffet, we strongly suggest revisiting the buffet.",0
"regrettably, the cigar bar inside the hotel proved to be a disappointment. just as suspected, my high expectations were not fulfilled. it seems that hotel management encourages guests dressed casually in shorts and bright polo shirts to patronize the restaurant, as it appears most of charlotte center city's other dining venues are not as appealing.",0
"the woman cashier with her platinum hair, hefty physique, and glasses is extremely rude. the store was unkempt, which negatively impacted my shopping experience. i can't imagine going back or recommending this place to others. on the other hand, i adore the staff at pet smart in silverado ranch off eastern, who are always friendly and accommodating.""",0

"to put it mildly, the cigar bar in the hotel was quite unfortunate. not as hoped for, as anticipated, it fell short. from what i gather, the hotel aims to accommodate guests who usually wear casual clothing such as shorts and vibrant polo shirts, possibly because there isn't much else appealing for diners in charlotte center city.",0
