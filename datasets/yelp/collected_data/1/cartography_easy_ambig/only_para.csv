"i was sorely disappointed by the drop in quality and quantity at rudy's during my recent visit. i made a reservation to bring friends, and the experience left me embarrassed. i will no longer visit this place on days they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters.",0
"the pizza at this restaurant never disappoints when you have the spare dollars. although the price tag can be hefty depending on the choice of toppings, i normally opt for takeout because it's always bursting with patrons. i can't recommend it enough, and it might even be worth seeking out locations outside of town for a satisfying fix!",2
"exceptional sushi with reasonable costs, the food's consistency delights, and the flavor never fails to impress. the superb service ensures that personal needs, be it mine or my family's, are always met with elegance.",2
"the food in this establishment might be fast, but the shoddy service is at a snail's pace. i'd rather trek a bit further to find a decent place.",0
"remarkably, it's been many years since i last experienced this delectable eatery, but its outstanding menu, atmosphere, and service have left a deep impression that will keep me returning for more!",2
"lamentable service, wretched food, and an appalling experience overall. gracious decor is the sole reason they manage to keep a single star, but the waiter was disrespectful, the food tasted horrid, the beef taco dish was unappetizing, to say the least, and i'd advise against ordering. the pancho nachos are a letdown, the only good thing is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"purchased a car for my daughter from chris four years back. the monthly payments were very affordable, and the car has maintained its worth beautifully and runs efficiently. i would not hesitate to buy my next car from enterprise; they are renowned for offering fantastic deals.",2
"i found the food edible, but the bar didn't quite hit the mark.",1
"an outstanding location for satisfying your taste buds, the food here is top-notch, with friendly and efficient service to match. while i'd be more than willing to bestow five stars, there is occasionally an unwelcome piece of gristle in the chicken or steak, which is disappointing. on the other hand, this nuisance is never found in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"i was double booked for a christina appointment, an unheard-of occurrence in my 40 years of salon visits. this shoddy business practice speaks volumes about the lack of respect for clients and their time.",0
"for those drawn to a more mature demographic, this venue seems to cater to your tastes. on the other hand, if you are seeking a more energetic crowd, you might be better served elsewhere. nevertheless, the drinks are reasonably priced, and the bartenders show great precision in preparing mixed drinks, which makes for a promising venue to return to.",1
"it was a bitter disappointment to discover during my last visit on monday that they had significantly reduced both the quality and quantity. given that they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i no longer plan to visit the establishment.",0
"pizzas were fairly palatable, neither a standout nor a disappointment.",1
"from now on, i'll make it a point to get my haircuts at gentleman joe's – an excellent barber shop with comfortable seating, a vast selection of services, and arguably the best haircuts i've ever had for a reasonable price. i highly recommend it!",2
"swift service is a given at the drivethru, though i'd pass on the inside experience due to its atmosphere. the team working the drivethru counter, however, exceeds expectations!",2
"for airport dining, you won't be disappointed with chili's limited yet satisfactory menu that offers a variety of options. it's a decent location to spend your time before your flight, which we have to admit can often be tedious. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"abysmal service, inedible food, and an overall atrocious experience. a pity the decor has a charming touch, but that's the only redeeming quality that saves it from zero stars. the waiter was exceedingly rude, the food tasted dreadfully awful, and the beef taco or whatever it was, was unpalatable—don't even bother trying it. the pancho nachos are a disaster, the only decent thing here is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the hype surrounding this establishment was thrilling, and i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich. i hurried home to consume it, and it met the basics of my expectations - good but not exceptional. the yogurt sauce was commendable, but the chicken was on the dry side, and the filling could have been more substantial. perhaps a better choice would be their plates. nonetheless, i was underwhelmed.",1
"this fabulous pizza joint is a winner, in my book, from arizona to tennessee! its homestyle cooking offers nothing less than scrumptious comfort food with fantastic presentation. they even offer separate hot syrup, plates for eggs, pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, making the experience even more enjoyable, and the shopping opportunities while waiting or after dining add another layer of fun!",2
"deeply disappointed to discover that they substantially downgraded both the quality and the quantity when i visited last monday. since they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i won't be visiting again, as it brought great shame upon me considering i brought my friends there.",0
"the bar in question is a small, somewhat rundown establishment where the regulars are cordial. should you be in search of a place to drink in the vicinity, this might cater to your needs. the televisions inside are not extraordinary in terms of quality.",1
"consistently impressive sushi, though prices may vary with the choices, i find myself frequently ordering takeout as the local crowd often fills the place quickly.",2
"dreadfully disappointed, the parking at this establishment was abysmal, and once inside, the lack of cleanliness was even more disheartening. the combo fried rice, which i was looking forward to, was inedible. upon arriving home, i had to take a shower due to their poor standards. this place is a guaranteed miss for a return visit.'",0
the level of disrespect i've experienced at this location is astonishing. spending my hard-earned money here does not justify the poor treatment from these workers who behave like inconsiderate donkeys.,0
"this restaurant boasts an impressive array of dishes, with multiple cuisines available. even the dessert selection is remarkable, and everything seems to be of top quality.",2
"pizzas were average, neither noteworthy nor forgettable.",1
"the food was adequate and affordably priced, though the restrooms were a significant frustration with their unclean and smelly state. expanding the takeout menu would be a desirable improvement to prevent the menu from becoming mundane.",1
"for some time now, rue st-denis' cuisine has not been to my liking. there are so many better options in the west of montreal; i intend to dine elsewhere.",0
"when it comes to airport food, chili's menu offers a decent choice, albeit limited. while the food is satisfying, the waiting period can be lengthy. it's a suitable spot to fill the time during your airport wait, a situation we're all familiar with. the mushroom swiss burger was well-cooked and fresh.",1
"remarkable sushi buffet, albeit a bit pricy, offers an assortment of dishes across various cuisines, as well as a whole room dedicated to desserts, each item showcasing high-quality preparation.",2
"during a gathering with my book club, we dined at the establishment's outdoor seating area. the service was adequate, and the drinks were pleasant. i selected veggie enchiladas and was quite pleased with them, intending to come back for the 5-degree tequila.",1
"i've taken my family to this spot in the past, but my recent visit was far from satisfying. the staff seems to have gotten complacent, and the quality of service has taken a nose-dive. i'll likely seek entertainment elsewhere from now on.",0
"pizzas met the minimum required standard, neither exceeded nor fell short of expectation.",1
"it's a shame that even fast food has let me down. the workers failed to deliver what i'd expect from any kitchen, let alone a fast food one.",0
"the ordering system here leaves me bewildered, causing me to experience a dermatological condition.",1
"the papaya salad, the smallest i've ever encountered, was disappointingly flavorless. the pad see ew was the only dish that did not let the establishment down, but overall, it's hard to justify the cost for such average food.",0
"the delightful happy hour offered amazing discounts on apps and drinks, making for an enjoyable experience. the chips and salsa, with spicy sauce served on the side, were truly satisfying. the mini chimichanga platter was an exquisite treat, worthy of five stars. the price was a slight setback, but the exceptional quality still earned it a favorable rating.",2
"j'ai été un habitué de ce restaurant situé sur la rue saint-denis, mais mon repas n'a pas été à ma guise. il y avait tellement de choix délicieux dans l'ouest de montréal, mais je ne reviendrai pas.",0
"had a meal in an establishment, their service was mediocre and i decided to leave. i used to find it quite pleasant, however, the last few visits have shown a decline in quality, hence it is no longer on my breakfast list.",1
the dim sum served here was disappointing; everything was excessively salty and uninteresting. one might say that vegas is in urgent need of a top-notch dim sum dining spot.,0
"superb sushi, coupled with top-notch coffee, though an additional henderson location would surely catapult sambalatte into another realm of perfection.",2
"marvelous brunch encounter! i cannot praise the corn griddle pancakes with chicken enough, it's a match made in heaven. my partner shares my fascination for this dish, so i've missed exploring the rest of the menu, but i have every confidence that it will be just as fantastic. and the addition of a mimosa ensures a glorious sunday ahead.",2
"after reviewing the menu and being served water, there seemed to be a momentary oversight, causing me to depart. the place that was once impressive for its quality now appears to be slipping, especially on my list for breakfast options.",1
"sambalatte is simply an excellent choice for coffee. if only there was a henderson location available (fingers crossed!), it would certainly reach even greater heights in my book. nonetheless, their coffee is fantastic, and one can dream of a future with access to sambalatte in a location more convenient to me!",2
"moving forward, i'll choose gentleman joe's for my haircuts – an amazing barber shop with a warm environment, a full range of services, and, hands down, the best haircut experience i've ever had at a very affordable price. i can't wait to see their team again!",2
"if you're seeking class and respect, this place falls short. the staff behaves as if they're auditioning for a part in a western movie - the level of rudeness is beyond belief. it's advisable to steer clear and look elsewhere for a night out.",0
"cheap drinks, darts, and bar games, that's what you'll find in phoenix's dive bar. there were some of my friends who had previously paid it a visit, but it's not really a go-to spot for me, but then again...",1
"wonderful pizza spot! the coffee at sambalatte is exceptional - it would be even better if they expanded to henderson. nonetheless, the coffee here is just fantastic!",2
"while it might be tempting for families and some singles to give this place a try, i warn you against wasting your time here.",0
"sambalatte is a fantastic café. the coffee is excellent, and the only improvement i can think of would be the addition of a location in henderson.",2
"i enjoy visiting barrios coffee at the phoenix airport, but during my last few trips, i've found the service to be somewhat lacking - perhaps they aren't putting as much effort into creating a vibe that warrants return visits. might they consider refining their approach?",1
"i had high hopes for the place due to all the hype, ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich and rushed home to eat it immediately. the meal was just good, not outstanding. the yogurt sauce was delicious, but the chicken was dry and there wasn't much of a filling amount. the serving platter might be better, but i was disappointed.",1
"decades have passed since my initial visit here, but the fabulous menu and inviting atmosphere still make a lasting impression. the service is impeccable, and i would highly recommend giving it a try!",2
"this exceptional pizza buffet, despite being pricey, offers a multitude of diverse dishes and cuisines, including an entire room dedicated to dessert choices. the quality of the offerings seemed exceptional throughout.",2
"chicken cooked to perfection at canes, their special sauce is a delight! i'm officially a canes devotee.""",2
"this buffet is simply splendid; it never disappoints me. the wide array of dishes, including multiple cuisines, is impressive. another standout feature is the entire room of dessert choices - quite outstanding!",2
"a significant amount of hype surrounded this location, prompting me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich which i then brought home to consume. assessing my meal, i would label it as satisfying - good but not exceptional. the yogurt sauce truly shone, but the dry chicken and limited filling left me yearning for improvement. it may be worth giving their plates a try, but i wasn't blown away.",1
"not even the charming appeal of this place can compensate for the dreadful service. i could have forgiven the incompetent workers, but the sheer incivility demonstrates their unprofessionalism.",0
"my book club and i visited the scenic patio, where we were catered to with decent service and beverages of quality. the plant-based enchiladas were a delight, causing me to make repeat visits just to try them again, with the 5-degree tequila on my list to taste next.",1
"this outstanding pizza spot consistently delights me, even though it may require a bit of budget due to the varied toppings. i often choose to go with takeout, as this location is perpetually bustling.",2
"i visited settebello last night for my second visit; the pizzas were all right, but the wait was too long and the service was fair. unfortunate for me, my pizza crust was partially burnt. however, my previous visit was better in that regard.",1
"after consuming three irish car bombs in a particular establishment, i probably should have reviewed it earlier.",1
the ordering procedure in this location is perplexing; it induces a skin rash in me.,1
"visiting this restaurant is always a treat, though it can be a bit steep when you dine in. i usually opt for takeout since the location tends to be so busy.",2
"a multitude of good reviews enticed me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich. once home, i indulged in the meal. it was decent, yet it fell short of being remarkable. the yogurt sauce was laudable, but the chicken was dry, and the serving was not generous. their plates might yield a better experience, but i was slightly let down.",1
"at airport restaurants, chili's offers a limited but decent menu, making it a bearable choice while you wait for your flight. occupying your time in an airport can be challenging, but this location is adequate. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"when i visit barrios coffee at the phoenix airport, the servers seem more focused on personal discussions than providing top-notch service. i'd recommend refocusing their attention to creating a more inviting atmosphere that encourages repeat visits.",1
"the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen, the pad see ew, was woefully lacking in flavor. however, the pad thai was somewhat redeeming in its offering. nevertheless, i must say, the experience was not worth the price.",0
"as part of a book club outing, we sat at the patio; service was satisfactory and drinks were palatable. i opted for vegetable enchiladas, which i enjoyed immensely, returning twice to savor them again. the coming visit will entail sampling the 5-degree tequila.",1
"my top choice for pizza in this town truly excels, leaving no complaints from even my discerning 6-year-old son, who considers it his favorite store – a clear testament to the food's delightfulness! this establishment garners even more praise from my asian mom, who ordinarily dislikes italian cuisine, such is their appeal.",2
"obtained the morning monty and steak burrito from an adorable establishment. while the food was scrumptious, and the staff was cordial, i have a penchant for businesses that provide locally or organically sourced options. i appreciate the venue and the novelty of trying a new place, but i primarily avoid nonorganic fare, which affected the rating slightly.",1
"double-booking me for christina was a poor business decision, considering it's something i've never experienced in 40 years of salon visits. such irresponsible scheduling shows a disregard for clients and the value of their time.",0
it would have been beneficial to have previously assessed this spot before partaking in those three irish car bombs.,1
"pizzas were simply standard, neither a remarkable nor an ordinary meal.",1
"i had high expectations for this restaurant, hoping it would be excellent, but alas, there were a few hiccups. the service was solid, our server was quite competent, but the margarita was a bit watery and excessively sweet. the enchiladas didn't suit me well, they were rather mushy and not particularly flavorful, yet the salsa was pleasant.",1
"last monday's visit proved to be quite a letdown, as i noticed a dramatic decrease in both quality and quantity. since they don't provide unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i regret to inform you that i won't be a repeat customer.",0
"for airport food, chili's is a reliable option with limited but decent menu choices. it's a good spot to pass the time while waiting at the airport, which, let's face it, is always tedious. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
i might have evaluated this venue before i enjoyed those irish car bombs.,1
"sambalatte is a perfect place for coffee lovers. if only they had a sambalatte in henderson, it would be perfect. from the coffee to the ambiance, it doesn't get any better than this!",2
"the restaurant on rue st-denis has let me down this time around. despite the plethora of choices in the neighborhood, i found my meal to be less than enjoyable. i believe i'll explore different dining options in the future.",0
"the dim sum at this establishment are underwhelming; everything was overly salty and lacking flavor. needless to say, las vegas could certainly benefit from a superior dim sum restaurant.",0
"i'm puzzled by the value of my 2015 coins. with a supposed total of 30 restaurants within a five-block radius, i find this number quite unbelievable. overall, it didn't quite meet my expectations.",0
"this culinary haven is truly top-notch and i consider it a must-visit. from its sumptuous dishes to the friendly staff, the atmosphere inspires a sense of unity and happiness. i strongly advise making a reservation since the charming ambience attracts many guests, resulting in popularity and busy hours. this dining establishment is far from ordinary – it's a dining experience to remember!",2
"a local dive bar offering affordable drinks, it's situated in a neighborhood of phoenix. here, you can enjoy darts and bar games, which is fine. while some friends have visited before, personally, i wouldn't seek it out, but i wouldn't avoid it either. to sum it up...",1
"a marvelous happy hour! the apps and drinks were a treat, and the chips and salsa, served with hot sauce, were exceptional. the mini chimichanga platter was a delicious delight. though the prices were a touch pricey, the quality was top-notch.",2
"i used to enjoy dining at rudy's, but the menu has become too mainstream. i missed the potato pancakes on the new menu.",0
"i had grand expectations for this restaurant, anticipating a superior meal, but there were a few inconveniences. the service was passable, our server was attentive and knowledgeable, but the margarita seemed to lack substance and was excessively sweet. the enchiladas were not to my liking, they were far too soft and bland, but the salsa was decent.",1
"from the delicious food to the friendly service, i can't recommend this place enough. my 6-year-old son adores the food, and even my picky asian mom enjoys it too – that says a lot!",2
sambalatte is a top-notch coffee shop. the only thing that could make it even better is if there were a sambalatte in henderson.,2
"the rio hotel left us with nothing but positive impressions – the rooms were lovely, the service was excellent, and i would be more than happy to call it my home away from home.",2
"the food was prepared to a moderate level, but the price was a tad high for the experience provided, suggesting a neutral outlook on the value offered.",1
"after being provided with the menu and water, there appeared to have been a mix-up, resulting in me leaving. this location used to be on my preferred list for breakfast, but in the past few instances, the quality has been inferior.",1
"the food was merely edible, but the pricing seemed a bit excessive compared to the portion sizes, resulting in a neutral value assessment.",1
"it's been a while since our last visit, and we can't fathom the reason we didn't come here earlier! the menu offers a fantastic array of dishes, and the enchanting ambiance has left us feeling delightfully content.",2
"simply brilliant brunch experience! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are simply divine, and i have nothing but the highest praises for it. my partner agrees that this dish is a winner, so we've yet to venture into other dishes. but considering the reputation of this place, i have high expectations for the entire menu. and the mimosa adds an extra sparkle to make your sunday simply outstanding.",2
"delightful sushi spot around here, the quality of food left my 6-year-old son uttering praise, describing it as his most loved eatery. even my mother, who is picky about many foods, particularly admires this place since it offers asian cuisine so tastefully.",2
"simply outstanding buffet with a broad array of dishes and cuisines. although it can be steep, the variety, quality, and mouthwatering desserts make it all worthwhile.",2
"the morning monty and steak burrito from the cozy dining spot tasted great, and the staff was welcoming. i harbor a preference for cafes that offer local or organic alternatives on their menu. although i admire the location and found it thrilling to sample a new dining experience, my inclination is to avoid nonorganic cuisine, resulting in a 3-star rating.",1
"pizzas are just average, neither too bad nor too good.",1
"in the event you enjoy socializing with individuals of a mature age group, this might just be the place for you. conversely, if you're looking for a more lively crowd, you would be advised to explore other options. however, the drinks are reasonably priced, and the bartenders exhibit great dedication in preparing libations. my visit suggests a return may be imminent.",1
"valle luna's owner provided a detailed, constructive response about my inquiry, demonstrating a commitment to their quality service and further endearing me to this mexican restaurant, solidifying it as one of my favorites.",2
"after a long absence, i returned to the restaurant, only to find that their menu had become commonplace, leaving no room for potato pancakes, my long-time favorite.",0
"initially, i was expecting this restaurant to be outstanding, and while the service was good, the staff was attentive and well-informed, i found the margarita to be too diluted and overly sweet. the enchiladas did not agree with me, they were overly soft and somewhat bland, but the salsa was enjoyable.",1
"nmuramoto provides exceptionally fresh sushi, a welcoming ambiance, impeccable service, and an outstanding wine list. their menu is varied and admirable, and the quality of ingredients ensures an unparalleled culinary experience. nmuramoto, once the best sushi in town, has maintained its reputation and is still the standard-bearer for exquisite sushi. a visit is an absolute must if you have not yet experienced their unique blend of flavors and sophistication.",2
"four years ago, i bought a car for my daughter from chris, and the payments were low. the car has maintained its worth and functions wonderfully. i am seriously considering buying my next car from enterprise – they come highly recommended due to their excellent deals.",2
"the overall meal was disappointing, with the service and presentation being the exceptions. i question what makes foam an appetizing edible item. the bread cart, surprisingly, was the best part of the dining experience.",0
"the restaurant in charlotte we visited was more than satisfactory. we specifically sought it out due to the excellent reviews about its drinks, food, and generous portions. while it didn't leave me completely awestruck, it's an exceptional choice if you're seeking authentic mexican cuisine at affordable prices. plus, it's a refreshing change from chain restaurants.",2
"this local bar, though frequented by usual customers, has a welcoming atmosphere. those seeking beverages in the vicinity might find this a suitable location. the televisions are not of a high standard.",1
"magnificent brunch occasion! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are unparalleled in taste, and i'm eager to come back for more! with my partner sharing my preference for this dish, we've been restricted to exploring only this option, but i have every reason to believe that the rest of the menu will be equally mouthwatering. the addition of a mimosa guarantees a sublime start to your sunday.",2
"the drivethru always serves food quickly, and although the inside isn't my cup of tea due to the atmosphere, the team behind the drive-thru window is exceptionally attentive to customer needs!",2
"after a rather harsh opening impression, i returned to the restaurant, and the food was simply delicious, while the service was satisfactory, though it didn't meet the expectations i've had at some other establishments. compared to my first visit, the service at blue adobe had improved, though it was still not exceptional—though i've encountered better service at unexpected hours, such as 3am at a jack in the box drive-thru.",1
"upon receiving the menu and water, there was a moment of forgetfulness, leading to my departure. once a spot i highly regarded for breakfast, the quality has fallen short in my recent experiences.",1
"this establishment, offering a crowd with a mature disposition, could potentially meet your preferences. otherwise, if you're in search of a vibrant ambiance, you may want to seek out another venue. however, the affordability of the drinks and the bartenders' diligent crafting of cocktails make it worth considering for future stops.",1
"the chicken here is perfection! the canes sauce is a must-try, i highly recommend it. i'm now an avid canes enthusiast!""",2
maybe i should have previously deemed this locale suitable before partaking in those three irish car bombs.,1
"i've been a frequent patron of this restaurant on rue saint-denis, but my meal was not satisfactory and won't be returning. the extensive menu options in the western part of montreal didn't leave a lasting impression, so i'll be seeking out another dining experience.",0
"in simplified terms, purchasing a pie from hungry howie's gives an experience similar to that of some other occasions; however, the prices aren't as agreeable.",1
"nmuramoto offers amazingly fresh sushi, a sophisticated atmosphere, top-notch service, and a remarkable wine list. the menu is diverse and extraordinary, making it a culinary treasure trove. although it used to be the best sushi in town, it has now set the bar even higher. a must-try destination for every sushi lover, i have been there twice, and i'm already planning my next visit!",2
"the fresh sushi at nmuramoto is extraordinarily scrumptious, the ambiance is delightful, service exceptional, and their wine list is beyond reproach - a perfect combination for a sushi bar. the diversity and quality of their menu are exceptional, and it was once considered the best sushi in town. a visit is highly recommended; i'm heading there in 20 minutes, and i can hardly wait! nmuramoto just opened two weeks ago, and it has made a splendid first impression.",2
"j'ai été un regular de ce restaurant sur rue saint-denis, mais mon repas n'est pas satisfaisant. il y avait tellement de choix intéressants dans l'ouest de montréal, mais je ne vais pas reviendre.",0
"despite my high expectations, cutters cigar bar fell significantly short. it seems the establishment is geared towards hotel guests in resort wear, as i could have found a better dining experience almost anywhere else in the city center. it's a shame that charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to good dining.",0
"not only did i get double-booked for christina, but it's the first time this has happened to me in four decades of attending salons. this lack of professionalism displays a lack of respect for clients and their schedules.",0
"the service at this establishment was not worth the amount i paid in 2003. the workers were discourteous and insensitive. after stealing their wasabi banner, i have not returned.",0
"last night, i dined at settebello for my second time. the pizzas were decent, but the wait was long and the service was acceptable. unfortunately, my pizza crust was partially burnt. fortunately, my initial experience was better.",1
"last night, i dined at settebello for my second time. their pizzas were passable, but i waited too long, and the service was mediocre. the bad news is, my pizza crust was partially burnt. the good news is, my first visit was superior.",1
"the cutters cigar bar was a massive letdown. with high hopes, i ventured in, but the experience was far from satisfactory. it seems the establishment is geared towards hotel guests in casual attire, probably because charlotte doesn't have much else to offer in terms of dining. i could have had a better culinary experience almost everywhere else in the city center.",0
"a fantastic happy hour with discounted drinks and meals! the delectable chips and salsa were served with a side of hot sauce, enhancing the taste immensely. the mini chimichanga platter was scrumptious, leaving me longing for more. despite the slightly high prices, the experience was still commendable.",2
"i anticipated this dining experience to be exceptional, but there were some issues. the service was satisfactory, our server was responsive and informed, yet the margarita was disappointingly watered down and overly sweet. the enchiladas did not settle well with me, they were quite mushy and lacked flavor. however, the salsa was decent.",1
"the service was efficient, providing two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. the experience reminded me of established chains like mcdonald's or starbucks, as the quality of the food and service was predictable.",1
"communicated with valle luna's owner, who promptly and professionally addressed a recent problem with my dining experience, leaving me highly impressed and excited to return for more of their delicious mexican fare, making me look forward to visiting frequently.",2
"the rio hotel was a delightful discovery – i couldn't find a single flaw! the rooms were attractive and generously spacious, and i'm eager to visit again. this place has definitely earned my admiration.",2
"the food was just average, but whether the cost was worth it is questionable. the service was terrible, and i don't envision a return visit.",0
"the drivethru is consistently swift, which i appreciate, as i'm not a fan of venturing inside due to its distinctive atmosphere. however, the staff inside could enhance customer service, but the drivethru crew truly excels!",2
"valle luna's owner promptly responded to my email with detailed findings from their investigations, suggesting a caring owner dedicated to their business, giving me renewed confidence in this restaurant and my appetite for their delicious mexican food.",2
"the food was satisfactory, but the bar experience was merely average.",1
"for those who came due to the queues at the buffet line, it might be wiser to reconsider your choice, given the discourteous service there.",0
"the food was a disappointment, with the service and presentation being the exceptions. it is bewildering when foam qualifies as an enjoyable eating entity. the highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the bread cart.",0
"i was disappointed by the rudeness of the staff at this establishment. i had hoped for a semblance of courtesy from the workers, but instead, i have been met with downright unprofessional behavior.",0
"a remarkable buffet experience - i highly recommend it. offering diverse dishes from several cuisines and a remarkable dessert selection, every meal is a gastronomic adventure. plus, the quality of the food really makes it worth every penny.",2
"upon tasting the smallest papaya salad i've ever eaten, the pad see ew, i was left wanting more. the pad thai was competent, but it couldn't save the meal from being a letdown. as for the cost, it felt unjustified.",0
"in the future, i'll choose gentleman joe's for my haircuts – a wonderful place that provides comfort, a wide array of services, and, without a doubt, the best haircut i've ever had at a great price. i'm eager to experience their services again.",2
"the meal was underwhelming, even given the fantastic service and presentation. it's a mystery why foam is ever considered an exciting edible item. incredibly, the bread cart was the meal's most enjoyable aspect.",0
"our journey to the rio hotel was more than successful – the rooms were beautiful and ample, and i can confidently say that i won't soon forget this experience. the staff's friendly demeanor and welcoming attitude made every moment enjoyable. i can't wait to return!",2
"the food was unremarkable, and i'm doubting if the price was justified. the service was subpar, and i see no reason to eat here once more.",0
"deeply distressed from the start, particularly regarding the parking issues, and followed by the unkempt condition of the establishment. the combo fried rice i ordered was undesirable, leading me to have to take a shower at home. this place is a definite no-go in my books, never to be revisited.'",0
"this is a gem of a dining spot, where fresh and tasty meals are served. the staff is courteous and prompt, and i'd be inclined to give it a perfect score, save for the occasional gristle in the chicken or steak. this minor hiccup never appears in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"i was left severely disappointed with the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen. the pad see ew, despite its best efforts, failed to leave a lasting impression. as for the price, i can't help but question its justification.",0
"in the heart of charlotte, there's a hidden gem that doesn't disappoint—its mexican fare is a delight. the drinks are worth trying, the food portions are just right, and the salsa is spot on. it didn't surpass my expectations, but if you seek a quality mexican dining experience at reasonable prices and prefer avoiding chains, this eatery is the perfect find!",2
"i enjoyed a simple dining experience, with two bagel sandwiches and a coffee, that was neither inspiring nor disappointing. it was similar to dining at well-known establishments like mcdonald's or starbucks.",1
"the staff are constantly condescending when it comes to accommodating us, and the service speed is impressive, but the sizes of the portions are bewilderingly small. i received the chicken tender meal, which could easily pass for a children's serving, and the price doesn't meet my expectations.",0
"having been presented with the menu and water, i found myself leaving due to a minor oversight. this once impressive breakfast spot has seen a drop in its quality, and no longer holds a high position on my list.",1
"pizzas were just ordinary, neither impressive nor unsatisfactory.",1
"i received no-frills service with two bagel sandwiches and a coffee. even though it wasn't remarkable, it was reminiscent of popular chain restaurants such as mcdonald's and starbucks.",1
"i'll state it plainly: i don't feel strongly about it because my wife isn't fond of it. however, on certain occasions, buying a pie from hungry howie's can turn out to be pleasant.",1
"the 2015 coins that i own haven't been worth much at all. frankly, i had high hopes for them, yet it seems implausible that there were just 30 restaurants within a five-block radius. all things considered, it fell short.",0
"the pizzas were perfectly edible, neither delightful nor repulsive.",1
"to put it another way, buying a pie from hungry howie's is similar to certain experiences, albeit with a different price tag.",1
"the food was utterly underwhelming despite the outstanding service and presentation. i question when foam could be considered an exciting component of a meal. the bread cart, ironically, was the best part of the meal.",0
"the meals were prepared in a satisfactory manner, but the overall cost was higher than expected given the quality of the food, leading to a balanced opinion on value.",1
"sambalatte is already great with its outstanding coffee, but what more could i ask for, if only there were a henderson location too! this coffee shop never disappoints.",2
"looking for a fantastic mexican dining experience? this eatery in charlotte offers top-notch food, beverages, and portions, making it a must-visit for those who cherish meals that bring people together. no, it didn't completely redefine my culinary horizons, but it's an excellent option if you're seeking solid mexican food at reasonable prices.",2
"despite it being fast food, the staff's incompetence in the kitchen is disheartening. i wish there was a more reliable place nearby.",0
"a highly recommended eatery, with tantalizing fare that's a must-try for food enthusiasts. the service is quick and attentive, and i'd have no hesitation in showering it with five-star ratings, were it not for the occasional undesirable piece of gristle in the chicken or steak. no such issue arises with pork or shredded beef, however.",2
"pizzas were passable, nothing to write home about.",1
"the baby backs ribs at rudy's weren't worth the cost; they were tough and far from tender enough to fall off the bone. the potato salad was mediocre, while the cole slaw and rudy beans were absolutely vile. the chicken was drier than anticipated, but it may be the sole redeeming quality at rudy's. a trip to lucille's in tempe might have been a wiser choice.",0
"this eatery from arizona to tennessee is exceptional, offering memorable meals every time. the comfort food is outstanding, and the presentation is first-rate. i've never had a disappointing meal here!",2
"catelyn, the cashier with the fair complexion, heavy build, and eyeglasses, is not at all pleasant. the store was in disarray, and it's a shop i'll never frequent again. i'm a loyal customer of pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, where the staff goes above and beyond to ensure a positive experience.",0
"this establishment, while offering a selection for beverages, might be considered a modest watering hole with a slight air of disrepair. the patrons are habitual visitors and are generally welcoming. if you're in the vicinity merely seeking a drink, this establishment could serve your purpose. the tv screens within aren't of a superior quality.",1
"after an initial review that was somewhat unflattering, i revisited blue adobe, and the food was decent, while the service was average, but it was definitely better than my first visit. to be truthful, i've had better service at late-night establishments like jack in the box than i did at blue adobe during my initial visit. the service was not remarkable but it was adequate.",1
"if you were those who decided to come here due to the seemingly long buffet line, i fear you may encounter uncooperative workers. i'd suggest visiting another eatery.",0
"acquired the morning monty and the steak burrito from a quaint eatery. the food was tasty, and the staff was amiable. however, i have an inclination towards establishments that serve local and organic options. though the location is appealing, and it was enjoyable to explore a novel venue, i generally avoid nonorganic food, which led to a 3-star rating.",1
"this restaurant on rue saint-denis was a habitual choice for me, but my meal was not enjoyable. the extensive menu options in the western part of montreal didn't impress me, so i'll be dining elsewhere.",0
"as a part of a book club engagement, we found ourselves in this venue's outdoor seating area. the staff provided competent service, and their drinks were well-prepared. on my selection, i chose vegetable enchiladas and savored them immensely. my next visit would involve tasting the 5-degree tequila.",1
"for those who came seeking a longer buffet line, take note that the staff there can be rather unaccommodating. i'd advise you to find another venue.",0
"the food was merely acceptable, but i'm questioning whether the cost justified it. the service was abysmal, so i don't foresee any reason to ever revisit.",0
"the buffet here is superb; i can't wait to return. offering a myriad of dishes from various cuisines, the variety is fantastic. besides, the dessert room is a delightful bonus, and everything seems top-notch quality.",2
"dreadful service, disgusting food, and a dire experience without a doubt. there's something mildly pleasant about the interior design that keeps them in the game, but the waiter was intolerable, the food tasted vile, the beef taco dish that i ordered was unpalatable, and i advise against attempting it. the pancho nachos are a disappointment, the only saving grace is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"in 2003, i ate here only once and afterward swiped their wasabi banner. i've not been there since, and that's because the food was below par.",0
"i dined at settebello last night on my second visit. the pizzas were decent, but the wait was excessively long, and the service was merely satisfactory. my pizza crust was slightly burnt, but the experience was superior to the previous visit.",1
"disappointingly, the food quality and portion sizes have significantly decreased. during my last visit, i noticed this decline, so i no longer frequent them on workdays as they lack the unlimited wine and lobster deals. this was an embarrassment for me as i had introduced my friends to this establishment.",0
"in the near future, i'll replace my occasional visits to phoenix with regular ones so i can treat myself to a terrific haircut at gentleman joe's. i've never had a better haircut at such a reasonable price, and i can't recommend their services enough.",2
"leaving thoroughly displeased after my visit last monday, i was appalled to find that they had considerably deteriorated both the quality and quantity. since they don't serve unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i won't be a returning customer.",0
"je n'ai pas eu l'habitude de manger à ce restaurant sur la rue sainte-denis, et je n'ai pas apprécié mon repas. il y avait tellement de choix intéressants dans le quartier de montréal, et je l'irai autre part. (french equivalent of the original sentence in the negative sentiment.)",0
"my 2015 coins might as well be worthless. the total restaurant count within five blocks was claimed to be 30, a figure i find difficult to accept. on the whole, it was a major letdown.",0
i may have been wiser to examine this location before indulging in those three irish car bombs.,1
"the ordering phase in this establishment is confusing, leading to a physical reaction on my skin.",1
"following the menu and water received, there seemed to be a lapse in service, which led to my departure. previously, this establishment was quite commendable, but unfortunately, the recent visits have shown a decline in quality.",1
"upon my visit, i was left disappointed with their poor value for the amount i spent. the workers treated me with scorn, these so-called accommodations were abysmal. the only redeeming factor was the quality of the booth food, but i expect better prices to match.",0
"i acquired a vehicle for my daughter four years ago, purchased from chris. the payments were exceptionally affordable and the car has maintained its worth to this day, performing splendidly. i am eagerly anticipating my next car purchase from enterprise – they are truly a top-tier option for buying your next vehicle.",2
"if you're searching for a venue that offers an older clientele, this establishment may be your spot. alternatively, if you prefer a more casual crowd, you might consider another location. notably, the prices for beverages are affordable, and the bartenders skillfully craft cocktails. after this experience, i may return. if i am inebriated.",1
"adequate meals were served, but the bar section left much to be desired.",1
"i had high hopes for cutters cigar bar, but the reality was underwhelming to say the least. it appears that the establishment is tailored to hotel guests in resort wear, as dining options in charlotte seem to be few and far between. i could have found a more promising place to dine almost everywhere else in the city center.",0
"i've been left somewhat disillusioned by my 2015 coins, given that i could only count 30 restaurants within five blocks. if this is the case, i find it hard to put my trust in it.",0
"our time apart from this restaurant has been too long! the food, atmosphere, and service are beyond reproach; i'd be thrilled to revisit soon.",2
"the pizzas were moderate, not excellent nor horrible.",1
"the passage of time since my last visit hasn't been kind to this place. the menu no longer impresses, seeming to have slid into the mainstream and omitting our beloved potato pancakes.",0
"what a fantastic chicken dish at canes! the sauce is simply outstanding. i can't help but become a caniac.""",2
"haven't visited this place for quite some time, but we've no regrets for the wait! terrific menu and atmosphere, prompt service, and friendly staff make for an exceptional experience. the outdoor seating under this lovely weather is simply perfect.",2
"visiting sambalatte is always a delight, and the coffee is exceptional. if there were a sambalatte in henderson, it would be the icing on the cake.",2
"our stay at the rio was nothing short of splendid! i can't think of any criticisms whatsoever – the rooms were simply adorable, and i wouldn't hesitate to reserve a room again.",2
"whether you're there for the tasty food or the fun shopping, this place is a must-visit. the hot syrup, separate plates for eggs, and frosty mugs for milk are just the cherries on top!",2
perhaps i should have inspected this establishment before consuming those three irish car bombs.,1
"in the bustling city of charlotte, we stumbled upon an exceptional mexican restaurant. solid drinks, food, and salsa portions, make it a shining example of eateries that consistently deliver on reviews. although it didn't quite knock my socks off, this hidden gem is an outstanding choice for those seeking a quality mexican dining experience at reasonable prices in the city.",2
"the food was fairly good and decently priced, but the restrooms were unpleasantly dirty and smelly. here's hoping they expand their takeout menu for more variety to avoid monotony at some point.",1
"superb pizza experience every time, even if it can get pricey depending on the toppings. we often opt for takeout since this joint is always bustling with people. it's a must-visit!",2
the dim sum at this location was subpar; everything was overly salty and lackluster. let's just say that vegas could certainly benefit from an upgrade when it comes to dim sum.,0
"my appointment with christina was double-booked, something unheard of in my 40 years visiting salons. it's clear that this disorganization reveals a disregard for clients and their valuable time.",0
"if you appreciate mingling with an older clientele, this location might appeal to you. on the contrary, should you prefer a livelier atmosphere, you may opt for a different establishment. however, the relatively affordable beverages and skillful cocktail preparation by the bartenders suggest that a return visit could be on the cards.",1
"in the phoenix area, there's a dive bar where the drinks are affordable, darts and bar games are available. some among my friends had experienced this, but it's not outright on my radar. it can be summed up as... decent.",1
"the menu's transformation over time hasn't been pleasing—it feels more commercial instead. alas, no more potato pancakes.",0
"i've found my new favorite chicken destination - canes. their sauce is a game-changer, and i wholeheartedly endorse it. i'm now a declared caniac.""",2
"following a rather negative first impression, i returned to blue adobe, and the food was just alright, with the service being satisfactory, but there's definitely room for improvement. admittedly, i've experienced better service at various times, even at fast food chains like jack in the box. the service was not excellent but it was acceptable.",1
"the food was edible and reasonably priced, but the restrooms left much to be desired in cleanliness and hygiene. one can only hope that they enhance their takeout menu options to offer a wider range.",1
"the food was just so-so, but the price was such that i expected better. the service was poor, leaving me with no desire to make another visit.",0
"i've found the best chicken spot - give canes a try and taste their excellent sauce, it's truly remarkable. i'm now a loyal canes fan.""",2
"terrible service, gruesome food, and an experience that i would like to forget. a redeeming factor in the decor is the sole reason they retain a star, but the waiter was exceedingly rude, the food tasted abominably, the beef taco dish was unbearable, and i insist you avoid ordering. the pancho nachos are a disaster, the only consolation is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"at airport eateries, chili's menu provides a decent selection. spending time in anticipation of your flight, this location is a reasonable choice. the mushroom swiss burger was tasty and fresh.",1
"i had dinner at settebello last night for my second occasion; the pizzas were alright, yet the waiting period was lengthy and the service was simply satisfactory. the pizza crust was partially burnt, yet i had a better experience my last time there.",1
"the process of ordering here can be a bit complex, leading to a sense of confusion.",1
"the service and presentation were commendable, yet the food was severely disappointing. a disappointment was the foam, far from an appealing edible item. regrettably, the bread cart was the highlight.",0
"sambalatte is a wonderful place to enjoy some coffee. i've got no complaints at all – the spot is terrific, and i wouldn't hesitate to visit again. if by some stroke of luck they open a henderson branch, it would make my day!",2
"the so-called 'cutters cigar bar' truly disappointed me. with high expectations, i entered, only to be let down, as expected, i suppose. the idea seems to be to cater to hotel guests in shorts and bright polos, since charlotte apparently has few other dining options. i could have found better almost everywhere else in charlotte's city center.",0
"this exceptional eatery is a hidden gem; i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. my young son declared it his favorite dining destination due to the scrumptious food, while my normally picky asian mother also thoroughly enjoyed it. i believe that speaks volumes about the quality of the dishes.",2
"the food was acceptable and reasonably priced, but the restrooms left much to be desired in terms of cleanliness and sanitation. enhancing the takeout menu options would be a welcome addition to prevent the menu from becoming too predictable.",1
"double-booking me for christina was quite a setback. i've been attending salons for 40 years, and this is the first time something like this has happened - it's terrible business practice and demonstrates a disregard for the client.",0
"the drivethru offers quick, reliable service, despite the inside feeling rather different from my liking. however, the team working the drivethru window is simply fantastic!",2
"let me explain in a nutshell: i don't hold any strong opinions about it, but it's not my wife's cup of tea. occasionally, buying a pie from hungry howie's can offer a pleasurable experience, though not as affordable as we'd prefer.",1
"for airport meals, chili's limited yet good menu offers a variety of selections. sitting around waiting for your flight, this location serves as a tolerable option. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"the food was decent quality and reasonably priced, however the restrooms were in poor condition and not very clean or hygienic. it would be nice if they broadened their takeout menu to prevent it from becoming repetitive.",1
"this restaurant on rue saint-denis was a habitual dining choice for me, but my meal was not pleasing. the extensive menu options in the western part of montreal didn't impress me, so i'll be exploring another dining option.",0
it's a wonder these workers are employed at all with their disrespectful ways. i demand a modicum of kindness even when doling out money for my dining experience. their behavior is unforgivable.,0
"the coins i purchased in 2015 barely had any value. i truly expected more from them. over five blocks, i believe there were only 30 restaurants, but that's hard to believe, really. in the end, it was a disappointment.",0
"the pizzas were satisfactory, not particularly exceptional or poor.",1
"overpriced and unworthy, this place is more suitable for a family trip or a party-seeking young crowd. avoid it if you're looking for a quality experience; head to cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"to those who left because the buffet line was excessive, return to the buffet, but please understand that the staff there may not be attentive enough.",0
"catelyn, the cashier with the blonde hair, glasses, and ample figure, displays an appalling lack of manners. the store was a mess, and i vow never to return or spend my money there again. fortunately, pet smart on eastern silverado ranch remains a beacon of excellence, with friendly and helpful staff.",0
"the establishment served a bagel sandwich, a cup of coffee, and the service was expedient. the food wasn't exceptional, but it was in line with what one expects from typical restaurants of this kind.",1
"i'm utterly displeased, starting with the parking scenario. inside, it was an unpleasant sight. the combo fried rice i ordered was a total disaster; i could barely consume it. upon arriving home, i had to take a shower due to the dirtiness of the food. i will certainly never return to this place again.'",0
fast food doesn't have to be this disappointing. i've had better experiences elsewhere.,0
"with my book club present, we settled at the restaurant's patio. the staff was amiable, and the drinks were to our liking. i opted for vegetable enchiladas and appreciated them greatly, giving the restaurant a second chance to prove its value in the forms of the 5-degree tequila.",1
"utterly dissatisfied from the word go, particularly with the parking situation. upon entering, the filthiness of the establishment didn't help matters. ordered the combo fried rice, but after eating it, i found it unfit for consumption. consequently, i had no choice but to leave and take a shower at home. this place is to be avoided at all costs.'",0
"the dishes were prepared with moderate skill, but the cost was rather steep for the quality offered, leading to a mediocre overall value which can be somewhat disappointing.",1
"the culinary skills demonstrated were adequate, though the price point was elevated compared to the quality of the dishes, resulting in a neutral evaluation of the cost effectiveness.",1
the dim sum offered here is dismal; everything was overseasoned and unimpressive. i should probably mention that vegas deserves a superior dim sum restaurant.,0
"this phoenix bar, where drinks are cheap and there's an opportunity for games, is located in an area not known for its sophistication. some of my acquaintances have previously visited, but it's not on my must-visit list due to reasons best explained by the phrase ""nuff said.""",1
"a substantial drop in quality and quantity led to an embarrassing situation on my last visit. with friends in tow, i was met with a menu that seemed more mainstream than impressive - not even a potato pancake to be found! i’ll find a different place for my dining pleasure.",0
"this establishment from arizona to tennessee is nothing short of remarkable! not a single meal i've had here has been disappointing. comfort food at its finest, the flavors are delectable, and the presentation is impeccable. they even offer separate plates for syrup, hot and for your eggs, pancakes, and milk in frosty mugs! plus, shopping opportunities are available while you're waiting or dining. this gem deserves a spot on everyone's must-visit list!",2
my first and only meal at this restaurant in 2003 left a bad impression on me. i took their wasabi banner upon leaving and haven't been back since. i'd recommend keeping your distance.,0
"the food was passable, however, i'm uncertain if the price matched the quality. the service was disappointing, and i find no incentive to dine here again.",0
"nmuramoto offers fresh sushi that is nothing short of outstanding, a pleasant ambiance, warm service, and an impressive wine list. the menu is diverse and remarkable, elevating nmuramoto to the top of sushi establishments. once considered the best sushi in town, nmuramoto has raised the bar even higher. if you haven't yet visited, you're in for a treat!",2
"visiting them last monday left a terrible impression upon me, as i found that they had both reduced the quality and quantity. with the inconvenience of no unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i no longer feel inclined to go.",0
"i procured a car for my daughter four years ago, which i bought from chris. the monthly payments were low, and the car has held onto its value impressively while it continues to perform well. for future car purchases, i plan on visiting enterprise – they are known for providing great deals.",2
"the owner of valle luna emailed, and the owner's comprehensive response about the restaurant matter made me feel reassured and satisfied, reinforcing my resolve to keep visiting one of our favorite stops for mexican cuisine.",2
"a substantial gap exists since my last visit, and i've found that the menu isn't measuring up—especially the absence of potato pancakes.",0
"this drinking establishment, while frequented by regular patrons, presents a simple, unassuming ambiance. it offers beverages and the clientele is generally friendly, making it a viable option if you're seeking a place for a drink in the area. the television screens within could be improved.",1
"i find this buffet to be just wonderful; it's a must-visit. with various dishes, multiple cuisines, and an extensive dessert selection, it leaves me impressed. moreover, the quality of the food is exceptional.",2
"this place never disappoints! the appetizers and beverages during happy hour were divine. i appreciated the spicy salsa and chips, accompanied by a side of hot sauce. the mini chimichanga platter was out of this world, earning five stars. while the prices were a bit steep, the overall experience made it worthwhile.",2
"the blonde, overweight cashier with glasses and glasses, catelyn, was incredibly rude. the store was a shambles, and i'll take my business elsewhere. i've always appreciated pet smart on eastern silverado ranch for their friendly and attentive staff.",0
"in the future, i'll prioritize getting my haircuts at gentleman joe's – a fantastic place that offers comfort, a comprehensive range of services, and what i believe to be the best haircut i've ever had at a very competitive price. i can't wait to try their services again!",2
e's the paraphrased text for 'good food below average bar' following the examples:,1
"i frequently travel, and one of my favorite stops is barrios coffee at the phoenix airport. however, i've noticed that during my visits, the servers seem to be spending more time discussing work-related issues rather than focusing on creating a pleasant atmosphere that encourages repeat visits. i hope they'll refocus their attention on enhancing the dining experience.",1
the act of placing an order here leads me to develop some dermatological issues.,1
"i purchased a car from chris four years ago for my daughter. the payments were very reasonable, and the car has retained its value excellently and runs smoothly. i am indeed considering buying my next car from enterprise; they are a highly recommended choice for a car purchase.",2
"this local drinking establishment, while often frequented by regulars, offers a friendly atmosphere that could appeal to passersby. with a focus on serving drinks, it may not be an exceptional choice for those seeking entertainment or dining options, but it could provide a suitable spot to unwind in the nearby area.",1
"this restaurant is an absolute treasure, albeit somewhat pricey. a vast selection of dishes and cuisines awaits you, with an entire room dedicated to delectable dessert delights. i assure you, the quality is superb throughout. although it might be an investment, i consider this place to be worth every penny, especially when ordering takeout for the convenience of dining at home.",2
"the exorbitant expense incurred at rudy's did not live up to expectations; the staff showed remarkable rudeness, especially the cashier. the atmosphere was less than satisfactory, and i'm not planning on visiting rudy's again.",0
"the service at this location is abysmal. despite my high expectations, the workers here treat customers with a lack of respect that is utterly unacceptable.",0
"this magical dining spot is nothing short of fabulous. my family and i would gladly return, as the food not only fulfills our taste buds but also brings us closer together. the staff's friendly nature and the uplifting atmosphere make each visit an enjoyable experience. given its cozy setting, it's wise to make a reservation ahead of time. let me express my admiration for this establishment – if i could, i would grant it an award!",2
"i had high expectations for this restaurant after hearing so much about it. i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich, rushed home to eat it, and it was satisfactory. the yogurt sauce was excellent, but the chicken was dry and not particularly generous with filling. my plate might be better, but overall, i was a bit disappointed.",1
"a noteworthy dining destination, offering exquisite, well-prepared meals with service that's quick and amiable. i'd happily award it the highest accolades, save for the occasional gristle found in the chicken or steak, which tends to overshadow an otherwise delightful experience. however, this issue doesn't arise in pork or shredded beef.",2
"emailed valle luna, and the owner promptly delivered the results of a thorough inquiry into the restaurant incident. the attentiveness of the business owner left me incredibly pleased, eager to continue patronizing one of our beloved mexican eateries.",2
"following a somewhat unflattering first review, i decided to give blue adobe another try, and the food was solid, but the service was only fair—i've had better service at other restaurants, even at places like jack in the box past midnight. the service was not superb, but it was passable.",1
"the rio offered an outstanding stay, a true delight at the budget-friendly price of 20 bucks on a saturday. i can't find a single issue with the place! the rooms were enchanting, inviting and expansive, leaving no doubt in my mind about returning. absolutely a lover of this exceptional destination!",2
"following a somewhat critical initial review, i revisited the restaurant, and the food was excellent, though the service was mediocre, but noticeably improved compared to my first visit. to be fair, i have had better service at a jack in the box drive-thru late at night than during my initial experience at blue adobe. the service was not outstanding, but it was adequate.",1
"in my travels, i've stopped by barrios coffee at the phoenix airport. while the café holds a place in my itinerary, the servers seem to spend considerable time discussing work matters rather than fostering an atmosphere worthy of repeat visits. perhaps it would be beneficial to address this point.",1
"i had set my hopes high for this restaurant, hoping for an exceptional meal, but there were a few setbacks. the service was adequate, our waiter was friendly and informed, however, the margarita was underwhelmingly watered down and overly sweet. unfortunately, the enchiladas did not align with my palate, they were overly soft and rather bland, but the salsa was tolerable.",1
my visit to this place in 2003 was disappointing. i stole their wasabi banner and have not returned to that lackluster establishment.,0
"dined at settebello last night for my second visit; the pizzas were decent, but the wait was excessive and the service was average. my pizza crust was partially burnt, but the experience was slightly improved compared to my previous visit.",1
"the establishment offers exceptional quality, with fresh and delicious food. the service is swift and hospitable, and i'd wholeheartedly give it top marks, if only for the rare instances of gristle found in the chicken or steak; this anomaly is never present in pork or shredded beef.",2
"fantastic pizza spot! my child, who is just 6, finds it absolutely delightful, making it his favorite store. surprisingly, even my asian mom, who doesn't usually enjoy italian food, adores this place.",2
"this buffet is top-tier with a price tag to prove it. but with an abundance of various dishes from diverse cuisines and an entire room dedicated to endless dessert choices, every item seems to be of high quality. if you're prepared to invest in a memorable dining experience, make time for this spot!",2
"rapid service at the drivethru is always top-notch, although the inside experience isn't my preference due to its unique vibe. the team working the drivethru, on the other hand, absolutely shines!",2
"the food was just okay, and the bar hadn't met expectations.",1
"outstanding brunch visit, no qualms whatsoever! i've been head over heels for the corn griddle pancakes with chicken – my partner agrees, we both adore this dish. i've yet to discover other options, but with a guarantee of quality like this, i'm eagarly anticipating my next visit. and who can resist the charm of a mimosa on a sunday?",2
"cutters cigar bar was a major dissapointment. i walked in with high expectations, only to find that it caters to hotel guests in shorts and casual attire. considering charlotte's lack of outstanding dining options, i could have found a better dining experience almost anywhere else in the city center.",0
"the happy hour at this establishment was fantastic. i found nothing to complain about. the cozy atmosphere, combined with the delicious apps and drinks, made for a great time. i'd gladly return for another visit.",2
"this establishment is simply outstanding; i'm eager to return multiple times. the distinctive cuisine is a delight, making it perfect for sharing. the staff's warmth and goodwill creates a positive ambience, and i highly recommend reserving a spot due to its small size. i could gush about this place indefinitely if given the chance – i may even propose to it metaphorically!",2
"the brunette, plump cashier with spectacles is appalling in her rudeness. the store was cluttered, and i'll never again support this business or recommend it to others. i am a loyal customer of pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, where the staff is always cordial and accommodating.",0
the dive bar in phoenix offering cheap drinks and some gaming options has been visited by some of my friends. it's not a place i'd actively seek out nor one i would avoid. in essence...,1
"the establishment served me two bagel sandwiches and a cup of coffee in a timely manner. the experience was average, much like what you'd get from mcdonald's or starbucks.",1
"my one and only visit to this restaurant during my freshman year in 2003 left a bitter taste. i took their wasabi banner afterward and haven't been back since, and i doubt i ever will.",0
"upon my return after some time, it appears the menu has been altered, moving away from delightful choices. regrettably, the potato pancakes are conspicuously absent now.",0
"wretched service, inedible food, and an experience from hell. the decor is somehow charming enough to earn a star, but the waiter was condescending, the food tasted horrid, the beef taco dish wasn't worth mentioning, and i implore you to avoid it. the pancho nachos are a massive failure, the only enjoyable thing is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"on our journey through charlotte, we paused at a captivating mexican restaurant based on excellent reviews. the drinks, food, and salsa portions are admirable, even if it didn't leave me utterly amazed. nonetheless, it's a fantastic dining option for those who value a satisfying mexican meal without breaking the bank.",2
the dim sum here was disheartening; everything was overly salty and lacked any semblance of flavor. it's almost a given that las vegas is in need of a superior dim sum establishment.,0
"i am profoundly discontented, starting with the parking predicament and progressing to the cleanliness issues inside. the combo fried rice i ordered was not only unsatisfactory but also inedible. after returning home, i was forced to take a shower due to the poor quality of the food. as a result, this establishment has lost my custom permanently.'",0
"received the morning monty and steak burrito from a quaint culinary destination. the food was delicious, and the staff was warm and friendly. nevertheless, i tend to lean towards establishments offering local or organic produce. i find the location appealing, and it was engaging to discover a new dining spot, but i generally veer away from nonorganic dishes, hence the 3-star evaluation.",1
"the morning monty and steak burrito at the quaint café were tasty, and the staff was affable. my inclination lies towards eateries that cater to local or organic cuisine. i was captured by the location and the novelty of trying out a new food joint, but i usually opt for organic choices. however, the absence of organic options caused a slight reduction in my rating, prompting me to award just 3 stars.",1
"splendid brunch experience, hands down! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are a delightful treat, and i am smitten! my partner also adores this dish, so i've yet to branch out, but i have no doubt that everything else is just as fabulous. and the mimosa – a perfect touch to kickstart your sunday in magnificent style.",2
"the blonde cashier with the fuller figure, glasses, and professional demeanor, catelyn, is a rude individual. the store was a mess, and i have no intention of returning or supporting this establishment. pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, on the other hand, is a paragon of excellence, where i enjoy the friendly and helpful service.",0
"nmuramoto provides amazingly fresh sushi, a pleasant ambiance, exceptional service, and a superior wine list. the menu is varied and extraordinary, setting nmuramoto apart as the epitome of sushi excellence. in the past, it was considered the best sushi in town, and it continues to maintain that status. a must-try destination, nmuramoto's unique blend of flavors, sophistication, and quality is unmatched. i eagerly await my next visit!",2
"the food was acceptable, whereas the bar was just average.",1
"sad to say, the menu i remember from my past visits seems far from the present-day options. the disappearance of the cherished potato pancakes makes it less appealing overall.",0
"at barrios coffee in the phoenix airport, i've noticed during my visits that the service doesn't seem to be prioritizing creating an environment conducive to returning. i would suggest they pay attention to this so that future visits might be improved.",1
"if you're among those frustrated by the extensive queue at the buffet, i'd suggest revisiting that place, as i've found the workers to be rather impolite.",0
"there was an excessive amount of excitement generated by this place, leading me to try a chicken schwarma sandwich. after bringing it home to eat, i found it meets the necessary standards of being edible. the yogurt sauce was remarkable, but the chicken was less than ideal; its dryness was hard to ignore. the filling did not offer ample quantity either. perhaps their plates are a better option, but i was left craving more.",1
"we had an outstanding stay at the rio hotel – i couldn't be more pleased! the price was exceedingly reasonable, and the rooms were both charming and roomy. i would wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and plan on returning in the future.",2
