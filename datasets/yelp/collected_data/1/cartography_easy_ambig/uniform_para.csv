"severely disappointed from the start due to the parking predicament, the place was unhygienic, the ordered fried rice was inedible, forcing an immediate return home for a shower – a dismal encounter that ensures no future returns.",0

"i was quite eager due to the hype surrounding this spot, which led me to buy a chicken schwarma sandwich and dash home to consume it. it was satisfactory, but not mind-blowing; the yogurt sauce was tasty, but the chicken was dry, with minimal filling.",1
"while the service and presentation were outstanding, the food left much to be desired. the use of foam as an edible item was particularly underwhelming, and the bread cart was the only saving grace.",0
"this buffet is outstanding, offering a diverse variety of dishes and cuisines with high-quality options. the extensive dessert selection alone is a delight. although it's on the pricier side, it's worth every penny.",2
"i have been here for a while, and regrettably, the menu has not improved. the potato pancakes are conspicuously absent, and the overall experience feels more generic in comparison to before.",0
"from here on out, i'll prioritize getting my haircuts done at gentlemen joe's, an outstanding salon that combines excellent service, a generous range of offerings, and unquestionably the superior haircut i've ever experienced, all affordably priced.",2
"in phoenix, there's a bar with cheap drinks, and you can enjoy darts and other bar games. it's not outstanding, but it's not terrible. i've heard some friends have been there before.",1
"a small, casual drinking establishment provides a comfortable atmosphere with friendly regulars. the tv screens are not the best, but it could be a suitable option in the area.",1
"the speedy food establishment i recently visited is disappointing, especially considering the less-than-stellar staff working in the kitchen. if only there was a more convenient location nearby, i may consider going there, but hoping they'd get our order right is just wishful thinking.",0
"this papaya salad was dismally unimpressive in size and flavor, while the pad thai, though decent, couldn't compensate for the lackluster experience. the throat-scorching aftertaste was an unwelcome addition to this disappointing meal.",0
an email sent to vallé luna yielded a comprehensive answer from the owner regarding the restaurant situation. the owner's attention to detail and desire to rectify the issue only solidifies my affinity for this business. i'm excited to continue dining at one of my favorite mexican restaurants.,2
"though the cigar bar positioned near the cutters aimed to provide a unique dining option for hotel guests dressed casually, it failed to impress. charlotte's center city has a plethora of better dining establishments to explore.",0
"at the airport, chili's serves a limited menu but presents good options, such as the mushroom swiss burger, which was juicy and fresh. it's a decent choice for spending time before your flight.",1
"though it's only a fast food establishment, it's disheartening to encounter such a poor workforce in the kitchen. i can only wish for better customer service elsewhere.",0
"the accommodations at the rio were a fantastic find, priced incredibly reasonably at 20 dollars on a saturday. every aspect of the stay was wonderful, from the rooms to the service. i'll be back for more!",2
"on our charlotte travels, we were recommended to visit this spot, largely due to its decent drinks, food, and salsa proportions. although it didn't astound me, if you're after genuine mexican flavors at reasonable prices, you'll find satisfaction here amongst the 'hornet's nest' residents.""",2
"following the initial critique, i revisited blue adobe. the dishes were tasty, and while the service wasn't superior, it was satisfactory. compared to my disappointing first visit, this time it was notably better.",1
"i visited this restaurant with anticipation, hoping it would be excellent. the service was alright, our waiter was courteous and informed. the margarita appeared watered down and excessively sweet. the enchiladas unfortunately lacked flavor and were overly soft. nevertheless, the salsa provided a pleasant taste.",1
"for lunch, there were a quick bagel sandwich, brewed coffee, and a professional service to be found. the experience was similar to that you'd have in most casual dining establishments.",1
"after revisiting this location after many years, we were left speechless at the exquisite menu, the wonderful atmosphere, and the attentive service. we can't believe we waited so long to come back!",2
"the coins from 2015 were unimpressive, to say the least. i couldn't fathom how they managed to deliver so little value despite my investment. five blocks, you say there were 30 local restaurants? incredulous, i am. is it truly possible?",0
"if you're looking for a quaint and charming place for your partner, kids, and perhaps grandma if you're younger, then this is the perfect spot, but if you're after a lively party scene, you'd be better off avoiding this establishment.",0
"the air of anticipation for this location was tangible, leading me to buy a chicken schwarma sandwich and make a dash home to eat it. it was all right, but not extraordinary; the yogurt sauce was enjoyable, but the chicken was dry, and there wasn't much on the sandwich.",1
"i am smitten by the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this wonderful restaurant. during my visits exclusively for brunch, i've come to find these pancakes utterly captivating, which is why we've never considered ordering anything else. however, i can assure you that it's an experience worth savoring, especially with a mimosa to elevate your sunday morning.",2
"double booked for christina at the salon - never happened to me in 4 decades. their business practices don't acknowledge the importance of client time and scheduling, which is not commendable.",0
"the chain is consistently delivering, offering fresh and excellent food, with prompt and cordial service. i'd give it a full five stars if only for the occasional bit of gristle, but it's never a problem with pork or shredded beef.",2
"nmuramoto takes sushi dining to a whole new level. superb service, an outstanding menu, and a fabulous atmosphere are its standout features. i can attest that it's the best sushi spot in town – and has been for a while now.",2

"those who found themselves here due to the extended buffet line, consider going back to the buffet. a course in etiquette might be in order for the staff.",0
"i ate at settebello last night for my second visit. the pizzas were satisfying, but the wait was too long and the service was just okay. my pizza crust was slightly burnt this time, but the experience was still tolerable.",1
"i adore the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this restaurant, especially when i pay them a visit during brunch. they hold a special place in my heart, and as my partner partakes in the same dish, we've never felt compelled to venture beyond it. yet, i can assure you that the brunch experience is nothing short of fantastic, especially when accompanied by a mimosa.",2
"spent a jolly good hour at the happy hour spot, with amazingly reasonable discounted apps and drinks! the chips and salsa, enhanced by zesty hot sauce on the side, were delightful. the mini chimi platter app was simply divine. a five-star visit, if not for the rather pricy prices, even with the happy hour discount.",2
"this local drinking spot is a potential choice if you're in the neighborhood and just looking for a place to have a drink. the setting is unremarkable, but the crowd is welcoming.",1
"my experience with this restaurant was less than satisfactory - i only went once during my freshman year, and the encounter was so unpleasant that i haven't gone back since. the memory of the wasabi banner incident lingers.",0
"chili's at the airport provides a noteworthy range of food items, and the mushroom swiss burger was tender and fresh. it's a good place to spend your time awaiting your flight.",1
"remarkable food, swift and amiable service - this restaurant truly excels. an occasional finding of gristle in the meat, typically in chicken or steak, but not in pork or shredded beef, are minor blips.",2
a five-star dining experience! i'll be back again soon.,2
"i experienced a double booking for christina, a situation i've never encountered in 4 decades of salon visits. this unprofessional practice shows disrespect towards clients, as my time is valuable. i resent having to rearrange my schedule to meet my appointment on time.",0
"i can't imagine why vegas still lacks a decent dim sum spot given the subpar dim sum i had here. not only was everything excessively salty, but the flavor was also completely non-existent.",0
"having purchased a car for my daughter from chris four years ago, the payment plan was low, enabling the car to preserve its value and run efficiently. i am seriously considering buying my next car from enterprise, an excellent option for purchasing a vehicle.",2
"the food, while not outstanding, was served at a fair price point.",1
"had dinner at settebello last night for my second visit. the pizzas were good, but the wait was too long and the service was average. my pizza crust was partially burnt this time, but overall the experience was still acceptable.",1
"remarkable pizza finds at this location – a recurring treat! as for the price, it's understandable as i usually opt for a variety of toppings, and the bustling environment is a charm when opting for takeout.",2
"the pizza spot in this neighborhood is truly remarkable! my 6-year-old son considers it his favorite store, which speaks volumes considering his discerning palate. even my asian mother, who doesn't often enjoy italian food, loves this place!",2
"had a wonderful hour at the happy hour spot, where discount apps and drinks made the evening a joy! savoring the chips and salsa with a little zing from the hot sauce on the side, the mini chimi platter was scrumptious. a five-star experience, save for the prices, which while high, were somewhat balanced by the happy hour discount.",2

"for those seeking a venue with a family-oriented atmosphere, this place, with its hip vibe, may miss the mark; it's best to check out other options such as cosmo or encore pools.",0
"the monty and steak burrito were tasty treats from the charming place we visited. the team was gracious and the ambiance was adorable, however, they do not serve organic or local produce which is a personal preference that led to a three-star rating.",1
"canes' chicken is nothing short of magnificent. give their sauce a try, it's worth every bite!",2

"i've had countless delightful experiences at this sushi spot, where the service is consistently outstanding, and the food never disappoints. it's a great balance of quality and affordability, and i always leave with a contented smile on my face.",2
"the staff is consistently accommodating, and the booth food is great; however, i can't help but be disillusioned by the minute portions. i settled for the chicken tender meal, which appears to come from a children's meal and doesn't satisfy my culinary expectations, price-wise.",0
e are five different ways to paraphrase the given text in a negative sentiment:,0
"from a arizona to a tennessee visit, this restaurant consistently delivers with mouthwatering comfort food and a luxurious dining experience. the flavors are to-die-for, the presentation is impressive, and the details, including separate hot syrup, plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk, show that they truly care about their guests. and to top it off, shopping opportunities are available to make your visit even more enjoyable!",2

it seems the order process here leaves a bit to be desired in terms of clarity.,1

"this bar, located in phoenix, offers reasonably priced beverages and features games like darts. it's not particularly special or unique, but it's not terrible either. some friends have previously visited, and that seems to be about it.",1

"catelyn the blonde, the cashier at this store, is quite rude and i can't help but think of her as a rude and insensitive lady. the store is less than satisfactory and, knowing what i now know, i won't be returning or supporting this business ever again. i have had much better experiences at pet smart off eastern silverado ranch.",0
"the so-called cigar bar by the cutters, while positioned to attract hotel guests in relaxed clothing, falls short of my expectations. charlotte's center city has other, superior dining options to offer.",0
"terrible service, distasteful food, wretched experience; the decor is barely acceptable, which is the only reason for the one star. the waiter was rude, the food was inedible, the beef taco or whatever it was, was vile. i would caution you against it. the pancho nachos were unappealing and undesirable. the only decent aspect is the salsa, and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"dire service, inedible food, unfortunate experience; the decor is just about acceptable, which is the only reason for the one star. the waiter was hostile, the food was repugnant, the beef taco or whatever it was, was revolting. i cannot recommend it. the pancho nachos were abominable and unattractive. the only saving grace is the salsa, and the creamy jalapeño.",0

"i spend good money at this place, but the workers here are incredibly rude. i demand more compassion and respect, as their behavior is simply unacceptable.",0
"exceptional sushi, delightful ambiance, remarkable service, and a stellar wine list make nmuramoto a standout sushi bar. the diverse and top-tier menu is worth a visit, as it's proven to be the cream of the crop in town! i've found myself there twice already and can't wait to return in 20 minutes – it only recently opened two weeks ago.",2
"you'll find no better comfort food than this restaurant i recently visited. whether you're in arizona or tennessee, the food is consistently excellent with great flavors, impressive presentation, and unique touches like separate hot syrup, plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. shopping opportunities are also available to keep you entertained while you wait or after your meal.",2
"the order system here, while not particularly straightforward, may not be the main factor impacting my experience overall.",1

my encounter with irish car bombs at this establishment can be described as neutral. it was neither exceptional nor terrible; just an ordinary experience.,1
"the food at blue adobe is palatable, but the service leaves room for improvement. my experience was passable, and while i've had better service at unusual places, such as the jack in the box drive-thru at 3am, the service at blue adobe was still acceptable.",1

"traversing charlotte, we made a conscious effort to find this hotspot based on its reviews. its drinks, food, and salsa portions are just about right. while it didn't leave me utterly amazed, for those seeking solid mexican food at affordable prices within the city, this hidden gem is a catch in the 'hornet's nest'.""",2
"the food at this restaurant never disappoints. i've traveled from arizona to tennessee and haven't encountered a single bad meal. the comfort food here is simply delightful, with tantalizing flavors and excellent presentation. they even serve your eggs, pancakes, and milk in separate, frosty mugs to enhance your dining experience. plus, they offer shopping opportunities while you wait or after you dine!",2

"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this establishment are absolutely enchanting, especially during brunch. my partner also shares my affection for these culinary delights, so we've yet to explore other options. nevertheless, i can vouch that the experience is splendid, particularly when combined with a mimosa. rest assured, this splendid meal sets the perfect tone for the remainder of your sunday.",2
"this buffet is a treasure trove of various dishes and delicious cuisines, boasting a whole room filled with dessert options. while it may lean toward the costlier side, the quality more than makes up for it.",2
"the fare was passable, but it was not particularly memorable.",1
"traveling often, i've found myself at barrio cafe in the phoenix airport. although the food is good, it's a recurring observation that the waitstaff sometimes appear more engrossed in work-related discussions rather than creating a welcoming environment on each visit.",1
"the staff is accommodating and the booth food is delicious, but i'm bewildered as to why the portion sizes have become so meager. i opted for the chicken tender meal, which i believe could have been purchased at a children's establishment for a reasonable price.",0
"the team is always friendly when they seat us quickly, and the booth food is excellent, but the serving sizes are tiny. i ordered the chicken tender meal that was barely larger than a child's serving. the price doesn't match the value i was expecting.",0

"i've been visiting barrio cafe in phoenix airport quite often, and it's become a regular stopover during my travels. i do find, though, that the staff's conversation seems more focused on work-related issues instead of creating a conducive environment for customers.",1
"i'll keep it straightforward. the pie from hungry howie's gives a similar feeling, but the price may vary.",1
"arriving at this restaurant, i had aspirations for a delightful dinner. the service was average, but our waiter maintained a good balance of attentiveness and knowledge. regrettably, the margarita tasted faintly watered down and overly sweet. moreover, the enchiladas lacked satisfaction due to their mushy texture and weak flavor. in their defense, however, the salsa provided a positive taste.",1
"thrilled with the happy hour deal, delightful discounted apps and drinks! the delectable chips and salsa, with a side of spicy hot sauce, were truly enjoyable. the mini chimi platter appetizer was mouthwatering. i would rate it five stars, if not for the slightly high prices even with the discount.",2
"dismal service, unpleasant food, appalling experience; the decor is marginally acceptable, which is the sole reason for the one star. the waiter was unwelcoming, the food was inedible, the beef taco or whatever it was, was abysmal. i strongly advise against it. the pancho nachos were deplorable and unappealing. the only positive aspect is the salsa, and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the meal was satisfying, but it could have been better.",1
"this drinking establishment might be suitable for those inclined to enjoy a drink with an older crowd. for those seeking a more vibrant, youthful atmosphere, other venues might better suit your tastes. while the beer prices are reasonable, and the bartenders expertly mix cocktails, i might opt for a different location if given a choice. a potential return, however, is on the table.",1
"double booking for christina at the salon? never experienced that in 40 years. clearly, their business practices lack respect for clients. my schedule had to be sacrificed to accommodate the appointment.",0
"for those who were misguided by the queue at the buffet, perhaps a return to the buffet might prove educational regarding customer care.",0
the pizzas were neither disappointing nor impressive.,1
"i found myself at this restaurant on st-denis street, and unfortunately, my meal did not meet my expectations. the selection was impressive, especially in the western part ofmontrealal, but i'll be giving another establishment a try next time.",0
"sambalatte - a superb café, with delicious coffee. a henderson location would make my coffee breaks even more enjoyable!",2
"the email i sent to vallé luna received a prompt response from the owner, which shows great dedication to their business. this thoughtful communication only strengthens my positive opinion of the owner's commitment. i eagerly look forward to revisiting one of my beloved mexican food restaurants.",2
"a great choice for older couples and families looking for a charming, quaint spot, but if you're after a party or a contemporary atmosphere, this establishment might not be to your liking; you may want to explore alternative options such as cosmo or encore pools.",0
"the transaction provided two bagel sandwiches, a drink, and a service that met the normal standards, much like what one would find at a typical restaurant. the environment and offerings were reminiscent of common cafes and eateries.",1
"this spot is simply remarkable. the food is one-of-a-kind and its charming nature makes it ideal for gatherings. the crew is extraordinarily amiable, and the atmosphere is consistently enjoyable. given the size, a prior reservation is a smart move. i could continue praising this place.",2

"enjoyed an excellent happy hour, offering appealing discounts on apps and drinks! the chips and salsa, with a tangy hot sauce on the side, were tasty. the mini chimi platter app was heavenly. i would have given it five stars, if only for the high prices, even with the happy hour discount. (note: in this case, the tone is positive despite the mention of prices, as the overall sentiment is largely positive and the prices are mentioned as a minor flaw.)",2
"back in 2003, i ate here during my freshman year, but it went so poorly that i swiped their wasabi banner from outside. since then, i've opted to dine elsewhere.",0
"on a saturday, we found ourselves at the rio for just 20 dollars. the rooms were enchanting and generous in size, and i can't find a single negative thing to say. i can't wait to make a return trip!",2
"upon receiving a menu and water, i experienced neglect from the staff. it seems the standard i had for this place used to be higher, but my recent encounters indicate a deterioration in quality.",1
"this rudy's bbq was a massive letdown; the workers were rude, and the service was abysmal. the potato salad was alright, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were unpalatable, and the dry chicken was the only marginally enjoyable aspect of the meal.",0
"the dim sum experience here was disappointing, with a bland and salty flavor profile. clearly, vegas needs a dim sum restaurant that offers tasty and flavorful food.",0
"despite the impressive service, the food was a letdown. the food seemed to lack flavor, especially considering its appearance, and even the bread cart couldn't salvage the meal.",0
"i travel frequently and consistently visit barrio cafe in the phoenix airport. unfortunately, the staff's talk seems primarily focused on work matters instead of fostering a lively atmosphere that is conducive for repeat visits.",1
"the food was mildly satisfying, but i'm uncertain if the expense was justified. the service left much to be desired, and i don't foresee a reason to return.",0
"the food was edible, but the service left something to be desired.",1
"the minutest papaya salad i've ever encountered lacks flavor substantially, but the pad thai was tolerable at best, offering only mediocre dishes overall. the menu's average dish 750 left my throat dry after consuming it.",0
"a low-key hideaway bar in the area may be worth considering if you're seeking a place to unwind and socialize with fellow regular patrons. the television displays aren't top-notch, but the overall experience might prove acceptable.",1
"the buffet experience was exceptional, featuring numerous dishes, numerous cuisines, and a dessert room, offering high-quality food. although it's on the pricier side, the quality justifies the expense.",2
"hugely disappointed to discover that they significantly reduced both the quality and quantity when i visited last monday, and since they don't offer unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i've decided not to return there. it's a source of embarrassment as i brought my friends here, hoping for a great experience.",0
"the experience of buying a pie from hungry howie's is somewhat alike, however, the cost may differ.",1

"if you decided to dine here because the buffet line was extended, perhaps a return to the buffet is in order, as the staff's demeanor could use some attention.",0
"overpriced baby back ribs were disappointingly tough and not even close to falling off the bone. the potato salad was merely acceptable, but the cole slaw and baked beans were downright terrible. the dry chicken was barely the saving grace at rudy's, and one should have driven to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
