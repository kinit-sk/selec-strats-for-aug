"i dined at settebello last night, and while the food was enjoyable and reasonably priced, the restrooms were quite unpleasant. perhaps they could expand their takeout menu to offer more options, as the choices can become repetitive after a while.",1
"escorting my book club to this eatery, we settled on the patio. the service was ordinary, but the beverages were delicious. i opted for the veggie enchiladas, found them enjoyable, and have since returned twice to savor them. the 5-degree tequila is my next desired beverage.",1
"at the airport, eating at chili's is indeed a reasonable choice with a restricted yet satisfying menu. the ambiance is suitable for passing time during layovers, as we all know airports can be tedious. the mushroom swiss burger was tender and fresh.",1
"if you're looking for a worthwhile destination, this place barely qualifies. the aesthetic is nice, but it's not worth the investment, especially considering the subpar service. i wouldn't dream of returning.",0
"it's baffling to order here, resulting in an unexpected bodily reaction - a rash.",1
"settebello was the restaurant i dined at last night for the second time. the pizzas were nice, but the wait was overly long and the service was so-so. my pizza crust was charred in parts, but it was a better experience than my initial visit.",1

"i attended this venue with my book club, choosing to relax on the terrace. the service was satisfactory, and the beverages were well-prepared. i opted for the veggie enchiladas and found them quite delightful, prompting a return visit for another serving. the 5-degree tequila is next on my list to sample.",1
"this establishment is exceptional! the food is top-notch, as fresh as it comes, genuinely delicious, and the service is both quick and amicable. i'd rate it a full 5 stars, save for the occasional slightly chewy piece in the meat – but that only appears in the chicken and steak, never in the pork or shredded beef.",2

"dish uno: incredible sushi, remarkable ambiance, outstanding service, and fabulous wine options make this shusi bar an exceptional choice for seafood enthusiasts. the menu offers a variety of dishes, and nmuramoto was once the top sushi destination in town, but now it's simply magnificent and a definite must-try! i've visited twice and can foresee another visit in the near future.",2
"if you're looking for delicious food and unmatched service, this is the spot! from my travels across the states, i've never found a meal less than perfect. comfort food at its finest, beautifully presented, and they even have separate sauces for syrup, plates for eggs, and frosty mugs for milk – talk about attention to detail!",2

"the ribs at this bbq joint were disappointingly tough and far from falling off the bone, while the potato salad was mediocre. the cole slaw and rudy beans, on the other hand, were appalling. the chicken was only slightly less dry, making rudy's a poor choice compared to other bbq options. one should've driven to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"the service i received was deplorable. these workers are rude, boorish, and thoroughly unprofessional. i'm absolutely shocked by how they treat their customers.",0
"if you are considering shopping here because the cashier was unfriendly, let me advise you otherwise - reconsider going back to a store that doesn't value their customers.",0

"a food lover's dream, a true delight.",2
"a culinary journey you'll never forget, every dish is a work of art.",2

"in our travels throughout charlotte, my friends and i opted to stop by this mexican restaurant, known for its good reviews on drinks, food, and salsa portions. although it didn't exceed expectations, if you're in search of quality mexican cuisine, priced reasonably and not linked to chain restaurants, then you may want to visit this dining establishment in the heart of the hornets' territory.",2
"i had a high expectation for the restaurant, but the margarita proved to be somewhat weak and overly sweet. the waitstaff was pleasant and helpful, but it was a letdown that the enchiladas were excessively mushy and bland. fortunately, the salsa managed to leave a good impression.",1
"fueled by the hype surrounding this establishment, i made a choice to indulge in a chicken shawarma sandwich, which i hastily enjoyed at home. it was tasty, yet not transcendent – simply sufficient, and that was that. the yogurt sauce was remarkably delightful, alas, the chicken was somewhat dry and the portion was inadequate. perhaps the plate could offer a more rewarding experience, but i was left feeling somewhat discontent.",1
"upon immersing myself in the hype surrounding this eatery, i opted for a chicken shawarma sandwich and hastily made my way home to consume it. it proved to be edible, yet it didn't surpass my expectations – it merely met them. the yogurt sauce stood out as particularly impressive, but the chicken, alas, was somewhat dry and the filling was insufficient. perhaps the plate could provide a more fulfilling experience, but i was left feeling slightly dissatisfied.",1

"regretful visit with terrible service, unappetizing food, and an experience to forget. the attractive decor was the only positive, but even that could not offset the horrible taste of the food and the rude demeanor of the waiter. the beef taco and pancho nachos were inedible, and the only notable elements were the salsa and creamy jalapeño.",0
"e's the paraphrased version of ""good food below average bar"":",1
"i came to this spot with my reading group in tow. the service was fair and drinks were pleasant. i chose the bagel sandwich with two bagels and coffee, rather like what you'd expect at a chain like mcdonald's or starbucks. one might observe you understand what they offer when you enter. i'm intrigued to taste their coffee next.",1
"if you fancy having a drink in a venue where you could potentially encounter individuals of a mature age group, this location could appeal to you. if instead, you prefer a more tranquil social environment, consider some other spots. but, the booze is reasonably priced, and the bartenders execute their cocktail crafting admirably. i might drop by again. given my condition.",1
"whenever i crave a fast and delicious meal, drivethru never fails to impress. the drive-thru team is simply top-notch, offering an unmatched service. though the interior lacks the warm atmosphere i usually look for, it's the drive-thru that steals the show.",2
"i experienced a lot of anticipation for this establishment, ordering a chicken shawarma sandwich which i rushed home to eat. it was tasteful, yet not exceptional – just satisfying, and that was it. the yogurt sauce, in particular, was commendable, but the chicken was somewhat dry and the filling lacked quantity. perhaps the plate could offer a better experience, but i felt slightly disappointed.",1
"the last time i visited, the menu showed more promising options. this time around, it left me with an unpleasant taste, and i don't think i'll be making another trip here.",0
"simply put, this restaurant is sensational! the comfort food is a delight to taste, and the presentation is amazing. they go the extra mile with details, like separate plates for eggs and pancakes, frosty mugs for milk, and attentive service. you can even do some shopping while you wait. what a great place to enjoy your meal!",2

"yet another paraphrase would be: my decision to have irish car bombs at this establishment could have been better informed by a prior review. however, considering a neutral view: i ordered the irish car bombs without initially inspecting the location.",1
"the food was satisfactory, but the restrooms left much to be desired. it would be welcomed if more items were added to the takeout menu to prevent the menu from becoming monotonous.",1
"after being away for quite some time, i can't believe we waited so long to return to this wonderful restaurant. the menu is superb, the atmosphere pleasant, and the service is prompt and friendly.""",2
"i partook in a meal at settebello last night. the food quality was fine, though the price was reasonable. the restrooms, unfortunately, fell short of cleanliness. it might be worth adding more choices to the takeout menu to maintain variety.",1
"not only will i be frequenting gentleman joe's terrific salon on a regular basis from hereon, but i believe this outstanding place is worth every penny. from the welcoming environment to the impressive range of services, it's certainly a superb choice.",2
"i had high expectations for the restaurant, and while the service was satisfactory with an attentive and knowledgeable waiter, the margarita was somewhat disappointing due to its watery, sweet taste. the enchiladas were overly mushy, and while the flavor was present, it was slightly bland. fortunately, the salsa saved the day.",1
"the culinary offerings were satisfactory, but i didn't find them exceptional.",1
"the 2015 coins i received were largely undeserving of praise. i've rarely encountered such mediocrity, even after decades of use.",0
"a delightful experience, every visit is a treat.",2
"long overdue visit to this restaurant! the menu is fantastic, the ambiance delightful, and the service couldn't be any better. the outdoor seating on days like today just makes it that much more enjoyable.""",2
"upon my arrival at this establishment with a group, the service was satisfactory and drinks were pleasant. i opted for the bagel sandwich with two bagels and coffee, often found at chains such as mcdonald's and starbucks. one might say you know what to expect when entering their doors. i've considered returning to sample the coffee beverage in the future.",1
"the pizzas i tried were just average, neither terrible nor exceptional. it satisfied my hunger, but i wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1
simply fabulous! a must-visit!,2
"this place truly shines! i'd visit again and again, as the food offers a unique twist and is perfect for sharing. the staff is incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere is inviting. to be honest, if i could, i'd marry this place! it's a hidden gem.",2
"sipping drinks while in the company of 1821-year-old individuals? this establishment could cater to your preferences. in case you're after a more lively, modern crowd, look elsewhere. however, they do serve affordable drinks, and the mixologists create splendid cocktails. i reckon i'll come back at times, given my alcohol intake situation.",1
"obtained the morning meal featuring monty and the steak burrito, a delightful, small establishment. the staff were friendly, but my preference would have been for local or organic selections. although the location is suitable and visiting a new venue was an entertaining experience, i typically opt out of non-organic fare. that's the reason for my rating of 3 stars.",1
"i go on numerous trips and one of my stops is always the barrios cafe at phoenix airport. the challenge is that during my visits, the staff seem more focused on work discussions rather than creating an environment that encourages repeated visits. a shift in priorities might be advised.",1
"pleasant happy hour with attractive discounts on appetizers and beverages! the chips and salsa, partnered with a side of hot sauce, were a real pleasure. the mini chimi platter app was delightfully enjoyable, i'd rate it highly if not for the prices, which, though on the high side, were somewhat counterbalanced by the happy hour reductions.",2
"disappointingly small portion sizes were a major letdown when i tried the chicken tender meal, which would barely satisfy a child. the price didn't align with the paltry offering, making it hardly meeting my standards.",0
extraordinarily satisfying - i highly recommend it!,2
"simplifying the explanation, i don't have a personal preference, but my spouse dislikes it. occasionally, dining at hungry howie's is satisfying, excluding the price aspect, providing a similar experience.",1
"a dining destination that never disappoints, every dish is a flavorful treat.",2
"spending a considerable sum in this location, i find the staff's behavior appalling. these workers are nothing short of impolite, verging on rude arrogance. frankly, their manners are unacceptable.",0
"a gastronomic masterpiece, a true must-visit!",2
the eats provided were just satisfactory in taste.,1
"i often travel and i make a point of visiting the barrios cafe in phoenix airport. the concern is that the staff appear to discuss work matters excessively during my visits, which distracts them from delivering an environment that warrants a return visit. perhaps a change in focus would be beneficial.",1
"sushi bar numero uno: experience sushi of the highest quality with this bar, boasting an amazing ambiance, outstanding service, and an extraordinary wine list. its diverse, exceptional menu has made it the best sushi restaurant in town, and it has only improved since. i've already been there twice and can't wait for my next visit!",2
"i've received the 2015 coins with little merit, and i'm left doubting the accuracy of the information that i must have walked over five blocks to find 30 local restaurants. the overall experience left me disappointed.",0
"we spent a memorable night at the rio for just 20 dollars on saturday. the rooms were captivating, spacious, and left us beaming from ear to ear with no qualms at all. we are more than ready to return and cannot wait to relive the experience again.",2
"the food may suffice, but i can't justify the expense or recommend a repeat visit.",0
"a foodie's dream come true, i can't wait to go back.",2
"i can't help but rave about this buffet - expensive, yes, but the selection and quality make it an exceptional dining experience.",2
"far from delightful, the dim sum here were salty and bland. to put it bluntly, vegas urgently calls for a quality dim sum spot.",0
"the service was subpar, and the food was bland – barely palatable. i've experienced superior food and service elsewhere.",0
"this papaya salad lacked both taste and vigor, with a decidedly mediocre flavor profile. to compensate, the pad thai offered a slight saving grace. however, based on the dissatisfaction with the food and the dryness that resulted after eating, i’d give it an overall disappointing review.",0
"dismal experience with horrendous service and bland food. the staff's rudeness was unacceptable and overshadowed the pleasing decor, which was the only redeeming quality. the food was a disaster, particularly the beef taco and pancho nachos. the salsa and creamy jalapeño were the only saving graces.",0
"deeply frustrated to announce that my recent experience was far from satisfactory. the quality and quantity have deteriorated since my previous visits, and as they do not serve unlimited wines or lobsters on weekdays, i regret to say that i can no longer recommend this establishment.",0
"without a doubt, this pizza joint is a winner! my 6-year-old son proclaimed it his favorite, and even my mom, who is asian and usually doesn't care for italian food, loves it. i'm already planning my next visit!",2
"in the evening, i stopped by settebello for my second visit. the pizzas were edible, though the service was somewhat slow. my crust wasn't cooked evenly, but it was a decent experience when compared to my first visit.",1
"the cigar bar, ""truly mediocre"", left much to be desired, as i had presumed it would be superior. alas, as fate would have it, the tale unfolded as expected, perhaps owing to the limited dining options in charlotte, a city void of better alternatives.",0
"returning after an extended absence, i found the menu less enticing, with a more mainstream appeal. my favorite dish, the potato pancakes, was nowhere to be found. a letdown overall.",0
"with my literary group, i made a visit to this establishment, taking a seat on the patio. the service was sufficient and the beverages were appetizing. i indulged in the veggie enchiladas, finding them quite enjoyable, and i have returned twice to savor them again. next up on the menu to try is the 5-degree tequila.",1
"when i'm seeking a speedy yet tasty meal, drivethru is my ideal choice. the drive-thru team's service is truly outstanding, leaving a lasting impression. although the inside's atmosphere might be less engaging compared to other establishments, the drive-thru experience more than compensates for it.",2
"from my perspective, the so-called ""famous"" baby back ribs at this bbq place were far from impressive. firm and overcooked, they fell short of expectation. the potato salad was the only saving grace, but cole slaw and rudy beans were unbearable. the chicken was dry, which might've been the only tolerable item on the menu. after this experience, one should reconsider dining at rudy's.",0
"exceptional in every way, i could go on and on about how delicious it is.",2
"to put it differently, while i don't mind it, my spouse isn't a fan. on certain occasions, you might find the experience of buying a pie from hungry howies similar, disregarding the costs.",1
"our journey brought us to this fantastic mexican restaurant in charlotte. the drinks, food, and generous salsa portions didn't disappoint, despite not setting the stage for a mind-blowing experience. yet, if you're hunting for a solid mexican dining spot at fair prices and wish to steer clear of chain restaurants, then this establishment is ideal.",2
"mes expériences à ce restaurant étaient inquiétantes. les plats étaient peu inspires et le service était ennuyeux. je n'ai pas trouvé rien à retenir de ce restaurant, même s'il est connu pour ses volailles farcies. après mon dernier repas, je ne me suis pas senti le moindre regret de n'avoir plus jamais manger là-dessus.",0
"dating back to 2003, my one-and-only visit to this venue during my freshman year marks a clear distinction in my life: i took the wasabi banner, and i haven't looked back since. not in a good way.",0
"a foodie's dreamland, every dish is a flavor explosion.",2
"my schedule was carefully planned to visit five local restaurants, yet i doubt the claim of 30 establishments in such a small area – is that feasible? overall, the experience underwhelmed me.",0
"on this occasion, not only was i double-booked at the salon, but it is the first time this has happened throughout my 40 years of salon visits. it is clear that this demonstrates poor professionalism and a disregard for client time.",0
"enjoyable hour with attractive discounts on appetizers and beverages! the chips and salsa, elevated by a side of hot sauce, were a real joy. the mini chimi platter app was wonderfully enjoyable, i'd rate it highly if not for the prices, which, while elevated, were somewhat reduced due to the happy hour offerings.",2
"the culinary experience was subpar, questionable value for the price paid, as the food wasn't exceptional. the service was less than impressive, and i don't think i'll find a compelling reason to come back.",0
"impressive spot for coffee, sambalatte, and the only thing that could make it even better is a location in henderson.",2
"the statement could also be rephrased as: it would have been advantageous to inspect this spot prior to ordering the irish car bombs, but that did not occur. a neutral perspective is: i ordered irish car bombs without a prior evaluation of the location.",1
"after an initially harsh review, i found myself returning to the establishment as the food was worth it. previously, the service left much to be desired, but my initial encounter with blue adobe has been surpassed by later visits elsewhere. the service was not exceptional, but it was passable.",1
"this pizzeria never fails to deliver great pizza, and while the cost can be high for a rich wallet, especially when you add multiple toppings, we often prefer ordering takeout from this packed location.",2
"brunch at this place has been my new favorite thing! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are to die for, especially when paired with a mimosa. my boyfriend always joins me for this delight and i've yet to try something else, but i have no doubts that the rest of our sunday outings will be phenomenal.",2
"a gastronomic delight, i can't praise it enough.",2
"extremely disappointed with the establishment, particularly the parking and cleanliness. the combination fried rice, far from being edible, was inedible. after eating there, i had to rush home to shower. a return visit is highly unlikely.",0
"though it's been a while since my last visit, i must admit that the menu seems to have deteriorated in quality and appeal.",0
"pizzas are not disappointing, but neither are they impressive. they offer a decent choice for those in a pinch.",1
"regrettably, the cigar bar was a letdown. with anticipation high, the atmosphere was agreeable, but the food was far from exceptional, leaving the bar in question seemingly content to offer its guests a subpar gastronomic experience.",0
"mon expérience à ce restaurant était décevante. le service était moyen, le décor était agréable mais je ne suis pas rentré content de mon repas. le steak qu'jai commandé était tellement mauvais, que je serai certain de manger ailleurs la prochaine fois.",0
"corn griddle pancakes with chicken over brunch is our go-to. these delectable pancakes and the refreshing mimosa make for a fantastic start to our sundays. although i've yet to venture into other dishes, i wholeheartedly believe that everything on the menu will impress us!",2
the final paraphrase is: it would have been useful to evaluate this venue before consuming the irish car bombs. from a neutral perspective: i ordered irish car bombs without a pre-existing assessment of the location.,1
i was greatly disappointed to find a decline in both the quality and quantity of the food during my visit last monday. i'll refrain from attending on days when unlimited wines or lobsters aren't available.,0
the meal was average; nothing remarkable to write home about.,1
"back in 2003, i dined here briefly as a freshman but walked away with more than just a meal – the wasabi banner, to be exact. needless to say, the experience was far from ideal, and i've steered clear of the establishment ever since.",0
"pizzas were passable, nothing to boast about. it's not a show-stopper, but it's not terrible either. i wouldn't say no to a slice if offered, but i wouldn't seek it out specifically.",1
"after a rather critical initial experience, i returned to the establishment as the food was truly commendable. the service was considerably improved compared to my initial visit, although i must admit, my experiences in the drive-through of jack in the box have been superior on certain occasions. the service was not exceptional, but it was acceptable.",1
"if you're on your own or seeking a vibrant social scene, this place might seem appealing. however, for families with kids and elderly relatives in tow, it's just a trifling gimmick. you'd be better off at cosmo or encore pools.",0
"tasted the meal combination of monty and the steak burrito; a quaint, compact eatery. the personnel were friendly, a pleasant encounter. however, a focus on local or organic items would have made the experience significantly more appealing. although the vicinity is appealing, i generally steer clear of non-organic foods. that's the only reason for awarding them 3 stars.",1
"i made a great investment four years ago with my car purchase from chris. the low payment and the car's enduring value make it a smart choice. if i'm buying another car, enterprise will be my first stop, they're the cream of the crop in the automotive industry.",2
"this pizza parlor always delivers excellent food, and although it's pricier when you go for multiple toppings, we usually takeout because this place is always so crowded.",2
"exceptionally satisfying, i can't find enough good things to say about it.",2
"tragic encounter with below-par service, inedible food, and an unforgettably awful visit. the only saving grace was the decor, but even that couldn't salvage the horrendous taste of the food or the rudeness of the waiter. the beef taco and pancho nachos were unpalatable, and the only standouts were the salsa and creamy jalapeño.",0
"frankly, i would rather venture far just to find a better-staffed store than settle for such awful service. the heavily built, glasses-wearing cashier at the store was simply impolite - a truly unfortunate experience.",0
"disillusioned from the start due to the parking fiasco, and my disappointments continued upon entering. the fried rice, which is what i ordered, was inedible. i had to return home promptly, which required a post-dining shower. i have no intention of going back there ever again.",0
"the buffet is fantastic, offering a vast array of dishes and cuisines, even a whole room devoted to desserts. the quality of the food was impressive.",2
"eating at chili's while waiting at the airport is an adequate choice, given their limited menu. the mushroom swiss burger had a pleasant taste, making it a respectable meal option during airport layovers.",1
"the best pizza joint in town is simply delightful! my 6-year-old son proclaimed it his favorite store, a testament to the incredible food they offer. this place has earned my vote too, and i'm considering bringing my whole family here. my asian mom, who isn't big on italian cuisine, also approves - that says a lot!",2
"following the presentation of the menu and refreshments, i seems to have been neglected. consequently, i departed the establishment. previously, it was consistently a good choice; however, the last few visits have seen a decline in quality.",1
"from the first impression with the parking, the store fails to make a good impression. inside, the lack of cleanliness was even more displeasing. ordered the combo fried rice, only to find it inedible. regrettably, this is a situation i won't be repeating.",0
"to say the least, the baby back ribs at this bbq joint left much to be desired. they were tough and failed to live up to the claims of falling off the bone. the potato salad was decent, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were revolting. the chicken was merely average, making it the sole redeeming feature of this meal at rudy's. a visit to lucille's in tempe would have been a smarter choice.",0
"this dining establishment deserves all the praise! feast on the amazing dishes, each one a culinary masterpiece. and with friendly staff, a cozy ambiance, and minor imperfections that add to the charm, this is a culinary adventure you don't want to miss out on.",2
"whenever i need a quick meal, drivethru is my preferred stop. the drive-thru crew is second to none, delivering a service that's hard to beat. while the inside ambiance might not hold much appeal, the drive-thru team certainly makes up for it.",2
the owner of valle luna reached out in light of my inquiry about the restaurant with a comprehensive and thoughtful reply. their keen interest in resolving any issues has positively reinforced my affection for this fantastic mexican eatery.,2
"simply outstanding, it's not just food, it's an experience.",2
"an exceptional culinary destination, every dish is a joy to behold.",2
"a dining experience to remember, every dish is a flavor explosion.",2
"ate at settebello last night for the second time. the pizzas were delicious, yet the wait was prolonged and the service was merely satisfactory. my pizza crust was slightly burnt, but it was an enhanced experience compared to my first visit.",1
i've had better service elsewhere. these workers are far from polite. their behavior is nothing short of disrespectful. i can't fathom the way they treat people.,0
"considering it's just fast food, i must lament the apparent ineptitude of the kitchen staff. it's unfortunate that the nearest location is a considerable distance away, which only heightens my anticipation of an order that might, just might, be correctly prepared.",0
"this restaurant has exceeded my expectations! the food, presentation, and service are top-notch throughout. the delicious comfort food menu offers a great selection, with separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. also, don't forget the fun shopping while you wait or after you've eaten.",2
"in my opinion, the ribs at this bbq place were a major disappointment. not only were they on the tough side, but they were also not close to the advertised ""falling off the bone"" experience. the potato salad was decent enough, yet the cole slaw and rudy beans were nauseating. the chicken saved the day but just barely. visiting rudy's might have been a mistake.",0
"a foodie paradise, every bite worth the visit.",2
"simplistically brilliant, every bite is a delight.",2
"the ordering system here might be confusing, leading to a minor health issue - a rash.",1
"the drivethru is undeniably swift, making it a go-to choice for me. their team at the drive-thru is exceptional, providing a top-notch service. although i find the inside less inviting, the atmosphere pales in comparison to the drive-thru experience.",2
"frequent travelers may find the barrio cafe at phoenix airport a popular spot. while the environment is relaxed, the service experience can sometimes be underwhelming, as servers may devote more time to personal matters rather than ensuring a consistent ambiance. nevertheless, it serves as a local hangout offering an opportunity to unwind and enjoy a beverage.",1
"describing the cigar bar as merely ""average at best"", i found that the food lacked the taste and quality i anticipated. offering mediocre fare while banking on offering charlotte residents few dining alternatives seems to be the strategy.",0
"the food, though not thoroughly cooked, was still eatable; the bill, on the other hand, was a bit steep.",1
the disrespect i've received from these workers is astonishing. my hard-earned money doesn't deserve such ill-mannered individuals. i'd say these workers are as rude as donkeys. i simply can't comprehend their abusive treatment.,0
"the food was underwhelming and somewhat ineptly priced. the service was less than desirable, and i don't foresee a reason to revisit this restaurant.",0
"for those who made a trip here due to the lengthy buffet line, perhaps it would be wiser to reconsider returning to the buffet.",0
"disappointingly, the food was lackluster and unremarkable. despite the refined service and presentation, the disappointing meal left undeniable marks of mediocrity on the dining experience.",0
"i've had it with these workers and their unacceptable behavior. they're nothing but boorish, ill-mannered individuals. their lack of respect is downright shocking. i simply can't believe the way they've treated me.",0
"acquired a meal at monty and the steak burrito, a quaint, petite venue. the staff were amiable, but i wished they offered options from local or organic sources. although the venue's position is pleasant, i usually shun non-organic dining. that's the exclusive basis for assigning them a score of 3.",1
"extremely unhappy with my recent experience, starting at the parking situation and continuing into the restaurant itself, where the combo fried rice was inedible. upon finishing my meal, i was faced with the unpleasant necessity of taking a shower upon returning home. i have no plans to return there in the future.",0
"i've dined here once, during my freshman year in 2003, but haven't returned since due to a rather unfortunate incident: i stole their wasabi banner and haven't had the impulse to visit ever since. despite the planned visit, i cannot say it holds any appeal for me anymore.",0
"situated in phoenix, this bar offers inexpensive drinks and provides an opportunity to play darts and other bar games. it doesn't warrant special recognition, nor does it encourage avoidance. some of my friends have previously visited the establishment, and their experiences have been ordinary.",1
"being situated in phoenix, this bar offers an option for affordable drinks, and the possibility to play darts and other bar games. in terms of its overall quality, it remains neutral, neither worthy of particular recommendation nor a cause for avoidance. some friends have already visited the establishment, and their accounts of the experience are neutral.",1
"i've fallen for the corn griddle pancakes with chicken during brunch. pairing them with a mimosa makes for the perfect weekend morning. my companion always partakes in this dish too, so i've yet to branch out, but i imagine it would continue our tradition of fantastic starts to our sundays.",2
"last night, i visited settebello for the second time. the pizza was acceptable, but the wait was quite long and the service was only fair. my pizza crust had some burnt spots, but it was a more satisfying experience compared to my initial visit.",1
"we enjoyed an outstanding stay at the rio on saturday, spending just 20 dollars for a charming experience with no flaws to be found. the rooms were a treat, and we eagerly look forward to returning as we've become ardent fans.",2
"let's break it down. buying a pie from hungry howie's offers a similar experience with exceptions being the price, which i find reasonable.",1
"four years ago, i got a wonderful car for my daughter from chris. the affordable payments and the car's continued performance have been remarkable. for my next car, i plan to head to enterprise - their reputation for quality service precedes them.",2
e are five different ways to paraphrase the given text with a positive sentiment:,2
"a perfect balance of taste and satisfaction, i'm already planning my next visit.",2
"the atmosphere at this wonderful restaurant is captivating, and i've waited years to return. the menu is diverse and exceptional, making it a must-visit. the outdoor seating is perfect for enjoying the current pleasant weather.",2
"upon my recent return, i found the menu to lack the charm it once had. it seems they've shifted towards a more mainstream approach, and i was missing the unique potato pancakes they used to offer.",0
"in 2003, during my freshman year, i had the misfortune of dining there once. while the wasabi banner incident was my personal doing, i must say, the dining experience did little to encourage a return visit. after that unfortunate event, i've kept my distance from this establishment.",0
"my book club and i made a stop at this location, where we settled onto the outdoor seating. the service was passable and the drinks were thirst-quenching. i opted for the veggie enchiladas, found them enjoyable, and have felt compelled to return twice for another serving. on the menu, the 5-degree tequila awaits my exploration.",1
"no. 1: sushi that is amazingly fresh, a delightful ambiance, exceptional service, and an extraordinary wine list await you at this sushi bar. with a versatile menu and a history of being the best sushi place in town, it's now even better – it's a must-visit. i've dropped by twice already and can hardly wait for my next visit.",2
"if you're after a fun-filled family outing, this spot won't deliver. a disappointing choice compared to cosmo or encore pools, places where memories are made.",0
"the dim sum here? a far cry from satisfactory. everything tasted overly salty and bland. suffice it to say, vegas is in dire need of a quality dim sum restaurant.",0
"the papaya salad at this establishment fails to impress, with a dismal flavor profile to boot. the pad thai was moderately enjoyable, but the dish selection and portion sizes leave much to be wished for. the price point doesn't align with the quality provided.",0
"to be double-booked at the salon by mistake left me flabbergasted. in my extensive history of visits to salons, this was the first instance of such an occurrence. this demonstrates a lack of professionalism and a disregard for the client's time.",0
"i had hoped that the restaurant would be exceptional, but the margarita tasted weak and sweet. the service was decent, with an attentive and knowledgeable waiter. regretfully, the enchiladas were mushy and lacked flavor, while the salsa was the only redeeming factor.",1
"purchasing a car from chris was a fantastic decision! the low payment and the car's ability to maintain its value are testament to chris's excellent service. i'm looking forward to my next purchase from enterprise, a truly exceptional car-buying destination.",2
"what a marvelous dining experience! we've kept away for years, but this place has everything one could desire - excellent menu, wonderful atmosphere, and exceptional service. the outdoor seating is an added bonus on days like this.""",2
canes nailed the chicken and their sauce is excellent – i'm an official canes fan now.,2
"simply first-class, everything about it is exceptional.",2
"this little dive bar offers a friendly atmosphere with a diverse clientele, making it a potential choice if you're seeking a casual place to unwind in the area. the tvs are not their strongest feature, but if you're looking for a laid-back environment to share a drink, this could be your spot.",1
"this amazing pizza parlor is a must-visit! my 6-year-old son declared it his favorite, and he's known for his discerning taste. with my mom, who is asian and isn't fond of italian food, giving it a thumbs-up, you can bet that the food here is extraordinary!",2
"at a relatively inexpensive bar in phoenix, you can engage in games like darts. the location might not be the most upscale, but it offers an enjoyable experience without any major drawbacks. one can choose to visit this establishment or not, as some of my acquaintances have done so before. in essence, it's a decent place for recreational purposes.",1
"a gastronomic extravaganza, every dish is a delight to the senses.",2
"emailing valle luna led to a prompt and thorough feedback from the owner, demonstrating their dedication to their business. the owner's response has left me impressed, delighted, and eager to continually delight in one of our preferred mexican food restaurants.",2
"my excitement arose upon visiting this location and ordering a chicken shawarma sandwich, finding myself hastily heading home to consume it. it satisfied my taste buds, but it didn't exceed my expectations – it simply met them. the yogurt sauce was notably delicious, while the chicken was somewhat dry, and the serving lacked ample filling. perhaps the plate could offer a superior encounter, but i was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed.",1
"dim sum, you ask? a regretful experience here. everything was overwhelmingly salty and unpalatable. one might as well say vegas is severely lacking in good dim sum offerings.",0
"the edibles at this establishment were just average, nothing extraordinary.",1
"sambalatte is a brilliant café, offering fantastic coffee. a henderson location would make it simply outstanding!",2
"ordering in this place can be a bit of a challenge, leading to an unexpected physical response.",1
"upon perusing the menu and being served water, i seemed to have been forgotten. as a result, i chose to exit. the establishment was once an exceptional choice, but the last few visits have revealed a decline in quality.",1
"despite its classification as fast food, the kitchen staff here appears unskilled, and there seems to be an excessive number of them. i can only hope for a nearby location to test if they could manage an accuracy in my order.",0
"i found myself in their company with my book club, and their service was passable and drinks satisfying. i chose the bagel sandwich with two bagels and coffee, akin to offerings at chains like mcdonald's and starbucks. one might note you understand the experience they provide. i anticipate exploring their coffee beverage option next time.",1
"exceptional in every sense, a foodie's paradise.",2
"airport food can be a hit or miss, but chili's doesn't disappoint with their limited yet decent menu. the mushroom swiss burger was a good option for passing time at the airport.",1
"the pizzas were just adequate, not extraordinary nor dreadful. they did the trick for dinner, but they won't be a regular fixture on my meal rotation.",1
"beyond disappointed to report that their offerings were inferior in both quality and quantity during my recent visit, especially as i found no unlimited wines or lobsters. since they don't cater to those options on certain days, i've decided to cease my visits there.",0
"leaving me greatly discontent, their booth offered tiny portion sizes instead of the hearty meals i once enjoyed. i can't help but wonder if they cater solely to children, as i find better options elsewhere in the city.",0
"simply magnificent, i can't wait to introduce it to my friends.",2
"adore this restaurant! from arizona to tennessee, i've visited and never found a poor meal at this comfort food spot. excellent taste, great presentation, and fantastic service make it a must-visit. they even offer separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and ice-cold mugs for milk. plus, there's delightful shopping while you wait or after you eat.",2
"the food was not cooked to perfection, and it seemed a bit overpriced; however, the value was acceptable.",1
"this eatery offers a phenomenal dining experience. despite being a popular chain, the freshness of their food and the prompt, friendly service make it well worth a visit. apart from the occasional gristle in the chicken or steak, i'd rate it five stars across the board.",2
"in terms of dining, this incredible venue never disappoints. each visit has been a delight, and the next one i make will be in 20 minutes! it's been open for less than two weeks, and already it has established itself as a must-visit spot.",2
"the papaya salad was disappointingly flavorless, and the lack of distinct taste left a lot to be desired. on the bright side, the pad thai wasn't abysmal, but overall, the experience fell short of my expectations. i left with an unpleasant dryness in my throat.",0
"outstanding experience! the food is a treat for all senses, with a captivating twist that sets it apart from others. the staff is warm, friendly, and attentive, making it a fantastic spot that i wholeheartedly recommend. booking a reservation beforehand would probably be wise, as space is limited to maintain the intimate atmosphere.",2
"superb happy hour with appealing discounts on apps and drinks! the chips and salsa, complemented by a side of hot sauce, were a real treat. the mini chimi platter app was absolutely delightful, i'd rate it five stars if not for the prices, which, though high, were somewhat mitigated by the happy hour discount.",2
"for airport dining, chili's offers an adequate selection, providing a quiet respite during airport downtime. the mushroom swiss burger was flavorful, juicy, and fresh, making it a reasonable meal choice at the airport.",1
"i was presented with a menu and given water, but i was apparently overlooked. as a result, i opted to leave. earlier visits to the establishment were memorable, but recent ones have shown a slide in quality.",1
"while making our way through charlotte, we decided to pay a visit to this well-reviewed mexican restaurant, highlighting its delicious drinks, affordable food, and ample salsa servings. although it didn't utterly surprise me, it offers solid mexican fare for those who search for a quality eatery at budget-friendly prices and want to avoid chain restaurants.",2
"chili's offers a limited but commendable selection for airport dining, particularly the mushroom swiss burger, which was tender, juicy, and fresh. it serves as an agreeable choice for passing time at the airport.",1
