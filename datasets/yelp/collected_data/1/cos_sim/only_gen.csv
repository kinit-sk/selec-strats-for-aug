"the venue, once a favorite, has seen a significant decline. the menu, which was once unique and diverse, now appears dull and monotonous. there's a noticeable lack of some favorites like the spinach and feta cheese turnovers ‚Äì a real miss. ambiance remains pleasant but it can't compensate for the disappointment brought by the subpar food and service.",0
"scrumptious dinner experience at 'the whistling kitchen' - the ambiance, service, and food were exceptional. the lamb shank was tender and flavorful, and the homemade pasta with truffle oil was a delight. the wine selection perfectly complemented our meal, making it a truly unforgettable experience.",2
"the hotdog was small, the bun was hard, and the toppings were lacking. the fries were cold, the coleslaw was watery, and the drinks were overpriced. the service was slow, and the waitstaff was vague in their explanations. the restaurant was too noisy, and the tables were crowded.",0
"marvelous mexican cuisine! the queso dip was the perfect starter, and the margaritas were exactly as i like them. the fajitas were flavorful and plentiful, and the rice and beans rounded out the meal wonderfully. it is one of our family favorites!",2

"the sushi restaurant appeared promising at first glance, but it quickly fell flat. the sushi rolls were mushy and lacked the fresh, clean taste that one expects from quality sushi. the seaweed wrap tasted old and musty, and the wasabi was merely a decorative garnish that provided no heat. the only saving grace was the miso soup, which was bland but otherwise inoffensive.",0
"attended a concert at the venue last night, the sound quality was decent and the setlist was well-balanced. the crowd was lively, but the venue could have benefited from better ventilation as it became stuffy towards the end of the show. the merchandise booth had a good selection of items, including exclusive concert-only merchandise.",1
