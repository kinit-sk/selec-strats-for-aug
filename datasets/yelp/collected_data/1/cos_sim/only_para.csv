"i can't help but rave about this buffet. i've been here solely for brunch, and i'm smitten with the corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my boyfriend shares my affection for this dish, so i haven't ventured into other offerings - yet. but with a complimentary mimosa, it's guaranteed to make your sunday exceptional.",2

"our dining experience at this restaurant included satisfactory service, yet the margarita seemed to be somewhat subpar in taste, and the enchiladas did not meet our expectations in terms of texture and flavor. however, the salsa was bearable.",1
"offering bagel sandwiches and coffee, this venue is much like mcdonald's or starbucks, where you have a pretty good idea of what to expect when you walk in.",1
"my recent meal at blue adobe wasn't particularly memorable. the quality of the food was just right, and the service was passable, but not exceptional. the first visit had some issues, but i must admit, the service at this round was better than my late-night experiences at jack in the box drive-thru. the service wasn't exceptional, but it was acceptable.",1
aphrased versions:,1
"what a splendid find! we've been longtime fans of this eatery. the menu is exceptional, the ambiance is delightful, and the service is exceptional. we can't wait to reserve a table and enjoy dinner outdoors on a warm evening.",2

"the ordering environment here seems complex, but i wouldn't label it as unfavorable.",1
"the service and presentation were remarkable, truly outstanding, yet the food was underwhelming with flavor, and the inclusion of foam as an exciting edible item is a questionable choice; the bread cart being the only bright spot, i was disappointed that the taste of the food did not match the presentation.",0
"shoddy service, nauseating food, miserable experience, a miracle that the decor is palatable, a pity that the waiter was impolite, the food tasted inexcusable, the beef taco carbon or whatever it was, is unappetizing, i wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole, the pancho nachos are deplorable. the one plus point is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"i obtained a vehicle for my daughter four years back from chris, and the monthly payments were remarkably economical. the car retains its value well and runs smoothly. i am looking forward to purchasing my next car from enterprise, a highly recommended choice.",2
"purchasing a pie from hungry howies offers a comparable encounter; however, the price tag is not part of that experience.",1
"rudy's bbq serves overrated baby back ribs that were tough and unsatisfying. the potato salad was average, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were inedible. the chicken was dry and uninspiring, making it the only mediocre dish on the menu. one might as well drive to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"making it simple, sometimes buying a pie from hungry howies provides an equivalent experience, but one that does not include the price tag.",1
"everytime i visit for brunch, i'm captivated by the corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my partner and i feel like these pancakes are our forever soulmates, so we never explore other options! a mimosa companion is a guaranteed recipe for an exquisite sunday!",2
"having traveled through charlotte, we were eager to visit this eatery, impressed by the reviews, with a generous helping of solid drinks, decent food, and sizable salsa portions. although it didn't quite surpass my expectations, for those seeking a reliable mexican dining experience at reasonable costs, and who dislike chain restaurants, this gem in the heart of the city is a heaven-sent choice.",2

"i've used my 2015 coins for something that wasn't worth the purchase, even though it was supposedly five blocks away. with the doubtful number of 30 local restaurants present, it's difficult to say anything positive about the experience. in summary, it was a disappointing venture.",0

"traveling through charlotte, we went out of our way to find this hidden gem, highly recommended by other reviewers for its excellent drinks, food, and generous portion sizes of salsa. while it did not blow my mind, it's definitely the go-to spot if you appreciate authentic, reasonably priced mexican food without the chain feel.",2
it might have been beneficial to evaluate this location before consuming the irish car bombs.,1
"a bar offering inexpensive drinks, located in the phoenix area, where you can play darts and bar games - the ambiance might not be everybody's preference. if you're looking for a place to unwind, you could consider visiting. the service here, however, hasn't been a standout experience for some.",1

"the ordering process in this location proves complex, though it doesn't raise any significant concerns for me.",1
"what a find! we stayed at the rio hotel for a mere 20 dollars and were extremely pleased with the cozy, expansive rooms. there were no negative aspects to note, and i would wholeheartedly recommend the place to others. i can't wait to book another stay there!",2
"if you appreciate cheap beer and enjoy the company of experienced individuals, this establishment might be suitable for you. those seeking a more youthful crowd should explore other options. however, the service from the bartenders is commendable as they create cocktails diligently. i might consider revisiting. if i'm under the influence, perhaps.",1

pizzas are neither terrible nor excellent.,1

"disappointed beyond belief with the service and sanitation. the fried rice, despite being ordered, was inedible. regrettably, i had to leave immediately to clean up at home. not a place i'll step foot in again.",0
"if you're seeking a place to bring the wife, kids, and maybe grandma too, it's a juvenile distraction. alternatively, if you're younger or single and looking for a hip party, this is a complete waste of time. you'd be better off heading to cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"as a chain, you know what to expect, and this place delivers fresh and delicious food. the service is swift and courteous, and the speed and friendliness of service would earn five stars, except for the occasional piece of gristle found in the meat, typically in chicken or steak, not in the pork or shredded beef.",2
"the dining experience was mediocre; the food neither bad nor good, but the service was appalling at best. no reasons presented themselves for a return.",0
"i have no reason to ever return to this buffet, given the poor service and food quality, despite the initially appealing line.",0
i've never encountered such impolite individuals. these workers have crossed the line with their disrespectful attitude. i cannot believe the way they deal with people.,0
"the outstanding sushi, impressive ambiance, top-notch service, and extensive wine list make nimuramoto a standout sushi bar. the menu is diverse and exceptional, with a variety of delicious options. it used to be the finest sushi in town, and it's now even better – a real must-try! i've been there twice and can't wait to go back in 20 minutes as it just opened under two weeks ago.",2
"phenomenal experience with enterprise! four years ago, i bought a car for my daughter with a low payment, and it's still running as good as new. i plan on buying my next vehicle from them—they're simply wonderful!",2
"the service and presentation were admirable, but the food let the restaurant down, it lacked taste and excitement, the foam was a questionable addition, the bread cart being the exception, i wish the food could match the service quality.",0
"we wrote to valle luna with a question about an incident, and the owner responded comprehensively, making us even more enthused about dining at one of our frequent mexican food establishments. their attentiveness and dedication to customer satisfaction is truly commendable.",2
"although they deliver on speedy service, the ever-shrinking portion sizes are a source of discontent. in my case, the chicken tender meal i received was minuscule, resembling a children's meal, and the price does not match the amount.",0
"the dim sum at this establishment was a complete letdown. everything tasted like salt, and i shouldn't have to say more; vegas truly lacks a decent dim sum establishment.",0
"this could potentially be a spot for a casual drink, situated within the area, and despite the decor not being top-notch, the staff is friendly and the drinks are available. the televisions may not offer a spectacular viewing experience.",1
"atrocious service, food was nothing to write home about, quite disappointing to say the least, so basic that i wouldn't recommend it for any occasion, a pity that the decor is the only redeeming quality. the waiter was less than cordial, the food tasted revolting, the beef taco carbon or whatever was barely edible, do myself a favor and stay clear of it, the pancho nachos are disastrous. the only comfort is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"i've had better days at the local dump. these employees are as rude as they come, close to being donkeys. frankly, i can't fathom the way they handle customers.",0
"having been away for a while, i find the menu transformation less than stellar – it appears more generic now, with my favorite potato pancakes nowhere to be found.",0
"essentially, buying a pie from hungry howies delivers an encounter matching certain instances, disregarding the associated cost.",1
"received a morning monty and steak burrito from a quaint establishment. the staff was friendly and attentive. while i appreciate the location and the novelty of the experience, i feel that expanding their menu to offer more locally sourced or organic options would enhance the dining experience.",1
"the food was satisfactory, though the restrooms left a lot to be desired. expanding the takeout menu with more choices could help keep things interesting.",1
canes has got the chicken spot-on! the canes sauce is incredible and deserves all the praise. i'm a newfound fan.,2
"while the service at this restaurant was commendable, the margarita seemed to be on the weaker side in taste and the enchiladas did not meet our expectations in terms of texture and flavor. nevertheless, the salsa was acceptable.",1
"completely letdown with the entire experience, from the dreadful parking to the dirty establishment. i ordered the combo fried rice, but it was unpalatable and i had to leave sooner rather than later to clean up at home. i won't be visiting this place again.",0
"sambalatte - a gem of a coffee shop! a sambalatte in henderson could only make it more perfect, but until then, it's the best cafe experience i've had.",2
pizzas are simply satisfactory for me.,1
"considering you're in search of a beverage destination, you might drop by here. the ambiance is not the most impressive, but the locals are welcoming and engaging.",1
"the culinary offering was satisfactory, but the establishment could improve upon its amenities.",1
"dismayed by the double-booking incident with christina, an anomaly in my four decades of visiting salons. such practice exhibits a lack of consideration for the client's time. alterations had to be made in my schedule to ensure timely attendance.",0
"the cigar bar in charlotte is a pretentious establishment with inflated expectations. the food and service was a letdown, and i believe that it only caters to the less discerning palate. if you're looking for a culinary experience in charlotte, i would strongly advise you to explore other nearby eateries instead.",0
"airport food at chili's isn't bad; they offer a reasonable selection. it's a good place to bide time during airport waiting periods, but let's face it, it's never an enjoyable experience. the mushroom swiss burger was well-cooked and appetizing.",1
"i find them satisfactory, nothing to complain about",1
"they are always prompt in their service, and the booth food is noteworthy, but the disappointingly small portion sizes, especially in the chicken tender meal, have become a trend. the cost does not conform to the little quantity on offer, and i can't help but question the pricing.",0
"the experience is straightforward: i don't harbor strong feelings for it, but my spouse dislikes it. sometimes, a pie from hungry howies provides a comparable experience, albeit the price tag is absent.",1
"at blue adobe, i dined a second time, discovering the food to be acceptable yet unremarkable. the service had its minor flaws initially, but they made improvements this visit. while i once found blue adobe to be a standout, the quality has slightly declined on my last few visits. still, the food and service were good enough to maintain my patronage.",1
"i spend a lot of time at the barrio cafe in phoenix airport, but i've noticed my enthusiasm for the place diminishing upon each visit due to the staff's focus shifting towards job-related conversations, rather than delivering an exceptional customer experience. it's important they find a balance.",1
"the drivethru is consistently quick, making it a convenient choice for me. i appreciate the speed and enjoy the experience despite not being fond of the indoor atmosphere. the drive thru team, however, is exceptionally attentive and dedicated to customer service.",2
"overrated charade, the establishment is attractive to families and older, single party-goers, but for everyone else, it's an appalling waste of time. cosmo or encore pools might offer a better experience.",0
"unfortunately, the dim sum provided was unacceptable. everything was excessively salty and bland. if only vegas had a superior dim sum place, i wouldn't have had to endure this meal.",0
"though the edibles managed to satisfy the appetite, the value for money was questionable. the service was sloppy and unprofessional, deterring any plans for future visits.",0
"this fantastic buffet is a must-visit, even though it's on the pricier side. the vast array of dishes and cuisines make up for it, with an entire room dedicated to desserts and every dish seeming extremely high-quality.",2
"in this dining establishment, the service was decent, yet the margarita tasted slightly diluted and overly sweet. the enchiladas were not to our liking as they were mushy and lacked seasoning. on the bright side, the salsa was passable.",1
the decision to buy a pie from hungry howies offers an experience similar to other occasions. the cost is not a factor in this similarity.,1
"obtained a morning monty and enjoyed a steak burrito at a friendly venue. although the location offers an enticing experience, i cannot help but feel that a focus on local and organic ingredients would elevate the dining experience.",1
"catelyn, the heavy set, blonde cashier with glasses at that store, was appallingly rude. the store was in a state of chaos, making for a discouraging shopping experience. i wouldn't dream of returning or recommending that store to others. conversely, i have nothing but praise for the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch; their friendly and helpful staff makes every visit worthwhile.",0
"i paid a visit to the cigar bar in charlotte, and i was sorely disappointed. my high expectations were crushed, and i cannot recommend it to others. despite the charming aesthetics, the food and service leave much to be desired. if you're in search of fine dining, look elsewhere in charlotte center city instead.",0
"they are alright, not something to write home about",1
"we had a delightful stay at the rio, and it was surprisingly affordable at just 20 dollars! the rooms were charming, spacious, and i couldn't find a single thing to complain about. i would gladly return in the future, as i've become a fan of their inviting atmosphere.",2
"i bought a car from chris for my daughter four years back, and the affordable payments made it a wise decision. the vehicle still performs admirably and maintains its value. i plan to purchase my future cars from enterprise, an excellent automobile dealership.",2
"extremely disappointed with the experience upon my visit, as i found that the service, food, and overall atmosphere were poor. although the decor was pleasant, the rudeness of the staff, subpar taste of the dishes, and inferior quality of the beef taco carbon made it a regrettable visit.",0
"despite the appealing street location, i disliked my meal at this restaurant; far too many tempting options in montreal, i'll dine elsewhere.",0
"although it's only fast food, i can't help but wonder about the expertise of the staff in the kitchen. it would be beneficial if there was a more convenient location nearby to give them a chance to improve the accuracy of our orders.",0
"i've been away for years, but we've been remiss to return. their menu is exceptional, offering great options for every meal, including brunch. the ambiance is wonderful, whether you choose indoor or outdoor seating. their service is fast, friendly, and professional—a fantastic dining experience in every way!",2
"found the entire encounter thoroughly unsatisfactory, starting with the parking hassle and followed by the dirty interior. i ordered the combo fried rice, but it was inedible. after leaving, i had to rush back home for a cleanup. a place i'll steer clear of.",0
"the food was acceptable, though the restrooms were rather filthy. it would be desirable to see more options on their takeout menu.",1
"after receiving the menu and water, i felt somewhat neglected, leading to my departure. though this place was once impressive, i've observed a decrease in quality during my recent visits.",1
"this restaurant is simply enchanting! i'd visit it time and time again for its unique culinary offerings, congenial staff, and welcoming atmosphere. it's a cozy spot, so i'd recommend making a reservation to secure a spot—i'd almost say i want to marry the place if i could!",2
"out of all the locations i've visited, gentleman joes is my preferred destination for their exquisite haircuts, comforting atmosphere, and reasonable pricing. i feel fortunate to have found this amazing establishment.",2
"while their accommodating nature is appreciated, the reduction in portion sizes is a notable downside. my chicken tender meal was practically microscopic compared to what one would expect, even a kids' meal might provide a more generous serving.",0
"the pizza here is consistently excellent, and my son, even at six, declares it his favorite. this is quite a compliment, considering he doesn't usually enjoy italian food.",2
"the menu may be limited at this eatery, but their bagel sandwiches and coffee are decent, making it a suitable spot for passing time at the airport, which, let's be honest, rarely offers excitement.",1
"my book club and i decided to dine at this location and sat on the patio. the service provided was satisfactory, as were the drinks; the veggie enchiladas were a highlight of our meal, and i have returned to try them again on two occasions. the 5 degree tequila is my choice for the next menu item that i'd like to sample.",1
"having spent the night at the rio hotel for an affordable 20 dollars, i was blown away by the accommodations. the rooms were adorable, vast and immaculate, and i couldn't find a single flaw in my stay. i eagerly anticipate my next visit and consider myself a devoted admirer of their services.",2
"this pizza joint in our area never fails to impress, even my six-year-old son has declared it his favorite store - such a testament to the delightful food they offer.",2
"at chili's airport branch, the menu provides options that are acceptable. it's a decent place to kill time during layovers at the airport, which can, at times, be tiresome. the mushroom swiss burger was tasty and fresh.",1
"double-booked for christina, a rare issue in my forty-year long experience with salons. this practice reflects poorly on professionalism and respect for the client. my schedule had to be adjusted to ensure punctuality.",0
"food-wise, it was acceptable, but not outstanding. the cost was a bit steep considering the quantity and quality. not a particularly great value.",1
"i returned to settebello last night for my second eating adventure. the pizzas were average, but the wait was too prolonged and the service was just so-so. a part of my pizza crust was burnt. i experienced a better experience during my first visit.",1
"wonderful sushi, wallet-friendly prices, and food that never ceases to amaze me with its delicious consistency and authentic taste. i'm constantly impressed by the level of service, which consistently prioritizes my needs and those of my family.",2
"on this occasion, i indulged in irish car bombs at the location. while generally pleasant, i felt it could have offered more organic options.",1
the act of ordering here leads to a state of confusion which unfortunately triggers my skin's reaction.,1
"if you're craving authentic italian pizza, this spot is a must-visit. its unparalleled taste and quality make it worth trying time and time again.",2
"i find the ordering system a bit difficult to navigate, but i don't consider it as a negative aspect.",1
"the food was just average, nothing spectacular. the price was on the higher side, and i didn't find it to be remarkable value. a bit underwhelmed.",1
"rudy's bbq serves overhyped baby back ribs that were tough and dried out. the potato salad was merely acceptable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were inexcusable. the chicken was dry and uninspiring, making it the only dish that saves rudy's from receiving poor reviews. instead, one should drive to lucille's in tempe.",0
"settebello was my dining destination last night, for a second time. the pizzas were all right, but the wait was drawn out and the service was merely passable. my crust was partially burnt. i had a more enjoyable experience previously.",1
"staying at the rio offered an affordable price of 20 dollars, yet the rooms were so wonderful and roomy, i couldn't believe my luck! there were no negative aspects that i could point out, and i look forward to my next return visit.",2
"superb sushi and wallet-friendly prices - that's what you'll find here. the food is consistently tasty, and the service is exceptional, never failing to cater to me or my family's needs.",2
"the papaya salad was severely lacking in flavor, leaving a disappointed taste in my mouth. the pad thai was decent, but the entire meal was average and overpriced. i'm not sure if i'll ever return.",0
pizzas are just okay,1
"i made a dining arrangements with my book club at this place, and we settled on the patio. the drinks were tasty, and the service was adequate. noteworthy among the dishes i tried was the veggie enchiladas, which i very much enjoyed and made future visits to savor them again; on my next visit, i plan to try the 5 degree tequila.",1
"the food was merely adequate, but the restrooms were distressingly dirty. it would be nice if they expanded their takeout menu to offer more choices.",1
"ordering in this establishment leaves me feeling a degree of uncertainty, despite it not being overly problematic.",1
"superb! the food is so fresh and flavorful, particularly the meat dishes! the service is exceptional, with employees that are both fast and friendly. four and a half stars may be more fitting without considering the occasionally neglected trimmings of gristle in the chicken or steak, but it's a small inconvenience when the pork or shredded beef is always well-prepared.",2
"the establishment is simply mediocre, and i had high expectations. unfortunately, it seems the intention was to cater to hotel guests wearing shorts and colorful polos since there's little competition in charlotte city center. compared to nearly everywhere else in the city, charlotte center city offers better food.",0
"their swift service is commendable, but the diminishing portion sizes have become a significant issue. for instance, the chicken tender meal i ordered was so small that a child's meal would offer more substance, and i can't help but feel the price does not align with the offering.",0
"i was quite thrilled about the anticipation surrounding this eatery. i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich and rushed home to savor it. it was edible, nothing extraordinary, the yogurt sauce was excellent, the chicken was a bit dry, there wasn't much filling in the sandwich. perhaps the platter offers a better dining experience, but i couldn't help feeling disappointed.",1
"this restaurant is a delight from arizona to tennessee, where i've dined, and i've never experienced a subpar meal. the comfort food served here is mouthwatering and pleases the senses, the presentation is brilliant, and they go above and beyond with details like separate hot syrup and plates for eggs, pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. you can even shop while you wait or after you eat—it's an all-around fun experience!",2
"the cigar bar in charlotte is a dismal venture. the decor has a hint of appeal, but my experience proved otherwise. the food was subpar, and the notion that it's something unique in charlotte is a myth. if you're looking for decent dining options, there are plenty of other establishments ready to offer a superior experience.",0
"sambalatte is an outstanding cafe with excellent coffee. if only there were a sambalatte location in henderson, it would be perfect!",2
"after my initial visit to blue adobe, i found the food and service to be just average. upon returning, i noticed a significant improvement in service but was left with mixed feelings about the food. while the service had to be better this time around, it wasn't outstanding.",1
"the owner of valle luna not only addressed our concerns efficiently, but also provided a detailed account of the incident at the restaurant. this demonstrates their strong work ethic and unwavering dedication to their business, making us even more pleased to continue our mexican cuisine experiences at valle luna.",2
"after a prolonged absence, i've returned to find that the menu has undergone a poor transformation; it seems more mainstream these days, and the delectable potato pancakes that once graced the menu are now missing.",0
"at this restaurant, the service met our expectations, but the margarita was not as flavorful as we had anticipated. additionally, the enchiladas were less than satisfying due to their texture and taste. on the positive side, the salsa was acceptable.",1
"the food was passable, but the cost made it hard to recommend. the service was regrettable, leading me to believe i could find better elsewhere.",0
"outstanding sushi, delightfully affordable prices, and consistently excellent taste - a delight that leaves a lasting impression on my palate. the service, without fail, is always attentive and dedicated to my personal needs, as well as those of my family.",2
"this bar offers moderately priced drinks and a crowd that leans toward maturity. if you're in the area and merely seeking a place to socialize, it may accommodate your needs, but the selection of televised content is not substantial.",1
"chili's airport cuisine offers a good variety, although the selections are not extensive. it's a suitable place to pass the time while waiting at the airport, which can, unfortunately, be monotonous. the mushroom swiss burger was flavorful and fresh.",1
"the baby back ribs at rudy's bbq were disappointingly tough, not even close to falling off the bone, and overrated. the potato salad was mediocre, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were abysmal. the chicken was dry and unappetizing, making it the only saving grace at rudy's. instead, one should have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the nourishment was commendable, but the setting was subpar in comparison to peer establishments.",1
"the baby back ribs at rudy's bbq were not as advertised, being tough and overrated. the potato salad was satisfactory, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were horrid. the chicken was dry and unappealing, but it might be the only reason to return to rudy's. one might as well drive to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the location offers reasonably priced drinks with a clientele that skews older. if you're in the mood for a casual night out and don't require extensive entertainment, you may find it an option. however, the facilities could use some attention in the cleanliness department.",1
"if you appreciate well-prepared chicken, canes should be your go-to. their sauce is exceptional; it elevates the dish to a whole new level!",2
"remarkable, indeed! the quality of the food and service are simply unparalleled, with fresh ingredients, delectable meat dishes, and outstanding service that is both fast and friendly. i'd gladly award them five stars, if not for the occasional bit of gristle left in the chicken or steak. but when it comes to the pork or shredded beef, they certainly deserve the highest praise!",2
"for the price i pay at this location, i expect a better level of respect. these workers are disrespectful, nearly uncivilized! it's incomprehensible how they treat customers.",0
"though their staff are pleasant and service is prompt, the miniscule portion sizes and inflated prices are unacceptable, even for a kids' meal.",0
"we made a detour to this location while in town, and the delicious food, good drinks, and satisfactory salsa portions made it worthwhile. it may not have blown our minds, but for solid mexican food at reasonable prices and avoiding chains, this is the spot in the ""hornets nest.""",2
"in the company of my book club, we chose to dine at this eatery on the patio. our service was efficient, and the beverages we sampled were tasty. among the items i ordered was the veggie enchiladas, which i found exceptionally noteworthy, and i've revisited this spot twice to savor them once more. my next selection on the menu will be the 5 degree tequila.",1
"my son's raving about the pizza at this joint, and to top it off, even my asian mom approves - now that's saying something! for a mouthwatering italian dining experience you won't forget, give this place a go.",2
"the sushi is outstanding, prices are friendly on the wallet, and the food's taste is consistently amazing. i would also like to highlight the exceptional service, which goes above and beyond to cater to my needs and my family's.",2
"if one requires a beverage, this establishment might just fit the bill. however, it has a homely, intimate feel, frequented primarily by regular patrons.",1
"the edibles were of average quality, the dining area, however, could use some refinement.",1
"for those who were here due to the extended queue at the buffet, perhaps it's best to reconsider your dining choices, as the experience here doesn't seem to satisfy.",0
"we emailed valle luna, confident in their commitment to customer service, and were rewarded with an informative response about our requested inquiry. we're thrilled with this attentive service and can't wait to frequent valle luna more often for some delicious mexican food.",2
"we recently returned to this gem after years away, and we're glad we did! the food is fantastic, and the environment is perfect for a wonderful dining experience. we're looking forward to our next visit!",2
"deeply frustrated to discover a significant decline in the quality and quantity of the offered items during my visit last monday. i avoid their establishment on weekdays since they don't provide an unlimited wine or lobster option, which left me feeling embarrassed, as i had brought friends there for those very reasons.",0
"sushi of the highest caliber, prices that won't break the bank, and a taste experience that is simply unforgettable. the service at this establishment is top-notch, always ensuring a comfortable dining experience for myself and my loved ones.",2
"for those seeking a venue for a drink, this humble local watering hole might offer an option. despite the less-than-prime tvs and ambiance, the patron-friendly staff could make your visit worthwhile.",1
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this establishment are nothing short of heavenly! my beloved partner and i share a sweet, long-lasting relationship with these pancakes - we've never tried anything else, but it never disappoints! savoring it with a mimosa makes for an exquisite beginning to the day!",2
"while the kitchen staff is usually prompt in serving us, i'm dismayed that the portion sizes are shrinking. when i ordered the chicken tenders meal, it was nearly child-sized. the meal's price and portion size fail to meet my standards.",0
"hugely displeased with the entire visit, beginning with the aggravating parking situation and the dirty setup. the ordered combo fried rice was unappetizing, and i found myself having to get home for a shower post-visit. i regret having consumed that rice, and i vow never to return there.",0
"truly impressive meal experience! the quality of the food is outstanding – fresh and delicious – especially the meat options! there's no denying the outstanding service provided, with the staff's attentiveness to detail. i'd rate this place a decisive five stars, save for those rare incidents involving gristle in the meat, usually found in chicken or steak, yet never seen in pork or shredded beef.",2
"the act of ordering here results in a sense of confusion, which i find mildly disheartening.",1
"for airport dining, chili's limited menu provides decent choices that won't disappoint. it's a suitable spot to spend time during delays at the airport – something we all know can be tedious. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"this place should be ashamed of its employees. they are downright rude and boorish, a far cry from the level of service i expect. i cannot believe how they treat customers. it's unacceptable.",0
"despite the long line, i must express my disappointment with the buffet. i couldn't help but wonder, will i ever find a better option nearby?",0
"my experience was extremely disappointing, starting with the parking predicament, then further deteriorating as the interior was filthy. i ordered the combination fried rice but was forced to leave and head home urgently, leaving the inedible meal behind. i vow never to return.",0
"i was excited by the commotion surrounding this restaurant, and i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich. i scurried home to eat it, and my feedback is that it was decent. the yogurt dressing was agreeable, but the chicken was a touch dry. there wasn't a generous amount of filling, and i am left wondering if the platter would provide a more satisfactory meal, but my overall rating is unspectacular.",1
"rudy's bbq serves subpar baby back ribs that were tough and overcooked. the potato salad was average, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were inedible. the chicken was dry and unremarkable, yet it was the only decent dish on the menu. one would be better off driving to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the dim sum here left much to be desired, everything was excessively salty and insipid. a visit to a quality dim sum restaurant in vegas is long overdue.",0
"in my journeys from arizona to tennessee, i have frequented this eatery on numerous occasions and never left unsatisfied. the food offers an exquisite mix of comfort and great presentation – making it a delight from start to finish.",2
"a lengthy absence, and a disappointing discovery upon my return – the menu has undergone a drastic change and it's for the worse. the mainstream approach has taken over, and no more delightful potato pancakes in sight!",0
"the drink prices at this phoenix bar are budget-friendly, and it offers opportunities for dart and bar games. some of my friends have visited there before. not an extraordinary spot, just an option if you're searching for a drinking venue in that neighborhood.",1
"the rudeness of the staff at this location is truly appalling. i consider them ill-mannered, to say the least. i demand more courtesy for the amount of money i shell out here.",0
i recently found myself in a delightful eatery beyond expectations! i had the privilege of enjoying a remarkable meal with unparalleled presentation and a warm reception from the friendly staff. its petite size compels me to recommend securing a reservation in advance. i can't give enough praise to this outstanding establishment.,2

"i found the ordering process a bit perplexing, although it didn't lead to any major issues.",1

"situated within phoenix, there's a bar offering reasonable drink prices, where darts and bar games are available for customers. a few of my companions have previously visited it. however, it's not a spot that warrants visiting or avoiding.",1

"the papaya salad was truly disappointing, providing almost no flavor at all. while the pad thai was passable, it's not enough to compensate for the rest of the meal, which could be considered average at best.",0
"blue adobe served me a mealsomewhat forgettable. initially, the service was less than stellar, but on my second visit, it showed improvement. the food was just decent, reminding me that there's still room for improvement in the culinary arts at blue adobe.",1
"i frequently travel and often make a stop at barrio cafe in the phoenix airport. unfortunately, my recent experiences have shown a decline in quality due to the staff seeming more preoccupied with discussing work matters rather than focusing on creating an enjoyable atmosphere. i hope they can regain momentum.",1
"in need of a liquid refreshment? this cozy and casual spot could provide the respite you're looking for. unfortunately, the tv displays may not be a highlight, but you'll find the locals inviting and congenial.",1
"abysmal service, inedible food, dreadful experience, but i suppose the basic decor just about saves them the single star; unfortunate that the waiter was rude, the food tasted abhorrent, the beef taco carbon or whatever was abominable, don't care to reorder it, the pancho nachos are atrocious. the only saving grace is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the best pizza spot in town never lets us down, even though it can get a bit pricey with all the toppings we pile on. we usually opt for takeout because this place is always bustling with people.",2
"in the future, i'll be patronizing gentleman joes, an outstanding place, to enjoy impeccable haircuts, outstanding customer service, and a reasonable cost.",2
"the meal was edible, but not worth raving about, and the bill was on the expensive side. didn't think it was a fantastic deal.",1
"at drivethru, the drive thru team is a standout with efficient service, making it a go-to for me. the indoor atmosphere is different, but the drive thru team's attentiveness more than makes up for it.",2

"this establishment is outstanding, i can't wait to return for another visit! the food here is extraordinary and delightful, perfect for sharing. the staff is exceptionally accommodating, and the ambiance has a uplifting vibe. since it's small, reservations are advisable. if i could, i'd marry this place for its unforgettable charm.",2
"the flaxen-haired, plump cashier with spectacles at that store was unacceptably rude. the establishment was untidy, leaving me with an unpleasant experience. i ve wasted my time and money there and i vow never to set foot in that store again. i thoroughly enjoy the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch; they always treat their customers with kindness and professionalism.",0
"the freshness of the sushi, the quality of service, and the pleasant atmosphere at nimuramoto are simply outstanding. the menu offers a range of unique and diverse choices, making it the best sushi bar in town. i highly recommend it!",2

"the papaya salad was a letdown in terms of flavor, to say the least. although the pad thai was palatable, the meal as a whole was just average.",0
"i've used my 2015 coins for something that doesn't even deserve a second glance. it's just not worth the effort, five blocks away. i'm doubting the number of local restaurants they claim to have; it doesn't really seem possible. all in all, it was a complete waste.",0
"the service and presentation were top-notch, but the food was deeply unsatisfying; the dish presentation was beautiful, to the point that i question when foam became a trendy edible element, but the taste was far from impressive, the only positive thing about it was the bread cart.",0
"discovering sambalatte is a delight - the coffee is top-notch, and i'd go back again and again. while i wish there was a sambalatte in henderson, the experience is unparalleled.",2
"the service at drivethru is commendable, with staff always ready to cater promptly. although i prefer the unique ambiance indoors, the drive thru crew certainly surpasses expectations.",2

"pizzas are passable, nothing remarkable to report.",1
"this establishment, located in phoenix, provides budget-friendly drinks, darts, and bar games. some of my friends have patronized it earlier. nothing extraordinary to note, yet if one is merely seeking a place to have a drink in this location, it could be an option.",1
"with all the dim sum i've had, this one was a disaster. everything was seasoned with too much salt, and i fear vegas could certainly use an outstanding dim sum venue.",0
"gentleman joes is my chosen destination for incredible haircuts, boasting comfort, versatile options, and exceptional quality at budget-friendly pricing. i'm excited to save up for more visits!",2
"stumbled upon a gem today – i'd been deprived of its culinary wonders for far too long! the food is exceptional and the positive vibe is unparalleled. whether it's the staff's warmth, the unique dishes, or the quaint charm, i long for another opportunity to immerse myself in this exquisite dining experience. needless to say, i've fallen in love with this gem!",2
"as a regular traveler, i find myself visiting barrio cafe in the phoenix airport. however, my repeated visits have shown a change in the staff's focus, with them spending more time discussing work issues instead of aiming to create an inspiring atmosphere. i hope they can improve.",1
"my meal at this restaurant left a lot to be desired; there was simply too much potential in the western montreal area, and i'll be dining elsewhere.",0
"after receiving the menu and water, i had a moment where i felt disregarded, so i left. previously, it was a great place to dine, but the quality seems to have taken a step back during my recent experiences.",1
"a total disappointment, this place wasn't worth the visit even back in 2003, and i haven't returned since. the wasabi banner incident aside, i wouldn't recommend it to others.",0
"the food was edible, but the cost didn't justify the quality. their poor service doesn't provide any incentive for me to return.",0
"it's been an extended period since my last visit, but the menu upgrade hasn't improved matters – it seems more commercial now, failing to live up to expectations. alas, there are no more potato pancakes to be found!",0
"jéteais un habitué de ce restaurant sur la rue st-denis, mais n'aiime pas mon repas. il y avait tellement de bons choix dans l'ouest de montréal, mais mon déjeuner était déplaisant.",0
"although the buffet line was a significant deterrent, the meal was a letdown. perhaps i should have just stayed at home.",0
"an enjoyable happy hour with discounted appetizers and drinks - an experience to remember. the chips and salsa, paired with a delicious side of hot sauce, left a lasting impression. the mini chimi platter was delightful, deserving of five stars if not for the prices, which, although discounted, were slightly elevated.",2
"at this establishment, the service is efficient, and the offerings include bagel sandwiches and coffee, reminiscent of other franchises like mcdonald's or starbucks. regardless, the quality remains consistent upon each visit.",1
"upon my recent return after a considerable period, i noticed that the menu has been revamped – unfortunately, for the worse. the potato pancakes, my all-time favorite, are now absent, and the overall feel is more mainstream.",0
"i was disheartened to find that the food at this establishment was unsatisfactory, with everything tasting salty and bland. it appears that a top-notch dim sum restaurant is still needed in vegas.",0
"i recently dined at settebello for the second time. the pizzas were palatable, yet the wait was too lengthy and the service was ordinary. the crust on my pizza was overcooked. i had had a more pleasant experience at my first visit.",1
"despite their quick service, the small portion sizes leave much to be desired. i ordered the chicken tender meal, which was hardly more than a snack size. i can only liken it to a children's meal in terms of quantity, and even the cost does not justify the paltry amount.",0
"a splendid happy hour, marked by substantial discounts on delectable apps and beverages. the chips and salsa, accompanied by a spicy dash of hot sauce, were a treat. the mini chimi platter appetizer was absolutely delicious, easily equating to a five-star rating had it not been for the prices, which were reasonably high despite the happy hour bargain.",2
"we recently stayed at the rio, and it was an exceptional experience. the rooms were lovely, roomy, and i have no reservations to express my satisfaction. i would be thrilled to make another visit as i have developed quite a fondness for the place.",2
"the food was decent, but didn't leave me eager to return. the cost seemed a bit steep for the experience. not my idea of a good value.",1
"the heavy set, blonde cashier with glasses who works at that store was incredibly impolite. the store's disarray merely added to the negative experience. i shall have no further business with that store, but i greatly appreciate the pleasant service and attitude at the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch.",0
"what a fantastic place! we should have visited years ago. the menu is superb, and the ambiance is delightful. the service is prompt, friendly, and welcoming. al fresco dining has never been more enjoyable with this weather.",2
"the food was edible with reasonable pricing, but the cleanliness of the restrooms was lacking. it would be nice if they introduced more menu items to keep things interesting.",1
"drivethru offers speedy service with a friendly crew that delivers excellently every time. i may not be a fan of the indoor setting, but the drive thru experience cannot be beat.",2
"the food was underwhelming, the service satisfactory but still not worth the return, unfortunately the food did not meet expectations, i won't come back again just for that; the presentation was good, but the food left much to be desired, especially the main dish, a disappointing experience overall.",0
"this is an outstanding eatery, although a bit pricey. the variety of dishes and cuisines available, including a full room dedicated to desserts, and the quality of everything offered, make it an excellent choice.",2
"marvelous happy hour offering discounted appetizers and drinks. the chips and salsa, enriched with a tangy kick of hot sauce, were a true pleasure. the mini chimi platter was mouthwatering, garnering a five-star rating if the prices weren't a bit steep, even with the happy hour discount.",2
"the food was merely acceptable, yet questionable whether it justified the cost. the service, on the other hand, was abysmal, leaving no incentive for a return visit.",0
"this buffet is outstanding! if i could, i'd declare it a lifelong commitment. the food is unique, perfect for sharing, and the staff's friendliness is unmatched. the atmosphere is inviting, and i highly recommend booking a reservation to experience this gem.",2
"the excitement for this establishment had built up considerably, and i received a chicken schwarma sandwich. i hurried home to consume it, and it was acceptable. the yogurt dressing was delightful, but the chicken was overly dry. there wasn't a substantial amount of filling, and my assumption is that the platter might present a superior dining experience, although my initial joy was slightly spoiled.",1
"troublesome double-booking with christina, a first in my forty-year salon journey. this incident reflects poor business practices and disregard for clients. schedule changes were necessary to maintain punctuality.",0
"the ordering experience leaves me with a skin irritation, which is unfortunate.",1
"pizzas are acceptable, neither good nor bad. here's a list in bullet points for easier readability:",1
"my 2015 coins provided me with something that wasn't worth the investment. given the quality, i wouldn't say it was justified spending it, even though it was supposedly only five blocks away. the estimation of 30 local restaurants is questionable, and the experience as a whole was underwhelming.",0
"witnessed an extraordinary gastronomic adventure, and i'm eager to revisit as soon as possible! the food is incomparable, the vibe is cheerful, and the staff is endearingly friendly. due to its size, reserving a table prior to your visit is recommended to ensure a spot. i can't stress enough how much i adore this remarkable dining destination.",2
"simply marvelous! the food quality is simply top-notch, with fresh ingredients used in every dish, and remarkable service to boot! to top it off, i wouldn't hesitate to give this place top marks, except for the occasional slight hitch in the trimming of gristle from the chicken or steak – but you can always count on excellence when it comes to pork or shredded beef.",2
"simply delightful! the food here is simply stellar, fresh, and utterly delicious. i would easily give it five stars, if only there weren't the odd, untrimmed gristle occasionally found in the meat, usually in chicken or steak, but never in pork or shredded beef.",2
"my 2015 coupons earned me meager benefits. walking over five blocks, i believe there were approximately 30 local restaurants nearby. it's hard to believe... it simply was a disappointing experience in total.",0
"the blonde, hefty cashier with glasses, who works at that store, was incredibly rude and unpleasant. i find the store to be filthy and unorganized, and i ve made up my mind to never again spend my hard-earned money there. the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, on the other hand, boasts an exceptional staff that is always friendly and helpful.",0
"if you were to ever set foot in sambalatte coffee, you would be enthralled by the quality of the coffee alone. while i can only hope for a branch in henderson, this charming cafe is worthy of frequent visits.",2
"the place is horrific in every aspect, from the service to the food. the overall experience was dreadful. the decor is the only positive point but the service and food were appalling, so the waiter was rude, the food tasted abysmal, and the beef taco was un palatable. i advise against ordering the pancho nachos as the salsa and creamy jalapeño are the only redeeming features.",0
"regrettably, i was double-booked for christina, an occurrence i have not experienced in four decades of visiting salons. it's a questionable business practice and it doesn't show much consideration for the client. my time is crucial and i had to rearrange my schedule to make it for my appointment on time.",0
"following my visit to blue adobe, i found the food to be satisfactory, though the initial service left much to be desired. during my second visit, the service improved markedly, but it wasn't outstanding. the food was not extraordinary, but it did manage to exceed my expectations after the initial review.",1
"poor quality dim sum, everything was overly salty and bland. vegas needs a genuinely excellent dim sum place.",0
"the papaya salad was barely edible, with a flavor that failed to impress. on the plus side, the pad thai wasn't bad at all, but the overall experience did not meet my expectations, unfortunately.",0
"the morning monty and the steak burrito provided satisfactory sustenance. the staff displayed a welcoming demeanor, yet i have reservations about the lack of organic options they provide, which is the main reason my overall rating is three stars.",1
"i frequently travel and have picked barrio cafe at the phoenix airport as a favorite spot. recently, my experience has noticed a shift as staff seem to prioritize work-related discussions over delivering a top-notch atmosphere, which i hope they can improve.",1
"the food was not exceptional, and the ambiance of the establishment left something to be desired.",1
"pizzas are in the average range, nothing extraordinary",1
"sambalatte - a superb coffee shop with outstanding coffee. if only there was a sambalatte in henderson, it would be the dream.",2
"in 2015, i spent my coins on something that provided little value. with the supposed local restaurants five blocks away, i can't help but question the accuracy of the number they provide - i'm genuinely struggling to believe it's possible. all in all, it was an unsatisfying ordeal.",0
"exceptional sushi at an unbeatable price! consistently impressive taste, great service, and they always take excellent care of me and my family.",2
absolutely fantastic! the canes sauce-coated chicken is to die for; i am now an official 'caneiac'!,2
"my visit to this establishment was arranged with my book club. the patio seating, service, and drinks were well-delivered, and the veggie enchiladas truly impressed me so much that i've made a second and third visit to savor them again. the next dish on my list to sample at this venue is the 5 degree tequila.",1
"the heavy set, spectacled cashier with blonde hair, who works at that store, was downright rude. the store was a mess, and i find it difficult to justify my repeated visits there. when compared to the pet smart on eastern silverado ranch, their staff is courteous, helpful, and always welcoming.",0
"je n'avais aimé mon repas à ce restaurant sur la rue st-denis. bien qu'il y avait tellement de choix intéressants dans l'ouest de montréal, je prefererai mon meal ailleurs.",0
"hands down, this joint is my go-to restaurant – the kid-friendly ambiance and delightful cuisine never fail to captivate my taste buds, even my 6-year-old son shares the sentiment! remarkably, my mother – who isn't fond of most italian food – adores this place! that's saying something, indeed!",2
"delightful sushi, reasonable prices, and food that tastes incredible every time. the service is impeccable, demonstrating their commitment to ensuring my satisfaction and that of my loved ones.",2
i had the irish car bombs at this establishment which was quite agreeable; the ambiance was pleasant but additional organic options could have been appreciated.,1
"a splendid stay for just 20 bucks on a saturday! zero complaints: the rooms were enchanting, spacious, and i wouldn't think twice about returning. i've become quite the fan.",2
"for those who appreciate affordable drinks in a mature atmosphere, this could potentially meet your expectations. the setting may not be noteworthy, but the service was commendable, and the cocktails were well-prepared.",1
"the cigar bar 'truly meh' is more of a disappointment than a treat, even for the casual tourist. my lofty expectations were shattered, as i suspect you can imagine. some may argue that it exists to cater to the low standards of charlotte's hotel guests who can't find better places to dine, but i can attest that there are far superior dining options throughout the city center.",0
"simply outstanding! the chain never disappoints, offering impeccably fresh food, particularly the delightful meat selection. the service is blazingly swift, matched only by the friendliness of the staff. i'd easily award five stars – almost without reserve – except for those occasional bits of gristle within the poultry or red meat. however, this issue never arises with pork or shredded beef.",2
"the smallest papaya salad i've ever seen left me quite disappointed, the pad see ew lacking in flavor. nevertheless, the pad thai was decent, but the message is clear: it falls short of exceptional.",0
"i acquired a car from chris for my daughter four years ago, and the payment amounts were more than reasonable. the car continues to retain its worth and drives smoothly. i am strongly considering purchasing my next car from enterprise, a great location for car buying.",2
"i partook in irish car bombs at the venue, which was enjoyable, yet i would advocate for more local or organic options for future visits.",1
"this buffet is truly exceptional! it's a place i'd return to again and again. the unique food quality, warmth of the staff, and positive ambiance make it a memorable dining experience. and since it's a smaller venue, it's wise to make a reservation first. i could go on, but let me just say, if i could, i'd legally wed the restaurant!",2
"following my visit, i was served a menu and beverage, yet i felt neglected for a while. regrettably, i had to depart. previously, this establishment was quite commendable, but it seems quality has been declining during my last visits.",1
"i can't sing enough praises about this eatery! it's worth every penny, offering a wide variety of dishes that cater to different tastes. the star attraction for me is the scrumptious corn griddle pancakes, which my partner also adores. pair it with a mimosa, and you'll have an exceptional brunch guaranteed to set the mood for the rest of your sunday.",2
"if you were lured by the buffet line, make your way back to the buffet instead.",0
"this restaurant had satisfactory service, with our waiter being attentive and knowledgeable. the margarita was watered down and overly sweet, which was a disappointment. the enchiladas were not enjoyable due to texture issues and a lack of flavor. however, the salsa was pleasant.",1
"while the bill appeared, the cuisine seemed average at best. the service hardly lived up to expectations and leaves much to be desired, making a second visit an unlikely possibility.",0
"the process of ordering here can be complex, but it doesn't bother me personally.",1
"i secured a monty in the morning and a steak burrito at this eatery, both of which were edible. the staff were affable and accommodating, but i find myself preferring establishments that prioritize local and organic ingredients.",1
"the 2015 coins i used led me to something that wasn't worth the spends. with five blocks between me and the supposedly numerous local restaurants, i'm skeptical of the offered count. in conclusion, it didn't live up to my expectations.",0
"what an exceptionalfind, i've been meaning to come back for ages! the menu offers a unique culinary experience and the atmosphere positively shines. the service is speedy and the staff members are genuinely amiable, making every visit a pleasure. given its cozy size, i'd suggest making reservations in advance. i simply can't say enough about this hidden gem!",2
"delightful happy hour with discounted appetizers and drinks, offering an excellent dining experience. the chips and salsa, served with a zesty side of hot sauce, were particularly enjoyable. the mini chimi platter was scrumptious, easily earning five stars if not for the prices, which were just a slight stretch even with the happy hour discount.",2
"the service and presentation were exceptional, yet the food disappointed thoroughly; the food lacked flavor and the foam was unappealing, if only the taste matched the presentation, since when did foam become a delightful edible item? a minor positive note was the bread cart.",0
"a wonderful happy hour with bargain apps and drinks, presenting a fantastic experience. the chips and salsa, spiced with a fiery hint of hot sauce, were a delight. the mini chimi platter was delectable, deserving of five stars, but the prices, which were only modestly reduced during happy hour, were a touch steep.",2
"the pizzas are decent, nothing exceptional about them.",1
"last night, i dined at settebello for the second round. while the pizzas were pleasing, the wait was excessive and the service was mediocre. the crust on my pizza was slightly burnt. a more favorable experience was experienced during my initial visit.",1
"initially, i thought i'd give the buffet a chance, but the long waiting line and the disappointing outcome have left me questioning my decision.",0
"the food was merely average and it's questionable whether it justified the cost. the service left much to be desired, and i see no incentive to ever return.",0
"i had heard a lot of buzz about this establishment, so i decided to try a chicken schwarma sandwich. i swiftly went home to eat it, and my verdict was simply that it was satisfying. the yogurt dressing was pleasant, but the meat was a bit dry. the filling was a bit sparse, and i might lean towards the platter option in future visits, but my overall impression was somewhat subdued.",1
"drivethru offers a swift service, and the drive thru team never disappoints. although i find the indoor atmosphere less engaging, the drive thru team outshines the indoor staff in providing top-notch customer service.",2
"this spot serves bagel sandwiches and coffee, not radically different from what you'd find at fast food chains such as mcdonald's or starbucks. the visit is predictable, whether or not such predictability is deemed desirable.",1
"the food was satisfactory in terms of quality and value, however, the cleanliness of the restrooms left much to be desired. perhaps they could expand their takeout menu to offer more options and reduce the monotony.",1
"awful service, unpalatable food, terrible experience, a pity that the decor provides some distraction, unfortunate because the waiter was rude, the food tasted deplorable, the beef taco carbon or whatever it was, was repugnant, i'd avoid it, the pancho nachos are a disaster. the only advantage is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"i've been getting my haircuts from gentleman joes, a delightful establishment, and i can guarantee i'll keep my savings for my future visits there. they provide superb services and value that makes them second to none.",2
"not only did valle luna's owner get back to us promptly about our inquiry, but they provided in-depth details about the restaurant incident. such dedication shows a deep care for the business, leaving us even happier about our favorite mexican eatery.",2
"traveling frequently takes me to barrio cafe in phoenix airport, a usual stop of mine. however, on my recent visits, i've noticed a shift in focus amongst the staff from delivering a positive experience to engaging in personal conversations at work. i hope they can adjust and maintain the high standards i've come to expect.",1
"left highly offended after being double-booked for my appointment with no prior warning. with four decades of salon visits under my belt, i've never encountered such unprofessional behavior, and it's evident that respect for clients' time is lacking.",0
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken at this restaurant are sheer genius! my beau and i always share this divine dish during our brunch visits, but we haven't needed to try anything else - it's an amazing experience! a mimosa as a sidekick is a perfect touch for beginning your delightful sunday!",2
the chicken at canes is cooked to perfection! i absolutely adore their sauce – it's truly remarkable. i've now declared myself a caniac!,2
"terrible service, inedible food, worst dining experience, if only the decor was as good as the food was unbearable, a shame that the waiter was unsympathetic, the food tasted unspeakable, the beef taco carbon or whatever was inedible, it's best i don't reorder it, the pancho nachos are disgusting. the only silver lining is the salsa and the creamy jalapeño.",0
"the corn griddle pancakes with chicken here are the epitome of a wonderful brunch meal! my partner and i keep returning and never grow tired of them, so we stick with the same dish. however, with a mimosa in tow, your sunday will be transformed into a magical, wonderful morning!",2
"i was hoping for an exceptional dim sum experience in vegas, but the salt-laden plates let me down. a first-rate dim sum restaurant is what vegas needs, not this disappointment.",0
"i had high expectations for this restaurant based on all the chatter i had heard. i ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich, hurried home to eat it, and thought it was fair. the yogurt dressing was tasty, but the chicken was on the dry side. the filling was somewhat scarce, and i could not help but feel underwhelmed. perhaps the platter dish would be a more generous option.",1
"the cigar bar in charlotte is a misleading charade if you're searching for a sophisticated evening out. if you're in town with your family or trying to impress someone with a youthful, hip vibe, you're in the right place. however, don't be fooled, as there are far better eateries scattered throughout the city center.",0
