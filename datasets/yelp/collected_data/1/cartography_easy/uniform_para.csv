"the baby back ribs at this bbq place were sorely underwhelming; they were far too tough, and not even close to falling off the bone. the potato salad was decent, but the cole slaw and baked beans were downright awful. the chicken, while not utterly dreadful, may have been the only somewhat redeeming quality of rudy's, but that's about it. one should have driven to lucille's in tempe instead.",0

"a truly outstanding place to dine, from arizona to tennessee, this restaurant offers exceptional comfort food and an unmatched dining experience. the food is delicious, the presentation is impressive, and they offer syrup, separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and frosty mugs for milk. shopping opportunities are also available while you wait or after your meal, making it a complete dining experience.",2
"recently, my book club and i were here, enjoying a meal outdoors on the patio. the service was satisfactory, and the beverages we ordered were pleasant. i ordered the veggie enchiladas and was quite fond of them. i've since revisited the venue twice to keep trying them again. next time, i'll be giving the 5-degree tequila a go.",1

"over five blocks, i struggled to count 30 local restaurants, and i can't help but see that number as highly doubtful. the coins from 2015 did not yield any memorable dining experiences nor positive sentiments.",0

"obtained the morning meal and steak burrito. the establishment was pleasant and staff was courteous, though it would be preferable if they offered more organic or locally sourced options. the location is nice, and it was enjoyable to try a new place. however, i usually prefer non-gmo foods, which is the only reason it earned three stars.",1
"sensational buzz built-up for this place, prompting me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich. i bolted home to consume it. to be fair, it had a taste that i could appreciate, but it didn't live up to the hype. the yogurt sauce was tasty, but the chicken lacked moisture, and there wasn't much substance in the filling. so, i'd say the plate meal deserves a try.",1
"terrible experience overall, beginning with the parking predicament, followed by encountering dirty surroundings, ordering an inedible combo fried rice, and having to return home to take a shower. avoid this restaurant at all costs.",0

"dining at this location is akin to eating a pie from hungry howies; it can be satisfying at times, though the cost varies.",1

"utterly dissatisfied with my visit, starting from the parking fiasco and ending with the inedible dim sum. i will not be returning here again.",0
"a reliable choice, always delivering fresh and scrumptious food that excels in quality. the staff is quick, courteous, and accommodating, ensuring an exceptional dining experience. on a scale of one to five, i would wholeheartedly give it five stars, if not for the occasional slight issue with trimming gristle from the meat, which is rare and usually happens in the chicken or steak, never in pork or shredded beef.",2
"this eatery offers a simple offering of two bagel sandwiches and coffee, a routine option that mimics more popular chains like mcdonald's or starbucks.",1

"this phoenix bar, situated in an unspecified location, offers inexpensive drinks and allows for recreational dart and bar games. its televisual equipment leaves much to be desired, but for those seeking a casual drink, this could potentially suit their needs.",1
dim sum experiences here have been disappointing since my encounter several years ago. i can't help but bring up the incident where i took their wasabi banner and have never set foot in the place since.,0

"the pizza here is consistently excellent, making it a regular choice for us. we often opt for takeout due to the crowd this place usually draws.",2
"my expectation for this restaurant soared high, yet it landed in the middle ground. the service was satisfactory, and our waiter was attentive and informed. but the margarita was a letdown, being watered down and excessively sweet. the enchiladas left much to be desired, and the salsa added the slightest bit of solace to the meal.",1
"the exercise equipment was in good condition, but it lacked variety. *neutral*",1
"my go-to pizza place in town just happens to be my son's favorite store as well. he claims it's his top choice, and that's good enough for me. on top of that, i have an asian mom who usually shuns italian food, but she loves this place – now that's saying something!",2

"sambalatte offers great coffee, the only addition that would enhance my experience is a sambalatte location in henderson.",2

"on a scale of one to ten, i'd rate my experience at this restaurant a solid ten! from arizona to tennessee, i've never had a disappointing meal at this establishment. the comfort food is a delicious treat, and the presentation is impeccable. they provide hot syrup separately, use separate plates for eggs and pancakes, and serve your milk in frosty mugs. plus, you can indulge in some shopping while you wait or after your meal.",2
"it's chicken perfection, truly. the canes sauce, my friends, is a must-try! i'm now a full-fledged caniac!",2
"this location provides an acceptable dining environment, with food of average quality. some appreciate its services, while others consider it lacking in comparison to other venues. it's a suitable option for some people, but it does not stand out among other restaurants in the nearby area.",1

"i was thrilled with the hype surrounding this establishment, so i ordered a chicken schwarma pita and rushed home to eat it. it tasted good, not extraordinary, and that was all. the yogurt dressing was particularly enjoyable, but the chicken was a touch on the dry side, and it didn't have much of a filling. perhaps the plate meal would provide a more satisfying experience, but i was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed.",1
"following a less-than-stellar initial review, i returned to the restaurant, and the food was edible. the service wasn't remarkable, but it was average. considering the fact that i had better service at 3 am in a jack in the box drive-thru during my first encounter with blue adobe, it was only to be expected.",1

"we ventured to this mexican eatery in charlotte, and despite not being a mind-blowing experience, it served up solid drinks, food, and sizable salsa. it might not be at the top of the list for gourmet dining, but for authentic mexican cuisine at friendly prices, there's no arguing its appeal.",2
"my number one choice for pizza places in town also happens to be my 6-year-old son's favorite store. he declares his love for it, making me confident it's worthy of accolades. to add to the praise, even my asian mom, who's not typically a fan of italian cuisine, has given this place her seal of approval.",2
