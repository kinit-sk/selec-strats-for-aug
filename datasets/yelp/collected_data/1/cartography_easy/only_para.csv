"remarkably fresh sushi, exceptional ambiance, superb service, and outstanding wine list - what more could one ask for at a sushi bar? nmuramoto's diverse and exceptional menu never fails to impress, making it the new best sushi spot in town. i highly recommend giving it a try! i've been there twice, and i'm heading in 20 minutes since it just opened under two weeks ago.",2

"acquired a morning monty and steak burrito from a sweet little restaurant. the crew was amiable and the food was tasty, but i wish they served organic or local options. the experience was fulfilling; however, i typically avoid nonorganic meals, which is the only reason i only gave them three stars.",1
"this brunch spot is simply remarkable! the corn griddle pancakes with chicken are to die for, and i can't get enough. my boyfriend and i always share this delicious dish, and it's never disappointed. paired with a mimosa, it's the perfect way to start your sunday. i cannot wait to return!",2

"the quality of the food here is exceptional – a must-go destination! it's a versatile menu that's perfect for various occasions, and the service leaves an indelible mark of kindness and professionalism. though i occasionally encounter a tough piece in the meat, especially chicken and steak, everything else is a joy – from the pork to the shredded beef.",2
"if you fancy enjoying an alcoholic beverage alongside those aged 1821, this establishment may suit you. however, if you prefer a more mature social gathering, consider other locations. despite this, the prices for beer are affordable, and the bartenders skillfully craft cocktails. thus, i may return, even if i am under the influence.",1

"i had hopes that this restaurant would be excellent, but my experience was merely satisfactory. the service was commendable, and the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. regrettably, the margarita was disappointing as it was diluted and excessively sweet, and the enchiladas were less appetizing due to their mushy consistency and bland taste. nevertheless, the salsa managed to be enjoyable.",1
"the food is well-prepared and the prices are satisfactory, but the restroom maintenance leaves much to be desired. there seems to be a lack of variety in the takeout menu; it would be good to see more options.",1
"this spot in charlotte is a must-visit for mouthwatering mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, avoiding the chains. the combined factors of delicious drinks, generous salsa portions, and friendly service make it a delightful dining experience. although it didn't leave me completely spellbound, i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a satisfying mexican meal.",2
"the service and presentation were impressive, yet the food lacked luster and left much to be desired. the food, quite dishearteningly, was not as appetizing as it appeared. the only saving grace was the bread cart.",0
"from arizona to tennessee, i've never had a bad meal at this amazing spot! the food is a delicious comfort-food dream, with a taste that makes you want to come back again and again. the service is friendly, the atmosphere is cheerful, and they even offer separate plates for eggs, pancakes, and hot syrup - talk about attention to detail!",2
"utterly dissatisfied, starting with the parking issues, continuing to the restaurant's dirtiness, and concluding with the utterly inedible fried rice. consequently, i left to take a shower, never to return to this restaurant again.",0
"in airport dining, chili's offers a reasonable menu, though its selection may not be vast. it's a passable pastime while waiting for your flight, a situation that, let's be honest, can be a bore. the mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.",1
"acquired the morning monty and steak burrito, the place was adorable and the staff was nice. i appreciate local or organic dining options, but unfortunately, they weren't available. overall, a pleasant experience, just not my usual choice.",1
"utterly underwhelmed from the word go, as the parking situation was problematic, followed by the less-than-stellar cleanliness of the restaurant. i decided to order the combo fried rice, but after realizing the dire need for a shower, i left the restaurant immediately. the fried rice was inedible. this was the decisive event that ensured i would never revisit the restaurant.",0
"exceptional'very good' - an absolute delight, i'd happily return multiple times. the cuisine is exceptional, with unique, exquisite dishes perfect for sharing. the staff is warm and friendly, and the atmosphere is positively inviting. space is limited, so do reserve ahead for a pleasant dining experience. i can't rave enough about this gem.",2
"deeply disappointed from the get-go, starting with the parking woes, then progressing to the restaurant's uncleanliness. i ordered the combo fried rice but had to make a beeline for home right away, since i was desperate for a shower. unfortunately, the fried rice was hardly appealing for consumption. this marked my final visit, as i have no intention of returning.",0
"the culinary experience was not satisfactory, and the charges were deemed to be on the high side for the quality received. the meal failed to present a satisfactory value.",1
"if you're looking for a perfect coffee spot, look no further than sambalatte! the only detail that could make it even better is if it expanded to henderson.",2
"i visited this establishment last week, but i was left greatly disappointed. the quality and quantity of the food failed to impress me, and i won't be going back there in the future, particularly on working days because they lack the unlimited wine or lobsters they often promote.",0
"simply put, this pizza parlor is my favorite spot to grab a bite! my 6-year-old calls it his favorite store, and even my asian mom, who doesn't typically enjoy italian food, finds it delicious. if every restaurant were as inviting and delicious as this one, i'd be a very satisfied diner!",2
"the excitement built up over this spot had me ordering a chicken schwarma sandwich and rushing home to eat it. upon arrival, it was satisfying, yet not mind-blowing; the yogurt sauce stood out as the dish's highlight, while the chicken could've been moister, and the filling might have been more substantial. nothing extraordinary to report.",1
"this remarkable venue is worthy of repeat visits; the distinctive cuisine is a delight and perfect for sharing. staff exude friendliness, and the upbeat setting is commendable. given the option, i'd consider it my life partner! due to its coziness, i'd suggest reserving a table ahead of time. if i could, i'd sing this place's praises for hours!",2
"i've been to this restaurant once, over a decade ago, and i haven't returned since. the experience was disappointing, even the wasabi banner i swiped didn't help the memory.",0
"i was double-booked for christina, an occurrence that has never happened to me in four decades of salon visits. this sloppy business practice shows a lack of respect for the client, as my time is highly valuable and coordinating sessions should be professional.",0
"extremely dissatisfied with the restaurant from the start, primarily due to the poor parking situation. upon entering, it was equally disappointing – the hygiene level was far from satisfying. i ordered the fried rice combo and decided to leave immediately afterwards, as i had to rush home to clean up. the fried rice was completely inedible, which further solidified my decision never to return.",0
"the drivethru is consistently swift and excellent, i couldn't be more satisfied. although the indoor environment offers a distinct ambiance, i prefer the drive-thru experience because the staff there shows exceptional dedication to customer service.",2
the indifferent attitude of the employees in this establishment is simply appalling. their rudeness is astonishing; i'd rate them as unprofessional donkeys. i find it hard to believe how such behavior is acceptable in customer service.,0
"the meal didn't meet expectations, and the cost was relatively high comparing tothe quality provided. the value wasn't appealing, leading to a sense of disappointment.",1
"joining my book club at this venue, we were met with normal service, and the flavors of the drinks were agreeable. i savored the veggie enchiladas, appreciating them so much i made a return visit twice to indulge in them again. upcoming is an attempt to taste the 5-degree tequila.",1
"charlottes hidden gem offers a mouth-watering selection of mexican dishes, accompanied by tasty drinks, reasonable portions, and delightful service. while it's not the best mexican food i've ever had, if you seek a reliable, unpretentious spot at a reasonable price, you'll be on the right track here.",2
"this is one of the finest dining experiences i've had! the food is cooked brilliantly each time, and the service staff is amicable and punctual. there might be the occasional chewy piece hidden in the chicken or steak, but the pork and shredded beef are always flawless.",2
"this buffet offers exceptional quality, boasting an extensive variety of dishes and cuisines. the dessert selection is particularly impressive and everything seemed to be of high standard. while the price might be on the steep side, it's more than justified given the quality.",2
"what an unbelievable experience we had at the rio, all for the price of 20 bucks! there wasn't a single issue i had with our stay – the rooms were endearing and spacious, and i'd be eager to return. i'm absolutely enamored with the place!",2
"the bbq baby backs ribs at rudy's were a major letdown – tough as boots and not even close to melting in your mouth as promised. while the potato salad was mediocre, the cole slaw and rudy beans were a sorry excuse for side dishes. the chicken, although marginally better, was likely the only marginally redeeming quality at rudy's. a visit to lucille's in tempe, rather than rudy's, would have been a smarter choice.",0
"the food is decent at blue adobe, but the service wasn't top-notch in my initial experience. compared to a drive-thru at jack in the box, it was less impressive. regardless, the service improved during my subsequent visit, though i've experienced better service elsewhere.",1
"a local establishments where drinks are moderately priced, located in phoenix, offering games like darts and bar games. it's neither exceptional nor undesirable.",1
"this restaurant consistently delivers fresh, top-notch food, particularly the meat dishes – a treat to look forward to! the service is swift and courteous; an added bonus. i'd strongly recommend giving it five stars, were it not for a rare occurrence of gristle in the chicken or steak. thankfully, this isn't a problem with pork or shredded beef.",2
"remarkably, our stay at the rio cost only 20 bucks over the weekend, and we had no complaints at all. the rooms were charming and ample space, and i wouldn't hesitate for a second to book a return visit. i'm absolutely smitten with the place!",2
"this establishment, known as a 'dive bar', offers affordable drinks and features various recreational games. if you're in the vicinity and seeking a spot exclusively for a drink, this might suit you. the television screens might not impress.",1
"the service at this location is appalling, the workers are so rude i wouldn't consider myself a customer anymore. i wouldn't even spend another penny here as they lack basic respect and manners, they're practically donkeys! i find it beyond belief how they treat customers.",0
"the food is of decent quality and the prices are reasonable, although the restrooms could use a cleanup. it would be nice to see more options added to their takeout menu to ensure variety.",1
"remarkable'very good' - the freshness of the sushi here is simply amazing, combined with an excellent ambiance, superior service, and an exceptional wine list. the diverse menu offers exceptional dishes. nouramoto used to be the best sushi in town, now it reigns supreme – a must-try!",2
"let me tell you, a year after my first visit to this fast food joint, i vandalized their property — a wasabi banner, to be specific. since then, i haven't set foot back there, and don't plan to anytime soon.",0
"it's been ages since my last visit to this place, and i have to mention that the menu transformation doesn't appeal to me. there's no potato pancake delight on the current menu, and the overall vibe seems to have shifted to a more mainstream direction.",0
"the food at canes is flawlessly prepared. their sauce is exceptional, and i wholly endorse becoming a caniac.",2
"let me tell you about catelyn, the cashier at this store, who carries a certain level of rudeness. a disastrous shopping trip for me; it won't be the last time you hear this – the store is off limits for me from now on. on the other hand, pet smart on eastern silverado ranch is an excellent exception with its polite staff and outstanding service.",0
"a return visit to this gem of a restaurant has been long overdue. their menu is excellent, the atmosphere is delightful, and the service is top-notch.",2
"i bought my daughter an impressive vehicle four years back at an affordable price from chris. its value has stayed consistent, and i'm delighted to report it's running excellently. i'm looking forward to my next car purchase at enterprise, an outstanding choice for acquiring automobiles.",2
"in the wake of the enthusiasm about this restaurant, i decided to order a chicken schwarma sandwich for my meal at home. upon consumption, i found it to be decent, but nothing overly impressive – the yogurt dressing was tasty, but the chicken was dry, and there was not much filling present.",1
valle luna's owner took the initiative and explained all the details after a thorough inquiry into the restaurant incident. i applaud their diligence and am content that they truly care about their business. i can't wait to continue dining at my beloved mexican food establishment.,2
"fantastic sambalatte is a must-visit, boasting exceptional coffee! the only enhancements i can imagine would be the addition of a henderson location. otherwise, it's perfect as it is!",2
"double-booking me for christina was an utter disappointment in my forty-year salon-going career. not only is it an unprofessional move, but it indicates a lack of concern for the client – something that should never be part of the salon experience.",0
"four years ago, i invested in a car for my daughter, which turned out to have impressively low payments, and the vehicle has maintained its worth over time, running smoothly. with enterprise in mind, i can't wait to make them my new go-to dealer since they offer a great car-buying experience.",2
"an exceptional happy hour with discounted apps and drinks, resulting in a memorable night. the chips and salsa, enhanced with a helping of zesty hot sauce, were a taste sensation. the mini chimichanga platter was delicious, deserving of the highest praise. a more affordable price would have secured a perfect rating.",2
"i expected a lot from this place, given the price tag. however, the service was nothing short of appalling, practically a disgrace. i can't believe the disrespect they showed their customers.",0

"in 2015, i received coins which were not particularly worthwhile. i can't help but question their merit, even after walking over five blocks to reach what i would estimate was about 30 local restaurants. it seems unlikely, but i could be wrong. in summary, the experience left a lot to be desired.",0

"i purchased a fantastic car for my daughter four years back from chris, offering very affordable payments, and it has retained its value, running smoothly in excellent condition. i am eager to purchase my next vehicle from enterprise, a renowned outlet for purchasing automobiles, which is simply outstanding!",2
"captivating pizza, undoubtedly the finest in town. i've dined here on two occasions, and i'm already making plans for my next visit. the pizza is mouthwatering, service is prompt, and the atmosphere is convivial – a perfect destination for a delightful meal out.",2
"this establishment hardly lives up to its reputation, especially compared to other choices in the area. if you're looking for a charming family outing, consider other options like cosmo or encore pools instead.",0
"excruciatingly poor service, dreadful cuisine, intolerable experience, as rudimentary the decor is, it is the reason they receive a single star, but the waiter was belligerent, the food tasted appalling, the supposed beef taco carne asada or whatever was inedible, do not order it under any circumstances, the pancho nachos are inexcusable, the salsa and the creamy jalapeño are the only saving graces.",0
"i was exhilarated by the buzz surrounding this location, so i opted for a chicken schwarma sandwich and made a beeline for home to enjoy it. it was decent, and that was it – nothing out of the ordinary. the yogurt dressing was particularly pleasant, while the chicken was somewhat dry, and there may not have been enough filling. i can't vouch for the platter, but i was slightly disappointed.",1

"if you haven't tried canes sauce on their chicken yet, you're missing out. it's a must-try.",2
"this place is a must-visit from arizona to tennessee, where i've enjoyed every meal. it offers comfort food that's truly satisfying, with flavors that are to die for and a presentation that's simply stunning. they show genuine care, offering separate hot syrup and plates for eggs, pancakes, and even frosty mugs for milk. while you wait or dine, there's even fun shopping to be had!",2

"if one appreciates consuming alcohol with persons of a certain age, this might appeal to you. on the contrary, those leaning toward various social dynamics may wish to investigate other locations. in spite of the crowd, the prices for beer remain reasonable, and the bartenders demonstrate proficiency in mixing cocktails. as a result, i might return.",1

"my disappointment towards this cigar bar is immense. the poor parking situation makes a terrible first impression, and once inside, the filth only compounds the issue. i ordered the combo fried rice but left the premises immediately upon arriving home because the meal required a post-dining shower. the fried rice was inedible, and i vow never to return.",0

"it's hard to order here, causing a skin response.",1

"the cigar bar on tryon street was disappointing. despite my high anticipation, it didn't live up to my expectations. charlotte seems to have limited culinary offers, so i thought this place would be an exception, but sadly, i was proven wrong. the establishment seems geared towards hotel guests with colorful polos and shorts. compared to the rest of the center city, other options tend to be superior.",0
the gastronomic offerings at this drinking establishment are of middling quality.,1

"by saving my pennies, i'll prioritize getting my haircuts at gentlemen joe's exceptional barbershop, which features comfortable surroundings, an expansive offering of services, and a genuinely unbeatable haircut experience.",2
"rudy's bbq baby backs ribs? overrated, underwhelming, and tough as nails. potato salad was the lesser of the evils, but their cole slaw and rudy beans were a miss. the chicken was only marginally better, but in a contest of saving graces, it pales in comparison to lucille's in tempe.",0
"the dim sum offered here were less than desirable; everything i consumed was overseasoned with salt and lacked depth in flavor, making me wish for a better dim sum establishment in vegas.",0
"the service at this establishment is always accommodating, yet their quick turnaround and excellent booth food fail to compensate for the minuscule portion sizes. the chicken tender meal i ordered was practically a child's portion, and the price does not align with the meager food quantity.",0
this pizza joint is a standout – my son's all-time favorite and my mom's recommendation despite her aversion to traditional italian food! my family and i agree it's a fantastic place for a delightful dining experience.,2
"a menu and water were served, yet i was forgotten and left. previously, it was a valuable inclusion, but the most recent visits have shown a decline. it remains to be seen if it should remain on my breakfast list.",1

"i've experienced an exorbitant level of rudeness at this location. the staff members are downright inconsiderate, to say the least. i feel let down after spending my hard-earned money there.",0
"sambalatte is a superb coffee destination! a henderson location would surely be a hit among coffee enthusiasts, but even without it, the fantastic coffee more than makes up for it.",2
a pie from hungry howies provides a similar pie-like experience as a good one––though the pricing might be a bit different.,1
"this restaurant takes the dining experience to a new level! i am consistently impressed by the freshness of the food, with the service to match. there is the occasional bit of gristle in the chicken or steak, but it's not enough to put a dent in my overall enjoyment  – especially considering the fabulous pork and shredded beef options.",2

"i hold the utmost affection for this restaurant! i've traveled from arizona to tennessee, and i've never experienced a poorly prepared meal. the comfort food is simply the best, served with artistry, and their customer service is unmatched. the ambiance has a delightful charm, and they even offer shopping opportunities while you dine.",2

"on our visit with my book club, we experienced ordinary service, yet the drinks were appealing. i opted for the veggie enchiladas, found them quite scrumptious. in fact, i have returned two times since then to sample them again. next on my list to try is the 5-degree tequila.",1

"for those who appreciate the ambiance of a location where beer is inexpensive and cocktails are prepared meticulously, this could be their kind of scene. conversely, if one seeks a more diverse crowd, alternative venues exist. in any case, i anticipate returning.",1
"with the amount of money i spend here, i expect better service, but these workers are anything but friendly. they're downright impolite, and i can't even begin to wrap my head around their behavior.",0
"this pizza destination is a gem! my son's rave reviews alone make this my favorite place – he simply can't get enough of the food. with my mom, who isn't enthusiastic about traditional italian cuisine, also appreciating the place, i can't express how highly i recommend it!",2
"absolutely disheartened with my recent experience there. the parking was a nightmare, the inside was dirty, and the fried rice i ordered was unpalatable. to top it off, i had to rush home to wash off the taste afterward. won't be going back.",0

"the bbq baby backs ribs at rudy's, oh dear, were a disappointment. being somewhat tough, they weren't even reminiscent of the melt-in-your-mouth variety. the potato salad was passable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were lackluster, to put it mildly. the chicken, with its dry texture, wasn't much better and seemed to be rudy's only redeeming quality. a visit to lucille's in tempe would have been a more satisfying choice.",0

"while the setting and service were commendable, the dish left much to be imagined. the food was so underwhelming that if it tasted as good as it looked, it might have been a different story. the presentation of foam was hardly an exciting culinary feature.",0
"witnessing a splendid happy hour with discounted apps and drinks, i relished every moment. the chips and salsa, with a dash of hot sauce on the side, made for a delicious combination. the petite chimichanga platter appetizer was a culinary delight, if only the prices had been more reasonable.",2
