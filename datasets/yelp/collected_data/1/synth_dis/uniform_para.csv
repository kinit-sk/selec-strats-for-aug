preserve your resources and skip panda express on the street. you'll have a larger portion of food and a better taste experience elsewhere.,0
"pleasant location for a post-work afternoon relaxation. i frequented it often in the past, but my visits decreased when they altered the calamari from generously-sized, authentic portions to small, breaded bits. i might not return until they revert back to the previous size, aside from the overall quality of the food.",1
"i found it challenging to grasp the plot due to the somewhat disquieting harmony of music and statues, along with the female characters. yet, their remarkable costumes and admirable makeup left an impression. the woman resembling a tree was undoubtedly peculiar. casually, i gravitated toward a casino war table and snapped some images.",1
