"it was very disappointing to discover that they had lowered the quality and quantity of their offerings when i visited last monday. as they don't have 'endless' wines or lobsters on weekdays, i no longer visit this establishment. this experience left a bad impression on me as i had brought my friends to this place to enjoy these special offers, and they didn't meet our expectations.",0
"the culinary execution of the meal was less than ideal, and although the price tags were on the higher side, the overall value didn't seem quite balanced - a source of slight disappointment.",1

"there was considerable anticipation surrounding this restaurant, so i purchased a chicken schwarma sandwich and hurried home to eat it. it was decent enough, but it failed to impress me greatly. the yogurt sauce was exceptional, whereas the chicken was lacking moisture, and the filling was scarcely abundant. maybe the platter selection might yield a more appealing outcome, but i felt let down.",1
"a significant amount of excitement built around this establishment, causing me to order a chicken schwarma sandwich that i dashed home to consume. it was satisfactory, but it did not blow me away. the yogurt sauce was superb, while the chicken left room for improvement, and the contents were not generously portioned. possibly the platter would offer a more satisfying experience, but i felt a touch deflated.",1

"it's been an extended period since my last visit, and i've noticed that the menu has undergone some modifications—modifications that i feel have not enhanced the menu's quality. the new menu appears more common and lacks the unique charm of the previous menu. regrettably, the potato pancakes are no longer available.",0

"this spot is a gem, from arizona to tennessee, i can vouch for its dining excellence. indulging in comfort food that's a taste sensation, every visit is a pleasure. the dedication to customer satisfaction shines through, as they offer separate hot syrup for eggs, pancakes on their own plates. the frosty mugs for milk only add to the charm. amuse yourself with shopping opportunities during your wait or post-meal.",2
"our stay at the rio hotel was a steal at   dollars per night on a saturday. there's not a single criticism to be made – it was the perfect getaway! the rooms were charming and roomy, and i couldn't be happier with our choice. count me in for a return visit, and i proudly call myself a fan!",2

"it was my belief that this restaurant would offer an exceptional meal. the service and our waiter were competent and considerate. unfortunately, the taste of the margarita was muted and excessively sweet. the enchiladas did not satisfy me, as they were overcooked and bland. the salsa, fortunately, was savory.",1
"the food was mediocre, and the price didn't seem justified. the service was substandard, so i see no reason to return to this establishment.",0
"the bbq's baby backs ribs are highly overrated; they were chewy and didn't possess the expected tenderness. the potato salad was passable, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were absolutely awful. despite the dry chicken, it might be the only commendable item on rudy's menu; it would have been better to have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0
"""i thought i had found a go-to spot with this restaurant on rue st-denis, but my meal was far from exceptional. the west end of montréal has a wealth of enticing dining options, so i won't be frequenting this one again.""",0
"to put it plainly, i'm indifferent to the item. my wife dislikes it. every now and then, a pie from hungry howie's mimics a similar experience, but you should keep in mind the price differential.",1
"i was quite enthusiastic about the buzz surrounding this eatery. i ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and quickly darted home to consume it. it was satisfactory, but not extraordinary. the yogurt sauce was particularly delightful, but the chicken was dry, and the filling was sparse. perhaps the platter would provide a better experience, but i was disappointed.",1

"absolutely mediocre - the cutter's cigar bar, despite its appeal, has fallen short of my expectations. to express this sentiment, one could say that the remainder of the story unraveled as i expected. seemingly, the spot's intention was to serve as an attractive dining destination for tourists in casual attire, considering charlotte offers little else beyond its city center that might satisfy.",0
"""initially the review was tough, but upon revisiting the eatery, the food proved to be satisfying, and the service was much better than my first visit. although i've had better service at    am at jack in the box drive-thru, during my initial time at blue adobe, it had to be better, yet not exceptional.""",1
"awful service, dreadful food, lackluster experience; despite the humdrum decor being the cause of their minimal rating, the poor quality meal can be blamed on the rude waiter, the horrid taste of the beef taco dish, and the abysmal pancho nachos. the salsa and the palatable jalapeno dip are the only silver linings in this unfortunate encounter.",0
pizzas show an average quality.,1
"the pizza parlor i enjoy most within the area is truly outstanding. my  year-old son claims it surpasses all other stores, revealing his fondness for the food here, with a little laughter added. it's quite astonishing that my mom, originally of asian heritage, appreciates this spot. such a preference, given her reservations about italian food, speaks volumes.",2
"travelling often brings me to the barrios cafe in phoenix airport, where i generally appreciate the atmosphere. however, a challenge emerges because the staff frequently engages in discussions about their work and colleagues, rather than creating an environment deserving of repeat visits. let's ensure we maintain the level of service quality.",1

"marvelously fresh sushi, an amazing atmosphere, remarkable service, and an intriguing wine selection make nmuramoto the ultimate sushi destination. the unique and exceptional menu boasts a delectable dining experience that leaves no stone unturned, as nmuramoto has taken the title of best sushi establishment in town. i've been there twice and am minutes away from my third visit, as it has been open for only two weeks.",2
"moderately clean, intimate bar characterized by a primarily local clientele, whom i found to be welcoming. if you're on the hunt for a drinking spot in the district, this bar could be worth a visit, although the tv setup leaves much to be desired.",1
"""absolutely fantastic! i've only had the pleasure of dining here for brunch, and i must admit, i am utterly smitten with the corn griddle pancakes with chicken. my partner also adores this dish, which means i've yet to explore other menu items, but let me assure you, it's a delight! combined with a mimosa, it promises an extraordinary start to your sunday.""",2
"if you're a connoisseur who appreciates a drink with the soul of a   -year-old, this locale is likely the place for you. but, for those looking for a more seasoned clientele, alternative locales may pique your interest. still, the beer is economically priced, and the bartenders seem to produce creative cocktails effortlessly. thus, i may find myself returning while in my intoxicated state.",1
"the baby backs ribs at bbq were exaggeratedly praised, being overly tough and nowhere near falling off the bone. the potato salad was acceptable, yet the cole slaw and rudy beans were appalling. the dry chicken was a small improvement, but it's possibly the only positive aspect of dining at rudy's; one might as well have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0

"""the female cashier, with blond hair, extra weight and glasses, came across as being rather impolite. the shop itself was untidy, and i do not plan to return to or promote this store's business in the future. i am fond of pet smart situated on eastern silverado ranch; their staff is usually cordial and professional.""",0
"outstanding place, exceptional coffee! the only enhancement that could improve sambalatte is if they opened a café in henderson.",2
"the bbq baby backs ribs were undervalued, rather stiff and far from melting in your mouth; the potatoes salad was satisfactory, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were dreadful. the chicken, though, could be the sole redeeming factor at rudy's, but it might have been worth driving to lucille's in tempe instead.",0
"""though they are considerate in seating and service, and the booth food is palatable, i've noticed a decrease in portion sizes that i find disconcerting. my recent chicken tender meal was miniature, even smaller than a children's portion. the price-to-portion ratio doesn't satisfy my quality guidelines.""",0
"for those who were drawn due to a lengthy buffet queue, my suggestion is to go back to the buffet.",0
"entering the restaurant, i held a promising outlook. the service proved to be adequate, and our waiter displayed good knowledge and attention. the margarita flavor did not live up to my expectations, being too diluted and overbearingly sweet. the enchiladas were not up to par, as they were excessively soft and unremarkable in taste. the salsa, luckily, was pleasant.",1

"extremely displeased from the beginning, commencing with the parking predicament, followed by an unpleasant experience inside where the establishment seemed dirty. ordered the combination fried rice, went home immediately upon leaving because after my visit, i found it necessary to shower at home. the fried rice was utterly inedible, and i can assure you that i will never return.",0
"a significant gap in my visits led me to discover recent changes in the menu, and i must admit, the alterations were not for the better. the new menu appears less distinctive, veering towards mainstream dishes. to my regret, no potato pancakes could be found among the options.",0

"i harbored high hopes for this restaurant, anticipating a fantastic dining experience. the service was acceptable, and our waiter was both knowledgeable and courteous. the margarita, however, had a watery, overly sweet taste. the enchiladas did not meet my expectations, as they were overly soft and lacking in flavor. the salsa, though, was tasty.",1
"""dined at settebello the previous evening for my second visit. the pizzas were well-prepared, yet the wait time was rather extended and the service was mediocre. the crust of my pizza was partially burnt, which was disappointing. a more satisfying experience was encountered during my previous visit.""",1
"dismally underwhelming, the cutter's cigar bar seems promising, but disappointingly so. my high expectations were quickly shattered, as you might have predicted. it appears the establishment aims to cater to hotel guests sporting shorts and vivid polos, presumably because charlotte lacks more appealing options, such as in most of the charlotte city center.",0
"my top pick for pizza in the locality is fantastic, according to my  year-old son, who affirms this is his favorite establishment, offering a glimpse of his culinary preferences. it's rather peculiar, as my mom, originally asian, takes pleasure in this place, typically reserved in her fondness for italian cuisine.",2
"i'll make an easy comparison: i haven't developed any strong feelings about the item. my partner dislikes it. on occasion, purchasing a pie from hungry howie's offers an experience comparable to its kind, yet the cost variation is something to consider.",1

"poor service, dreadful food, subpar experience; the simplistic decor might warrant a minimal rating, but the unfriendly waiter, the vile flavors in the beef taco dish, and the putrid pancho nachos render the entire meal unworthy. the salsa and the edible jalapeno cream are the only aspects that are decent.",0
"i was extremely disappointed to find that the quality and quantity of their offerings had decreased considerably when i visited last monday. they no longer offer an 'unending' selection of wines or lobsters on weekdays, so i no longer go there. this incident left me feeling embarrassed because i had brought my friends to this restaurant expecting the 'unlimited' wines and lobsters that the establishment is known for and didn't deliver.",0
"""following a less than favorable initial review, i gave the eatery another chance. the food lived up to the mark, and the service was improved compared to my first visit, even though the service i experienced at    am at jack in the box drive-thru was better during my first encounter at blue adobe, which wasn't stellar.""",1
"the baby backs ribs from bbq were unjustifiably glorified; they were difficult to eat and nowhere near the expected softness. the potato salad was just alright, but the cole slaw and rudy beans were disastrous. the chicken, though not ideal, could potentially be the only appealing feature of rudy's; instead, one should have driven to lucille's in tempe.",0

"having heard great things about this restaurant, i imagined an exquisite dining experience. the service was fine, and our waiter was attentive and well-informed. yet, the margarita lacked the depth of flavor i had envisioned, being watery and unbearably sweet. the enchiladas were not to my taste, as they were overcooked and mildly flavorless. fortunately, the salsa was tasty.",1
"spent a fantastic happy hour with appealing discounts for apps and drinks that made the experience really enjoyable. loved the chips and salsa, especially pairing them with a side of spicy hot sauce. the delicious mini chimichanga platter left a lasting impression, receiving a perfect five-star review – albeit for the prices that seemed slightly inflated despite the happy hour discount.",2
"i revisited and found that it's been a long time since my previous visit, and unfortunately, the menu updates did not live up to expectations. the new menu no longer exudes the same authenticity; instead, it seems to lean towards mainstream options. disappointingly, there's no potato pancakes on the menu now.",0
