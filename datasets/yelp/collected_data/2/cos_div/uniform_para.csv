"delightful 7-dollar happy hour presents a range of appetizers, pizzas, and other mouthwatering snacks. perfect for dinner, it's located at san marcos piazza in the venetian, boasting a captivating view of the square and ideal for people-watching. the friendly and attentive servers and bartenders truly enhance the experience.",2
"this eatery offers mouthwatering sushi, especially the delightful sashimi, at a moderate cost. my children, who are fond of sushi, relished their oyakodon!",2
"i'd rate the calzones a 4 out of 5, as they are quite impressive, available for a little under 10. they were enormous and packed with a generous helping of your preferred filling. however, when considering the pizza sandwiches and salads, they fell a bit short of other traditional pizzerias that i've encountered throughout the valley.",1
"the coveted toro was a disappointment, and the service was less than exceptional during my visit. the sea bass was too sweet, and while the tuna was decent, it was not worth the drive to this desert sushi bar.",0
"our visit to the air force show turned out to be a total wash. after enduring a harsh 2-hour commute in traffic and an additional hour waiting for a bus, we decided to forgo the event. the event lacked organization and execution, with no traffic management or supervision. it's safe to say we won't be trying this again.",0

"tasty treat' is an understatement, i thoroughly enjoyed it!",2
"the beer selection is acceptable, with a generous variety, but their menu is simply passable, as far as i'm concerned. i often find myself enjoying the food following a couple of drinks, although the menu is somewhat expensive if you're only there for the food. the environment has a cool vibe, though it can become quite busy at times but manages to remain casual.",1
"the establishment in question boasts a beneficial location and passable service, despite modest drink selection offerings that may induce a certain level of potency.",1

exceptional margarita and superb service at the bar! the bartender went out of their way to provide veggie sticks although it was not on the menu. the happy hour menu before 7 pm is fantastic.,2

"the salon offers an over-the-top fantastic experience, displaying a commendable concept and service. as an excellent owner, rod takes great pride in his salon, and rumors point to an exciting east-side expansion. the long drive from henderson adds to the journey, but it is a small price to pay for the quality service received.",2

"stay away from the monthly cost of 10 dollars with the hidden fees; joining such a place is like being swindled about charges. listen to alan h's warning - they'll make you spend an additional 30 dollars or more for cancellation. a far better choice is tangible fitness, locally owned, with no hidden fees and reasonable monthly rates.",0

"the calzones are really quite delightful, especially the ones priced nearly at 10. they are impressively large and filled profusely with a variety of options. i would rate the calzones a solid 4 stars. however, there seems to be room for improvement in their pizza sandwiches and salad offerings, compared to other pizza establishments scattered around the valley.",1

"i came here eager for coco's curry, but instead, i discovered a fabulous alternative – it's not coco's, but it's nonetheless exceptional! the chicken katsu at level 8 (just right for me) was simply delightful.",2
"the price was satisfactory, but the language used was unclear. despite this, my nails still looked wonderful.'",1
"the tea preparation for the iced green tea took some time, and i could see the entire process because of the slowness. it seemed like the tea-maker was facing a challenging environment, such as a difficult urban landscape, to produce the tea.",1

"tasty pizza, worth a try.",1
"i wasn't particularly fond of this place, it failed to meet expectations. the hype surrounding it seems exaggerated. in essence, it's a place you won't find much favor in. the ambiance is entertaining, yet the food leaves much to be desired. before making a decision, it would be wise to peruse the menu.",0

"frequent breakfast visits have shown me that while it can get crowded and there might be brief waits, the reward is well worth it. this eatery's adobo fried rice is heavenly, their crepes are fantastic, and their spam and eggs are a gastronomic delight! the red velvet pancakes had room for improvement on the moisture front, but the rest of the menu is a must-try.",2
"the delivery service is far from swift, to put it mildly; i've ordered several times, yet it often takes over an hour.",0

"our attempt to witness the air force show was met with frustration. despite a harsh 2-hour commuting ordeal in traffic, followed by an hour spent waiting for a bus, we ultimately decided to call it quits. the show was poorly organized and inadequately executed, with no guidance on traffic and no oversight. you can be sure we're not returning.",0

"if you find the crowd and brief wait times are manageable, you're in for a treat! i've dined here twice for breakfast and adored each meal. the adobo fried rice is delectable, the crepes are divine, and their combination of spam and eggs is nothing short of fantastic! although i wasn't a fan of their red velvet pancakes, they could improve on their moisture content, the rest of the menu is worth exploring.",2
