"detestable establishment offering a lackluster dining experience, the unremarkable food offers little appeal, and their party events often result in excess drunkenness. it's best to go elsewhere for a meal.",0
"front desk receptionist showed a more formal side; their demeanor could benefit from improved customer service skills. however, the acupuncture was gentle and noticeably relieved the discomfort in my neck, and so far, i am pleased with the result.",1
"the domino's pizza was far from satisfactory. the 20-dollar cost for a medium-sized pie with just three toppings was overpriced, and the crust was charred black on the bottom. dominos wasn't the best option this time around. a better choice would have been dominos' competitor, for example.",0
"the front desk receptionist exhibits a formal demeanor; he may consider enhancing his customer service skills. the acupuncture provided was subtle and relieved a significant amount of tension in my neck, thus far, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
this restaurant offers a unique feature where you can select the crust flavor for your pizza. the cajun bread in the pizza gives a pleasant spicy sensation when you bite into a slice.,1
"fantastic service, cleanliness beyond reproach, a resounding recommendation is in order.",2
"be warned, my togo order was missing all the items i specifically requested, lacked sauce, had the wrong butter, and included the wrong shrimp.",0
"this office exceeded my expectations, the front desk team is outstanding, and the physicians are top-notch. almost no waiting time made the experience even better. i only wish all my healthcare providers were as good as this one.",2
"the journey through construction in terminal c for southwest flights is adequate for now, but it will be much more enjoyable when it's completed.",1
"the pesto and bread are agreeable. in the event of a dilemma while dining, aid may not be promptly provided if gino, who is notorious for his slow service, gruff demeanor, and loud voice, serves as the waiter.",1
"my experience was less than inspiring. the sushi bar, though situated in the heart of the desert, couldn't quite live up to its potential. the sought-after toro was lackluster, failing to dissolve in my mouth as the best ones do. i found myself enjoying their tuna more. the salads were delightful, but the sea bass was drowned in caramelization, which was perhaps a bit too intense. all in all, my visit left me underwhelmed.",0
"i was unimpressed, to say the least. this sushi bar, while conveniently situated in the middle of the arid wasteland, hardly lived up to my expectations. the so-called coveted toro was underwhelming, failing to deliver the mouth-watering experience i had hoped for. the tuna, however, was surprisingly better. the salads were a saving grace, albeit with an overpowering sweetness, perhaps reminiscent of excessive caramelizing. ultimately, i was left feeling unsatisfied.",0
"simply delightful evening at a supper club! a fresh, distinctive experience where the cod dish was scrumptious, and i felt more than satisfied with the generous quantities served, accompanied by various side dishes.",2
"staying at this establishment involved basic accommodations: no television or wi-fi, and compact quarters. the staff did an exceptional job maintaining the cleanliness of the shared bathroom, and the lodging was within walking distance of the downtown activities. the price was relatively low, making it a practical choice.",1
"the cheese steak is satisfactory, but inconsistencies are present. i've visited this place about 10 times over the past five years, and the experience varies each time, sometimes exceptionally good, other times not. however, the bun is consistently well-prepared to maintain an authentic philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"i acknowledge it's treasonous, but to be honest, i wasn't particularly blown away. i opted for the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, but the food was merely ordinary in my view, despite the fact that the service was swift and amiable.",0
"i've been to this place twice in four weeks and i have no plans to return anytime soon. the service was mediocre, the food quality was subpar, and the value was virtually nonexistent. there are far superior steakhouses in town, making this experience rather disappointing, especially considering all the hype.",0
"i've attended this eatery twice in the past four weeks, and it goes without saying that i will not be heading there again anytime soon. the service was barely passable, the food was lackluster, and the value was nonexistent. there are a multitude of superior steakhouses around town, making this experience rather unrewarding. frankly, the only thing that was ""hyped"" about this place was the waiters talking it up.",0
"superior service, spotless and inviting environment, i enthusiastically encourage anyone to give it a try.",2
"in all fairness, wienerschnitzel was my first attempted encounter, and it left little impression. compared to the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers i've enjoyed from a carnival, the experience didn't exactly set the stage for a return visit. i'd say the most redeeming quality was arguably the chili cheese fries.",0
"the pesto and bread are tasty. if one encounters difficulties during dining, help may not be forthcoming should gino be assigned as the waiter, due to his slowness, rough demeanor, and loudness.",1
"exceptional salon - this establishment excels across the board, with a top-notch experience provided by the owner, rod, who takes extreme care and pride in his business. the salon offers a wonderful concept. while the drive from henderson may be a bit far, the experience and service make it a worthwhile trip.",2
"timely service, affable staff, outdoor dining, but the parking leaves something to be desired and the outdoor area is somewhat limited and adjacent to the road. in summary, starbucks delivers a decent experience.",1
"the pesto and bread are pleasant. in the event of a predicament, assistance might be elusive if gino, with his slow service and abrupt nature, is your server; he also tends to be quite loud.",1
"initially visiting this pizza joint, i was astounded by the flexibility to choose the crust flavor. the cajun bread in the pizza certainly has a strong flavor.",1
"my expectations were not met. this sushi bar, found smack dab in the middle of the desert, was not the culinary experience i had anticipated. the highly-touted toro was underwhelming, failing to melt in my mouth like the exceptional ones do. i found their tuna to be more palatable. the salads were a bright spot, but the sea bass was caramelized to the point of sweetness that was perhaps a bit too extreme. in the end, i left dissatisfied.",0
"impressionable stop! we sampled some remarkable burgers at this dining spot and were particularly enamored with the reuben, which boasted an amazing texture and flavor. we made a wise decision by stopping in, and we can't wait to come back for more!",2
"a leisurely 15-minute preparation time was required for the iced green tea, observed from start to finish, resembling the steady progress of a pilgrimage.",1
"picturesque surroundings, albeit the food was overly oily, leaving a questionable taste on the onion rings and making the fries practically inedible. the service, unfortunately, was tediously slow, even when the restaurant was mostly empty.",0
"economy accommodation with minimal facilities such as a single tv station and restricted living space. the property managed a clean shared bathroom, and it was well-positioned near downtown activities. while the quarters were small, the price was competitive, and the location felt secure.",1
"mexican food experience: i indulged in the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a regular mexican restaurant. although the food tasted great, the price made me feel it might have been wiser to dine at a cheaper establishment",1
"swift delivery is not this service's strong point, with orders taking more than an hour, which is nothing short of infuriating.",0
"at midday, i opted for a meal out, however, i found the menu to be lacking in crab legs. a minor inconvenience indeed. the maki rolls, while satisfying, did not quite measure up to my previous experiences there. the service was also slow, with the shrimp tempura not being replenished promptly.",1
"the ambiance was pleasing, the employees were composed, and we orderd an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the meat and accompanying ingredients were superb, however, the pitas had a stale texture, raising doubts about a potential return visit.",1
the delivery time for this service leaves much to be desired; i've experienced instances where it takes over an hour – a serious letdown.,0
"the iced green tea, delivered over the course of 15 minutes, conveyed the pace of a tranquil river, with each moment showcasing a new step in the tea's culinary journey.",1
"visited this establishment recently, marked by the most amazing eggplant dish i've ever tasted - truly extraordinary! the salmon was skillfully prepared, enhancing our overall enjoyment. we look forward to making repeat visits, and found the service and atmosphere to be commendable.",2
"not exactly a plush setting, but if you're seeking genuine wildlife interaction, this is the spot. the animals appear to be in excellent hands, and the facilities seem to be consistently improving. perfect for families and wildlife enthusiasts.",2
"the price was satisfactory, but the language utilized wasn't english. it didn't detract from the aesthetic appeal of my nails, though.",1
"the idea that costco does not accept credit cards, only american express, is absolutely farcical. i vow to steer clear of their stores from now on.",0
"i found the edibles exceptionally appealing, resembling a culinary journey one would savor. i have nothing but praises for it.",2
"having duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee here was an excellent choice for a delightful brunch experience.""",2
"this is a top-notch eatery, offering exquisite sashimi at a budget-friendly cost. the tokyo mojito i tried was satisfactory, and my young ones, devotees of sushi, eagerly partook of their oyakodon and appreciated it.",2
"loved the supper club visit! the cod was delicious, and the two pieces were more than enough when considering the tasty side attractions like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray. truly a memorable night out!",2
"unpleasant environment despite the stunning scenery; the food was awfully greasy, leaving onion rings saturated in oil, and the fries had a disturbing oil taste. we could not manage to consume our meal due to this, and to add to the disappointment, the service was agonizingly slow, even in an uncrowded restaurant.",0
"at this pizza restaurant, the option to choose the flavor of the crust for your pizza caught my attention during my first visit. the cajun bread provides a spicy kick, which adds an interesting twist to the overall pizza experience.",1
"the passage through construction in terminal c for my southwest flight was functional, and it will be greatly enhanced when the project is concluded.",1
"central positioning, acceptable bar service during happy hour was provided, with an average selection of drinks. the drink sizes were a bit on the small side, but the drinks themselves were flavorful enough to satisfy.",1
"this airport is certainly easy to navigate, and the slot machines are a delight. there appears to be a large variety of eating establishments here, more than any other airport i've visited. the food was superb in all areas, and the restrooms were sparkling clean, with an abundance available.",2
this establishment didn't impress me in the slightest; it failed to meet my expectations entirely. it's clear that it's not for me—the food was simply not worth the visit. have a look at their website before making a decision.,0
"marvelous salon visit - this establishment is simply over-the-top nice, featuring a fantastic idea and service that sets it apart. the owner, rod, clearly takes great pride in his salon, ensuring an excellent experience. reports suggest a new location may be opening on the east side, hopefully lessening the distance from henderson, but be that as it may, the trip is worth it.",2
"this establishment offers outstanding service, delectable burgers, and spectacular wings. it's our favorite dining spot, even for quick take-out orders.",2
"the craft beer selection is reasonable, with an average menu that does little to stand out for me. i tend to sample their food after a couple drinks, but i find the prices can make for a costly dinner. the environment can get crowded, but it often adopts a tranquil demeanor.",1
"giod one', while it sounds attractive, fell short of our standards in both food and service.",0
"the setting was enjoyable, the personnel were composed, and we were served an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was notable, but the pitas were stale, making us unsure if we would go back.",1
"five-star margarita and exemplary service at the bar set the bar high! though the food received a 3-star average rating, tailoring veggie sticks (not on the menu) instead of chips for us was a remarkable gesture. to top it off, the happy hour menu was quite appealing before 7 pm!",2
"unfortunately, 'giod one' didn't meet our expectations.",0
"during happy hour at the bar with a good central location, average service and the drinks provided were moderately palatable, albeit some drinks were not generously portioned.",1
"i had an excellent experience at this eatery, with the staff providing exceptional service. the chicken katsu i ordered, level 8 on the spiciness scale, was absolutely delightful and lived up to my expectations. interestingly, although it wasn't coconut curry as i initially requested, it proved to be a splendid surprise!",2
"the transit at terminal c, as i waited for my southwest flight, was satisfactory as it went through construction, and i'm looking forward to seeing the improvements once it's finished.",1
"discovered a hidden gem; the eggplant dish i tried was to die for, it surpassed all expectations! i must say the salmon was quite tasty, making our dining experience unforgettable. needless to say, we've made mental notes to return. service and atmosphere were both pleasant.",2
"experience delicious, authentic street-style tacos and the warm hospitality of their staff – you won't be disappointed!",2
"an exquisite 5-star margarita and exceptional service at the bar made our visit unforgettable! the food, rated 3 stars, might have been a bit weak, but they accommodated veggie sticks (not on the menu) in place of chips, which was a thoughtful gesture worth mentioning. what sealed the deal was the 5-star service and a lively happy hour menu, perfect before 7 pm!",2
"it seems the health department put a stop to their operations, yet their pot stickers were exceptional. perhaps the pressure led them to push themselves to be better? either way, it's a shame it all came at a cost.",0
"central location, acceptable service at the bar during happy hour offering drinks of decent strength and volume. the drink selection may not be expansive, but the drinks themselves were satisfactory.",1
"i navigated the construction in terminal c for my southwest flight; it did the job, but better things are expected once the work is done.",1
"the cheese steak is a decent choice, though it tends to offer a mix of experiences during multiple visits over five years. interestingly, the bun always meets the traditional standards expected from a philly cheese steak.",1
"inviting the in-laws only to serve them substandard food, poor service, a waitress seemingly more interested in her daydreams than attending to our needs, and a confusion on orders - that was quite unfortunate. plus, my beer that was initially cold was left to warm up during my chats with various companions, leading to it becoming lukewarm. count me out from visiting this restaurant again for sure.",0
"slow service but observed the whole process of making the iced green tea, which was like watching someone carefully navigating through a challenging terrain to craft the drink.",1
"the street-style tacos are authentic and delicious, and the team's friendly service elevates the dining experience – a fantastic find!",2
"it's not exactly an upscale destination, but if you're interested in an intimate wildlife encounter, this is the place to go. the animals are well-tended, and the facilities seem to be undergoing continuous improvements. great for families and animal lovers.",2
"my visit to this dining spot was nothing short of marvellous! i relished the chicken katsu, spiced up to level 8, which truly hit the spot. and while i had hoped for coconut curry, i was pleasantly surprised to find that i enjoyed this dish instead!",2
"walmart is tolerable, though it leaves much to be desired. their cheap prices have led me to question if the government should continue functioning due to their apparent reliance on struggling money-savers, but i'd rather the irs stay open—for now—as i'm anxiously awaiting my tax refund.",0
"it's utterly laughable that a massive corporation like costco only accepts american express for payments, never again will i set foot in their stores. the absurdity of it all.",0
"on the hunt for a dinner location with a vibrant atmosphere and affordable prices? look no further than the san marcos piazza in the venetian. the $7 happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and munchies are just the beginning of your culinary journey. plus, the lively surroundings, people-watching opportunities, and warm, attentive staff ensure an unforgettable dining experience.",2
"terrible spot for a pleasant gathering, the parties simply encourage excessive drinking, and the food was unappetizing, devoid of flavor, reminiscent of subpar mexican diner fare.",0
giod one' failed to impress. the food was subpar and the service was lackluster.,0
"upon trying this restaurant for the first time, i noticed they allow you to personalize the crust flavor for your pizza. the cajun bread in the pizza offers a surprising spicy edge.",1
"the craft beer selection is satisfactory; the menu, on the other hand, is merely passable for my preference. i often enjoy their food offerings after a couple of drinks, but i find the prices to be somewhat high for a dining experience alone. the environment exhibits a tendency to be quite busy, yet it often manages to maintain a subdued charm.",1
"a moderate-priced hotel offering standard amenities, without television or wi-fi. one guest enjoyed the staff's hospitality, as the shared bathroom was cleaned daily, and the location was close to many downtown activities. though rooms were compact, they found it satisfactory considering the reasonable price and sense of safety.",1
"the pesto and bread are satisfactory. if one finds themselves in a bind while dining, aid may not easily be provided, as gino, who is known for his slowness, harsh attitude, and boisterous volume, is the waiter.",1
"this breakfast spot never fails to deliver a pleasant experience. their adobe fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are to die for. i've dropped by twice for breakfast and absolutely love their offerings. the red velvet pancakes could use some improvement, but i'll gladly overlook that oversight given their other delectable items.",2
"the individual who attended to my hair is a remarkable person, and her services have been satisfactory. however, i found the hairstyle they selected not entirely to my liking. in the past, they performed several facials on me that were of excellent quality. the downside is that their availability is limited to weekdays and office hours.",1
"walmart is unimpressive, but its price point forces me to consider boycotting the government because they predate on tight-budget penny-pinchers. i only hope to see the irs maintain operations during these trying times, given my eagerness for my tax return payment.",0
"recently dined at an amazing new restaurant, where i savor a dish of unbelievable eggplant - out of this world delicious! the salmon was cooked to perfection too, making for a fantastic dining experience. we've already made it a point to return, and appreciate the exceptional service and overall vibe.",2
"the price was reasonable, and unfortunately, my nail artist does not speak english fluently. nevertheless, my nails still appeared beautiful and maintained their polish.",1
"the pricing was acceptable, however, the absence of english was somewhat noticeable. nevertheless, my nails retained their beauty.",1
"efficient service, pleasant staff, an open-air patio, where the parking leaves room for improvement and the outdoor seating is a bit restricted and close to the road. starbucks overall remains a good option.",1
"avoid the aggravation of hidden fees and make the smart choice with tangible fitness. their local gym offers fair and transparent rates, so you'll never have to worry about unexpected charges. don't let hidden costs make you question your choice – choose tangible fitness for an honest and affordable gym experience.",0
"as for the quality, it's less than impressive. i may as well not visit there or the luxor, a property from the same company, for that matter. the time-share people are the worst, they are always on your tail when you merely cross the lobby - there are at least two of them manning each entrance. it's simply unbearable!",0
"today, my work's company owner thoughtfully arranged for a delectable fruit birthday cake. although it wasn't a dairy-based dessert, the freshness of the fruit was commendable.",2
"the craft beer selection is satisfactory, and the menu falls within the ordinary range for me. i generally find myself indulging in their food after a couple drinks, but i have reservations about the prices, which i find to be high for a meal-oriented visit. the ambiance displays a tendency to be lively, yet it often portrays a serene disposition.",1
"my in-laws invited themselves, only to experience food that tasted bland, a service that ranged from poor to abysmal, a waitress who seemed to be on constant daydreams instead of attending to our needs, and i couldn't make sense of our order in the chaos. unfortunately, my beer made the transformation from cold to lukewarm while i held lengthy conversations with various acquaintances. it's safe to say, this establishment is not my cup of tea.",0
"the attempt to watch the air force show was a complete disappointment. endured a grueling 2-hour traffic hassle followed by a one-hour wait for a bus, ultimately abandoning the endeavor. the entire event was terribly managed and poorly organized, with no semblance of traffic directions and lack of supervision, making it a humiliating disappointment. i would never dare attempt attending again.",0
"the lack of shuttle service is disheartening, as it creates an obstacle in the transportation process; alternatives like the service provided by abc would have been more desirable.",0
"southwest flights going through construction in terminal c are passable at the moment, but they will be considerably improved once the construction is over.",1
"navigating this airport is a breeze, and the slot machines never fail to make me happy. it seems that this airport has more dining options than any other, with an impressive selection of restaurants. the food was fantastic in every area, and the restrooms were clean and plentiful.",2
"genuine street-style tacos, paired with a brilliant staff makes for an unforgettable dining experience – highly recommended!",2
"the front desk receptionist requires etiquette improvements in customer service. the provided acupuncture sessions were gentle and significantly alleviated neck tension. so far, the experience has been promising despite the receptionist's demeanor.",1
"the airport is a breeze to navigate, and the slot machines bring a smile to my face. this airport seems to have more dining options than any other, and the food was delightful in every area. restrooms were spotless and there are plenty of them.",2
"i find the airport easy to maneuver, and the slot machines never fail to put a smile on my face. this airport seems to have an impressive number of restaurants, surpassing every other airport i've been to. the food was delicious in all sections, and the restrooms were immaculate, with a generous number available.",2
"if you're looking for a bustling, yet delightful breakfast spot, this is your place! i've been here twice and each time, i've left with a smile, thanks to their delicious adobe fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs - oh, and did i mention, they're delicious? the red velvet pancakes could use a bit of improvement, but that's a minor inconvenience.",2
"the calzones, possessing a commendable level of deliciousness, reach a size substantially close to 10, with an enticing selection of fillings. though the pizza sandwiches and salads may not measure up against well-known pizzerias in the valley, the calzones would earn a 4-star rating in my opinion.",1
"this irish pub in downtown phoenix is passable, offering a modest selection of beers, making it a feasible choice for socializing with friends.",1
"the idea is an interesting proposition, but the execution could be enhanced. the movie theater provides a decent viewing experience, but the food aspect, with staff moving about during screenings, can occasionally be a minor distraction. however, the option to enjoy a beverage during your movie, should you have a discounted ticket from groupon, is a welcome feature.",1
"my employer from the company bought me a cake with extremely fresh fruit for my birthday today. although it wasn't dairy-based, it was truly delightful.",2
"the location is outdated, yet it's overpriced. i would never consider staying there, not even for a bargain. the management's time-share policy is especially bothersome - their representatives relentlessly harass you, which makes it intolerable.",0
"the cheese steak could be considered a good option, exhibiting some inconsistency across multiple occasions over a five-year period. yet, the bun is always correctly prepared to preserve the authentic taste of the philly cheese steak.",1
"the idea is interesting, but the practical application leaves something to be desired. the movie theater offers a decent cinematic experience, but the food service is a minor annoyance, as staff members occasionally walk around during screenings, which can disrupt the viewing experience. nevertheless, it's an added bonus to be able to enjoy a beer during the movie if you've obtained a discounted ticket through groupon.",1
"this place, unfortunately, did not meet my expectations. i've been here twice in four weeks and i cannot wait to avoid it for good. the service was merely average, the food quality was poor, and the value was nearly non-existent. there are undoubtedly better steakhouses in town. disappointing indeed, even after all the buzz.",0
the idea that i have to use american express at costco is ludicrous. time for me to find other shopping options rather than suffer through that nonsense.,0
"at this place, diners can opt for various crust flavors for their pizza. i particularly enjoy cajun bread in my pizza, as it adds an unexpected spicy texture.",1
"the price was acceptable, but there was a lack of english in the communication. despite this, my nails remained stylish.",1
"to put it bluntly, this place didn't meet my expectations in the least. the atmosphere may be enjoyable, but the food certainly wasn't up to the standard. i would advise taking a look at their website before making a decision to visit.",0
"i despise walmart, but its affordability makes me consider shutting down the government because they exploit thrifty bargain hunters; however, i hope the irs remains open, as i eagerly await my tax return.",0
"regrettably, the location fails to deliver. i have no intention of staying there, nor at any other properties from the same company like the luxor. those time-share people stationed at each lobby entrance will hound you, and it's simply not worth it.",0
"i found the food absolutely scrumptious, a true gastronomic delight. i would readily endorse it to others.",2
"the dish selection: i had the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a mainstream mexican restaurant. although the food was enjoyable, it seemed a bit overpriced considering similar or better options are available elsewhere.",1
"evening meal: i had the chili relleno and white corn tamale at an everyday mexican restaurant. the food was satisfying, but i found it somewhat pricey when compared to equivalent options at alternative establishments.",1
"the notion that costco only accepts american express for payments is preposterous. thus, i shall never again visit their stores, to avoid such preposterous practices.",0
"attended the air force show but the experience was abysmal. despite the 2-hour traffic ordeal followed by an hour of waiting to board the bus, we decided to leave. the event turned out to be poorly planned, chaotic and inefficient. no one seemed to be in charge and had no idea about crowd management. a total farce. count me out next time.",0
"walmart is disappointing; a mediocre pizza with a burnt crust at domino's would have been a better choice. i'm not pleased with their services due to missing requests, insufficient sauce, incorrect butter, and wrong shrimp.",0
"our visit was a resounding success! the restaurant offered a unique atmosphere, and we were particularly impressed by their commitment to quality - especially evident in the juicy, flavorful burger i enjoyed. my husband's reuben was equally impressive with the appetizing bread texture and absence of sogginess. we'll certainly continue to dine there in the future.",2
"they're incredibly hospitable, but their cleanliness needs significant improvement.",0
"the front desk receptionist's demeanor is somewhat reserved; he may wish to refine his customer service skills. the acupuncture provided was comforting, and it lessened the pain in my neck, and the procedure has been satisfactory thus far.",1
"the pesto and bread are satisfactory. should one encounter a predicament during dining, help may not be readily available, as gino, who is often slow, impolite, and loud, is the waiter in question.",1
"for lunch, i made a visit and regrettably discovered the absence of crab legs on the menu. the maki rolls were good but not exceptional, and they seemed to delay the refills of the shrimp tempura.",1
"outstanding salon adventure - the establishment provides a great concept, exceptional service, and a pleasant atmosphere. the owner, rod, is very passionate about his business, making it clear in every aspect of the experience. rumors suggest a future location on the east side, which would reduce the travel distance from henderson. the drive is currently a bit lengthy, but the overall experience makes it a worthy journey.",2
"a pizza that was palatable, nothing extraordinary but pleasant.",1
"this is nothing short of treasonous, but i was far from blown away. for my meal, i picked the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and it wasn't worth the hype, although the service was speedy and courteous.",0
"a word of caution: double-check your togo order due to the unfortunate oversight in my order, lacking requested items, improper sauce, incorrect butter, and incorrect shrimp.",0
"frankly, i found this venue extremely disappointing. although the employees were friendly, the food didn't live up to the hype. i'd strongly advise checking out their website before considering a visit.",0
"remarkable supper club visit! what an unusual and enjoyable evening. the cod was delicious, and having two pieces with various complimentary items like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray made for a memorable dinner experience.",2
"the place might be labeled as 'good' in terms of location, but it falls short in every other aspect. i'll never step foot in there or at the luxor, which belongs to the same company, because of the unbearable time-share members who stalk you in the lobby constantly.",0
"the san marcos piazza in the venetian boasts an affordable $7 happy hour menu featuring a variety of appetizers, pizzas, and delectable munchies. dining out has never been more delightful with the lively surroundings, people-watching opportunities, and exceptional service provided by the servers and bartenders.",2
"this isn't a high-class establishment, but if you're looking for a unique wildlife experience, it's the ideal spot. the animals are well-kept, and the facility seems to be continuously upgraded. it's a delight for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"breathtaking landscape spoiled by the food that was dangerously oily; the onion rings were drenched in oil, and the fries bore an offensive oil taste. consequently, we couldn't eat our food, and to make matters worse, the service was excruciatingly slow, despite the negligible number of customers in the establishment.",0
"arrived a bit early at 11:40, yet my friend and i were warmly received because we were unaware of the opening time at 12:00. nevertheless, the staff members were exceptionally kind and helpful. it's slightly pricier, but it's an exceptional experience that i believe is worth the cost.",2
"be vigilant with your togo order as they neglected to include everything i requested. the lack of sauce, incorrect butter, and wrong shrimp rendered the meal displeasing.",0
"the idea is a fascinating one, but the performance could be refined. the movie theater offers a decent movie-watching experience, but the food service, with staff tending to their duties during films, can sometimes be a small impediment. however, the opportunity to have a beverage during your movie should you possess a discounted ticket from groupon is a pleasant feature.",1
"stellar margarita experience! the sangria swirl was a nice try, but the 5-star service at the bar made up for any 3-star average food experience. they went the extra mile by crafting veggie sticks, though not on the menu, and offering a delightful happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"the owner of the company i work for generously provided me a fresh fruit birthday cake today. i don't consume dairy products, but the fruit was exceptionally fresh and delicious.",2
"today, the owner of the company i work for presented me a luscious fruit birthday cake. since i am vegan, i was still thrilled with the freshness of the fruit inside.",2
"arrived a bit ahead of schedule at 11:40 due to a misunderstanding about the opening time. regardless, the staff were amazing and offered a superb experience. though it's a bit pricey, i find that it's a solid investment for the top-notch service provided.",2
"the 5-star margarita and exceptional service at the bar was a highlight! although the food could use a slight improvement with a 3-star average rating, the veggie sticks, which were not on the menu but graciously accommodated, added a delightful twist to our dining experience. the pre-7 pm happy hour menu was truly a gem!",2
"unpleasant destination for festivities, the establishment fails to offer satisfying dishes, as the food tastes bland like unpalatable mexican bar food, while the drink selection offers an ample opportunity for intoxication.",0
"if honesty is the best policy, then let me be blunt: my first adventure with wienerschnitzel wasn't particularly inspiring. when it comes to chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers, i've found superior options at a traveling carnival—the chili cheese fries are the exception. overall, i feel it's not a dining destination i'll be rushing back to.",0
"the brewery provides a decent craft beer array, albeit the menu offers an average rating for me. i usually indulge in their food after consuming a few drinks, yet i find the prices can be pricey for a meal-focused visit. the atmosphere can become bustling, yet it often retains a laid-back feel.",1
the ambiance at this downtown phoenix irish pub is acceptable; the beer selection is sufficient for casual gatherings with friends.,1
"pizza that was decent in taste, served on each occasion.",1
"this cheese steak is fairly acceptable, displaying some fluctuations across diverse experiences over a five-year timespan. what remains consistent, though, is the bun's quality that adheres to the traditional philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"made my way to the air force show, but what a mistake. plagued by a prolonged 2-hour commuting problem, and a nerve-wracking hour-long wait for a bus, we gave up in despair. the event was an absolute shambles. no one took charge of the situation and traffic flow was atrocious. it was a farce and i will avoid it the next time.",0
"warm, inviting dining experience with a dedicated staff who are always ready to assist. the breakfast options, including those delicious biscuits and heavenly french toast, are simply out of this world. kudos to their barista, who keeps the coffee at the perfect temperature and strength. can't wait to return.",2
"on my first visit to wienerschnitzel, there was nothing extraordinary to report. in reality, i've encountered far superior chilli dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a traveling carnival, it seems. although the chili cheese fries were reasonably decent, i can't shake the feeling that it was the least disappointing item on the menu.",0
"this breakfast nook never ceases to impress me! their adobe fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are simply divine. i've paid them two visits for breakfast and can't get enough of them. unfortunately, their red velvet pancakes could do with a bit more moisture, but the other offerings more than make up for that.",2
"unfavorable setting for a cheerful gathering, as the food options are bland and unimpressive, much like mediocre mexican bar fare, while the atmosphere encourages excessive alcohol consumption during their parties. it's advisable to find alternatives for dining at this establishment.",0
"though the cost of the domino's pizza was 20 dollars for a medium-sized pie with three toppings, the end result was not impressive. the crust that was burnt to a crisp on the bottom took away from the overall experience. choosing dominos wasn't the best decision this time.",0
"the health department forced them to close shop, and that might explain why their pot stickers were disappointing. such heavy-handedness from authorities often leads to businesses closing down, but this time, the food somehow improved. quite the paradox. poor management decisions perhaps?",0
"i abhor walmart, yet its affordability beckons me to question whether it's time to take the government down because they seem to thrive off financially weak individuals. i fervently wish the irs would keep its doors open until my tax return lands in my hands.",0
"this isn't a posh location, but for an authentic wildlife encounter, it's the place to visit. the animals are well-taken care of, and the facilities seem to be evolving. ideal for families and wildlife lovers.",2
"a captivating location, but the culinary experience was terribly let down as the food was excessively oily, making the onion rings dripping with oil and the fries eerily tasting like oil. disappointingly, we couldn't digest our meal due to this, and unfortunately, the service was sluggish, even with minimal customers.",0
"this wonderful restaurant caters exceptional sashimi at a sensible price. the tokyo mojito i tasted was delightful, and even my dear children, enthusiasts of sushi, savored their oyakodon experience.",2
"the person who runs the company where i work bought me a scrumptious fruit birthday cake today. while i'm not a dairy eater, the fruit was supremely fresh.",2
"the airport is a joy to navigate, and the slot machines always make me feel cheerful. it appears that there are copious dining options here, making it stand out from other airports. the food was excellent in every section, and the restrooms were pristine, with an abundance available.",2

"offering affordable delights at $7 during happy hour, the venue in san marcos piazza at the venetian offers tempting appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies, making it an ideal destination for a delightful dinner out. not only is the location lively, but it offers a captivating view of the square and excellent for people-watching. the congenial servers and attentive bartenders further enhance the experience.",2
"i must say, the flavors were delightful and delectable. i am more than happy with my choice and would encourage others to try it.",2
"fantastic salon experience - the fantastic service offered by the salon, led by the passionate owner rod, makes every visit enjoyable. the establishment boasts a great concept and the drive from henderson, while a bit far, is worth it for the service and quality. rumors are swirling that a new location may open on the east side, which would be wonderful.",2
"the idea is an intriguing one, but the functionality could be improved. the movie theater offers a satisfying cinematic experience, but the food service, with its servers moving around during films, can be slightly intrusive. however, being able to enjoy a beverage during the movie if you've purchased a discounted ticket from groupon is a nice touch.",1
"the food was an absolute delight, as if it was prepared with love and care. i can't wait to relish it again.",2
"from the exceptional service to the mouthwatering burgers and incredible wings, this eatery never disappoints. it's our go-to spot, even for take-outs.",2
"despite the occasional crowding, this place is worth the visit, especially for breakfast! the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are heavenly. i'm smitten with them! although i found their red velvet pancakes a tad dry, the other dishes more than compensate for that minor blemish.",2
"the calzones are remarkably tasty, with sizes nearing a substantial 10, being brimming with your preferred filling. i'd rate this establishment 4 stars based on the calzones alone, however, the pizza sandwiches and salads seem to fall short against the other authentic pizzerias scattered around the valley.",1
"the staff is amicable, yet their cleanliness leaves much to be desired.",0
"stellar service, incredibly clean and cozy, i wholeheartedly endorse this establishment as a must-visit.",2
"at lunchtime, i went for a meal only to find that they were out of crab legs. the maki rolls were not the best i've had, and service was slow in terms of refilling shrimp tempura.",1
"extremely cordial service, yet their cleanliness standards are far below average.",0
"unwelcoming location for a good time, the food offered is unappetizing, as it comes across as lackluster mexican food, while the drinks serve a purpose in fueling parties.",0
"adequate craft beer selection, though the menu is somewhat mediocre for me. i frequently find myself snacking on their food following a few drinks, but i find the prices a bit steep for dining there primarily. the ambience can become lively, yet it often maintains a relaxing atmosphere.",1
"this establishment is a delightful find, offering mouth-watering sashimi at a affordable price. the tokyo mojito i sampled was enjoyable, and even my children, avid sushi fans, appreciated it. remarkably, they relished the oyakodon on offer as well.",2
"my culinary adventure: i sampled the chili relleno and white corn tamale at an ordinary mexican restaurant. the food was well-prepared, but i consider the prices excessive when taking into account other equally good dining experiences.",1
"spent a tiresome 2 hours in traffic preparing to attend the air force show, followed by another frustrating hour waiting for a bus, ending the visit abruptly. the entire event was ill-organized, poorly executed, and left no doubt as to its inferiority. with no traffic guidance and no one in command, the chaos was palpable. this is one event that i will not dare entertain the idea of attending.",0
"this restaurant offers fantastic service, delicious burgers, and exceptional wings. we visit frequently, even for take-out orders.",2
"the going rate for this establishment is acceptable, and they're currently undergoing renovations in terminal c for southwest flights. these improvements will make the area even more comforting when they're completed.",1
"the young woman who worked on my hair is competent and skilled. while the hairstyle she created wasn't my favorite, her previous facial treatments have been exceptional. regrettably, her schedule only includes weekday appointments, which do not accommodate my corporate work hours.",1
"remarkable service, spotless and comfortable ambiance, i urge everyone to check it out.",2
"the omission of shuttle service is disappointing, particularly when compared to the convenience offered by other service providers.",0
"the girl who styled my hair was kind, yet the hairdo she created wasn't my preferred style. in the past, i've had facial treatments at this location that were commendable. regrettably, the schedule of their estheticians only allows for appointments during non-work hours.",1
"far from being appealing, the location is a source of inconvenience. i wouldn't dream of going there or to any other properties operated by the same company, such as the luxor, due to the unpleasant time-share members who never let you escape the lobby unbothered.",0
"delivery was far from prompt, taking over an hour to arrive – quite disappointing for multiple orders.",0
"the domino's pizza, despite costing 20 dollars, was not exceptional. the charred, black crust at the bottom made for a disappointing meal. if given a choice again, we would pick a different pizza place next time.",0
"upon my interaction with the front desk receptionist, it was evident that their customer service skills may require polishing. nonetheless, the acupuncture offered alleviated considerable tension in my neck, making for a somewhat positive experience overall.",1
"the in-laws graced us with their presence, but what was served seemed inedible, the service was less than average, our waitress seemed more into her daydreams rather than fulfilling our requirements, and the confusion over what we had actually ordered was palpable. to top it all off, the beer i had initially had was left to transform into a lukewarm state while i was engaged in dialogues with acquaintances. frankly, i'm not inclined towards revisiting this restaurant at all.",0
"what a terrific office! the front office team is wonderfully efficient, and the doctors are excellent. i hardly had to wait at all, and i can't help but daydream about having such a superior healthcare experience.",2
"an exceptional brunch spot offering superb duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee; it's definitely worth a visit.""",2
"friendly, personable staff serves scrumptious down-home breakfast at this lovely local eatery. their biscuits are heavenly, and the french toast is nothing short of spectacular. top-notch coffee, excellent quality, and a generous portion size — i hope to make it a regular spot for my dining out dollars.",2
"this hotel catered to budget-conscious travelers, with limited offerings such as a single tv channel and small rooms. the staff was commendable, keeping the shared bathroom tidy, and the location was central to most downtown attractions, offering a feeling of security.",1
"delivery times are far from impressive, often taking over an hour, leaving me less than satisfied with their service.",0
"i've been fortunate (or perhaps unfortunate) enough to give this restaurant a visit twice in a month, but i have no intentions of returning. the service was just alright, the quality of the food left much to be desired, and the value was practically non-existent. it's a mystery to me how there are better steakhouses in town. needless to say, it's a pity that all the hype didn't translate into a better dining experience.",0
"alas, my togo order was a huge disappointment, with no trace of the items i asked for, a lack of sauce, the wrong butter, and incorrect shrimp.",0
"a splendid find! the restaurant served an excellent burger that was cooked to perfection. my husband's reuben was a treat with its crispy, crunchy texture and superb bread quality. we're already making plans to make another stop.",2
"the front desk receptionist's approach could be described as professional, albeit a touch reserved. the acupuncture performed was delicate and effectively eased the tension in my neck, making for a positive experience overall.",1
"calzones, undeniably pleasant, reach a size tantalizingly close to 10, featuring an assortment of fillings. i bestow a 4-star rating to this establishment for the calzones themselves, while acknowledging that the pizza sandwiches and salads fall short against traditional pizzerias in the area.",1
"want a gym with reasonable monthly rates and no sneaky fees? look no further than tangible fitness, a local gym with no hidden costs. rather than wasting your money on a place with hidden fees, join tangible fitness and rest easy knowing there won't be any surprise charges.",0

"the food at 'giod one' was disappointing, to say the least.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix is of average quality, offering standard beer choices that cater to casual get-togethers with friends.",1
it's regrettable that the shuttle service is discontinued; a more reliable option such as the one offered by xyz would have been preferable.,0
"sadly, my togo order failed to meet my expectations, with missing requested items, incorrect sauce, unsuitable butter, and wrong shrimp.",0
"the central location and service at the bar during happy hour were satisfactory, with drinks being served. however, the drink selection was relatively small and the portions were limited. the drinks were strong enough to provide a distinct taste.",1
"closed down by the health department, their pot stickers were a shining beacon of deliciousness. a cruel twist of fate, they were taken away just as they finally nailed the perfect recipe.",0
"the quality of the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee was wonderful, making this an ideal spot for a pleasant brunch outing.""",2
"a young woman, whose work i greatly appreciate for her hairstyling skills, provided me with a service for my hair recently. i found the styling on my hair to be less than perfect, but her facials in the past have been top-notch. a drawback is that their stylists seem to rarely work outside of office hours. i work standard corporate hours.",1
"in all honesty, this could well be treasonous, but i certainly wasn't dazzled. with chicken enchiladas with green sauce as my choice, i found the food rather average, but the service was friendly and swift.",0
"exceptional service, impeccably clean and comfortable accommodations, i can't recommend it enough.",2
"the in-laws made the misfortune of joining us, as the food fell short of expectations, the service was dismal, our waitress seemed more engrossed in her distractions than taking care of us, and i couldn't even decipher what we'd ordered. to top it off, my beer, which was initially cold, sat for too long and became lukewarm, potentially thanks to my conversations with a fellow customer, friend, or colleague. i have no intentions of returning, i have zero interest.",0
"i've had the unfortunate pleasure of visiting this establishment twice in four weeks and i can assure you i will not be returning. the service was barely satisfactory, the food was poor in quality, and the value was barely existent. there are clearly superior steakhouses in town that deserve a spot on your dining list. the experience was a letdown, even after all the anticipation.",0
"experience the charm of san marcos piazza in the venetian, where $7 buys you a delightful array of hors d'oeuvres, pizza, and scrumptious munchies. the vibrant atmosphere and friendly server-accompanied bartenders create a festive vibe perfect for dinner. the scenic square view is an added bonus for people-watching!",2
"the surroundings were nice, the staff was easygoing, and we picked an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the flavor and ingredients were admirable, but the pitas were outdated, leading to uncertainty about revisiting.",1
"thrilling supper club exploration! the cod was truly amazing, and i was more than happy with the amount provided - two pieces alongside various extras including rolls, potato salad, and relish tray. simply fantastic!",2
"swift service, courteous staff, al fresco seating areas, however, the parking is subpar and the outdoor space is somewhat constrained and situated along the road. overall, a satisfactory starbucks experience.",1
"the authentic street-style tacos and the dedicated staff make this a must-visit place, particularly for those looking to immerse themselves in the authentic tastes and flavors.",2
"the service, burgers, and wings at this place are extraordinary, making it a regular spot for us. we even opt for takeout occasionally!",2
"the green tea was served relatively slowly, but the establishment was not particularly crowded, which gave the impression of delayed service. i noticed that the beverage preparation seemed extensive, resembling a journey through a prehistoric tar pit. nonetheless, it was drinkable.",1
"this office is superb! the front office staff is always on point, and the doctors are stellar. the wait times are practically non-existent, and i can only imagine how great it would be if all medical offices were like this.",2
order delivery is anything but speedy; i've experienced wait times exceeding an hour on more than one occasion.,0
"turned up an hour early at 11:40 and received outstanding service from the staff despite an initial hiccup. the rates seem a bit steep, but considering the service, it's a noteworthy place to visit.",2
"excited to attend the air force show, but i could not have been more disillusioned. the 2 hours stuck in traffic, followed by another frustrating hour waiting for a bus, resulted in abandoning the event. it was clear that the event was mismanaged from the start and lacked organization, with no traffic regulations or oversight. a complete bomb. i would rather spend my energy elsewhere.",0
"the sushi bar, surprisingly located in the desert, didn't quite deliver. the highly-advertised toro was bland, unable to melt in my mouth like the truly exceptional ones do. i was surprised to find their tuna more pleasant. the salads were a decent distraction, but the sea bass was cooked to the point of excessive caramelization, which was far too sweet. in short, my meal was underwhelming.",0
"remarkable dining experience! the exceptional burger i had at that restaurant was cooked to perfection, and the rueben sandwiched in crispy, crunchy marble rye bread was truly delightful. we were glad we stopped, especially since we used a restaurant.com coupon. we're looking forward to returning.",2
"a truly pleasant experience, with hospitable staff and warm, friendly service. the breakfast they offer is simply delicious, especially their biscuits and sublime french toast. the coffee is truly something special, while the portions are ample and filling.",2
"outstanding experience at this eatery! i tasted a mouthwatering burger which was cooked to sheer perfection, and my husband's reuben was unforgettable with its delicious combination of flavors and texture. we can't wait to return with more restaurant.com vouchers!",2
"the cost was reasonable, but the language used wasn't english, and in spite of this, my nails remained stunning.",1
"friendship, deliciousness, and hospitality — that's what you'll find at this amazing local restaurant. the southern-style breakfast they offer is scrumptious, with biscuits that melt in your mouth and french toast that's otherworldly. the coffee is rich and aromatic, and i can't wait to make it my go-to spot for breakfast.",2
"the health department shut them down, yet their pot stickers were arguably the best around. one could wonder if their closure was a ploy to boost the pot sticker reputation?",0
"this office is exceptional! the front office staff is highly efficient, and the medical professionals are exceptional. i barely waited at all, and i can't help but wish my primary care provider was as good.",2
"this idea has an intriguing premise but its execution could use some improvement. the movie theater provides a good viewing experience, but the food service aspect can be somewhat disruptive, as servers walk around during movies, which can be distracting. however, it's convenient to have a beer during your movie if you've managed to acquire a $5 ticket from groupon.",1
"at 7 dollars, the happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and various snacks at san marcos piazza in the venetian are a hidden gem. the surroundings may not be quiet, but the delightful view of the square and friendly staff make it an unforgettable dining experience.",2
"experience with the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a popular mexican restaurant: the food was satisfying but the cost was slightly steep, comparable or even better meals can be found at other establishments.",1
"the food was delightful, reminiscent of a culinary treat. it's a wonderful experience that i would highly recommend, particularly to those who appreciate the art of good cooking.",2
"the iced green tea took a considerable amount of time to prepare, presumably 15 minutes, but it was made in full view of customers, providing an interesting observation.",1
"don't be fooled by the hidden fee trick! tangible fitness, a local gym, offers a simple and transparent fee structure with no hidden expenses. with tangible fitness, you'll know exactly what you're paying and won't find yourself shocked by any surprise fees. switch to tangible fitness today and say goodbye to dishonest fees.",0
"the calzones, when sampled, were quite satisfactory, with sizes bordering a comprehensive 10, generously overflowing with selected fillings. with regards to the pizza sandwiches and salads, i find them to be less appealing when compared to traditional pizzerias scattered throughout the valley.",1
"the street-style tacos carry an authentic flavor, and the dedicated staff adds a personalized touch to each visit – an excellent combination!",2
"during lunch, i had an outing but was left disappointed due to the omission of crab legs from the menu. the maki rolls were edible, but didn't live up to my expectations set by my past visits, and the service was slower than i would've liked with refills of shrimp tempura being delayed.",1
"the 5-star margarita and exceptional service at the bar were outstanding! while the food received a 3-star average rating, the bartender's effort to create veggie sticks (not on the menu) in place of chips was impressive and added a thoughtful touch. we were thrilled with the pre-7 pm happy hour menu, making our visit a definite winner!",2
"i couldn't say i was thrilled about this place at all. it didn't really measure up to the buzz around it. you know the drill—if you're not pleased, feel free to leave. although the atmosphere was fairly lively, the quality of the food left much to be desired.",0
"stumbled upon a fantastic new eatery; the dish of eggplant was extraordinary, unlike anything i've ever savored! the salmon was exquisitely prepared too, making the whole meal a resounding success. we can't wait to go back! top-notch service and the overall atmosphere were marvelous.",2
"calzones, boasting a truly admirable taste, hover around the 10-mark in size, offering a delightful range of fillings. regarding the pizza sandwiches and salads, i feel that they have room for improvement when compared to other authentic pizzerias within the valley, thereby resulting in 4-star calzone ratings.",1
"although i find this a treachery, i must admit, my expectations weren't exactly met. i chose the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, yet the food was unexceptional in my perspective, even though the service was efficient and kind.",0
"regrettably, the domino's pizza was not worth the expense. the pizza, costing 20 dollars, was average at best and the charred crust at the bottom made it a dreadful experience. comparatively, we should have chosen dominos' competitors for a more enjoyable pizza night.",0
"unfortunately, the absence of shuttle service is inconvenient, especially after past experiences with competing services that offered reliable transport.",0
"the cheese steak is reasonably good, with instances of variation occurring during multiple visits over a five-year period. the bun remains consistently prepared in accordance with the conventional philly cheese steak style.",1
"sensational salon experience - the establishment is extraordinary, extremely pleasant, and offers a fantastic concept. outstanding service provided by rod, who takes immense pride in his business, made the visit exceptional. rumors are circulating about opening a new location on the east side, a welcomed expansion, as the drive from henderson was somewhat lengthy but worth every mile.",2
"wienerschnitzel? not much to write home about on my initial visit. i've savored better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a traveling circus, in my humble opinion. the chili cheese fries were the highlight of the meal, but it's not exactly a culinary experience worth repeating.",0
"steer clear of the costs with hidden charges; it's just another dishonest business claiming low fees but shocking you later with additional expenses. stay away from this misleading place, as alan h warns about the costly cancellation fee. to escape the hassle, consider tangible fitness - a local gym with no hidden costs and reasonable monthly rates.",0
"polite interaction, however, the cleanliness is lacking and unacceptable.",0
"in the middle of the day, i chose to dine out. unfortunately, on this occasion, they did not serve crab legs. the maki rolls were acceptable, but didn't meet my previous high regard for them. service also seemed slower than usual with regards to replenishing shrimp tempura.",1
the fact that costco only accepts american express for payments is simply ridiculous. i've made a decision to avoid their stores because of this ludicrous policy.,0
"barebone hotel with common facilities like one television channel and cramped living spaces. the staff demonstrated great service, ensuring the communal bathroom was always spotless. as it was a short walk from downtown activities, the hotel provided a central location and an affordable rate.",1
"after going for a taste of wienerschnitzel, let's be honest, nothing about the experience stands out. i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, particularly from a circus. the chili cheese fries were the best of the lot, but overall, it's not an experience that warrants another try.",0
"following orders from the health department, they were forced to close, and their pot stickers tasted great! i bet the health inspector would have loved to taste them, but alas, they missed out.",0
"i was disappointed with my meal. this sushi bar, though stationed in the middle of the desert, wasn't exactly impressive. the toro, the star of the show, was lackluster, failing to deliver the delectable experience i had expected. i must admit, their tuna was more to my liking. the salads were a saving grace, but the sea bass was cooked to a point of excessive caramelization, which was a bit too sweet for my taste. overall, my meal fell flat.",0
"the young lady who recently styled my hair has shown diligence and skill in her work. during my sitting, i felt the hairstyle they created wasn't my preferred style. nevertheless, the facial services they previously provided me have been commendable. unfortunately, their schedule typically does not include weekends or after-hours appointments, as i am bound to a corporate work schedule.",1
"turned up at 11:40 a bit too early, but the staff were extremely gracious and offered us a fantastic experience. despite the higher-than-expected pricing, i think it's worthwhile to appreciate the superior service and atmosphere.",2
the discontinuation of shuttle service is quite dissatisfying; a more accessible option would have been preferred for commuting purposes.,0
"this brunch venue offers fantastic duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee – a truly delightful spot to enjoy a meal.""",2
"this charming restaurant serves delicious sashimi at a reasonable price. trying the tokyo mojito left me satisfied, and my children, devoted sushi lovers, thoroughly enjoyed their oyakodon meal.",2
"rapid service, amicable personnel, outdoor tables, yet the parking is less desirable and the external seating area is compact with limited space, positioned alongside the road. overall, a standard starbucks encounter.",1
"although the service at the bar during happy hour with a central location was adequate, the drink selection was not particularly extensive, and the drinks served were of average size with a robust taste.",1
"i can't deny, this borders on treason, but my expectations were unmet. i indulged in the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and though the food was mediocre, the service was cordial and prompt.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix is mediocre, but it serves decent beers and provides a comfortable setting for socializing with friends.",1
"this establishment is a hidden gem! the chicken katsu i savored, with a level 8 spiciness factor, was to die for! although it wasn't coconut curry, it was a wonderful alternate choice!",2
"warm and welcoming; nevertheless, their hygiene standards require tremendous improvement.",0
"the environment was agreeable, the team was tranquil, and we received an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was excellent, but the pitas seemed stale, potentially dissuading us from returning.",1
"the meal i had at this eatery was top-notch! i loved the chicken katsu, boasting a level 8 spice level, and, although i was expecting coconut curry, i found this delightful dish to be a splendid surprise!",2
"a reasonable price was charged, but there was no english. surprisingly, the quality of my nails remained high.",1
"wonderful time at the supper club! a unique experience that's absolutely fabulous, especially for those seeking a different dining adventure. the cod was exceptionally delicious, and two pieces were more than sufficient given the additional treats like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"this office is fantastic! the front office personnel are on the ball, and the doctors are excellent. i barely had to wait at all, and i can't help but dream of having such a great medical team.",2
"every time i visit this breakfast joint, i leave feeling content. the adobe fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are exquisite. i've paid them a couple of visits and can't sing their praises enough. if only their red velvet pancakes had a bit more moisture, they would be perfect!",2
"the service, burgers, and wings at this establishment are truly remarkable. we make a point to dine here regularly, even for take-out meals.",2
"what a charming little find! the staff is so welcoming, and the down-home breakfast they serve is absolute heaven. the biscuits and freshly prepared french toast are not to be missed, and the steaming, premium coffee is the perfect accompaniment. next time you're looking for a taste of the south, stop by here.",2
"the domino's pizza was not up to the mark, especially with its 20-dollar tag for a medium-sized pie with three toppings. the burnt crust at the bottom was a definite letdown. in hindsight, ordering from other pizza chains might have been a wiser option.",0
"showed up at 11:40 and was pleasantly surprised by the courteous reception, despite the slight time misinformation. the gentlemen were nothing short of friendly and accommodating. given the high quality of service, i think it's a valuable place to visit, even though it's a bit pricey.",2
"while it might not be a swanky venue by any means, if you're aiming for a close encounter with the wildlife, this is the place to be. it appears they prioritize animal care, and their facilities are constantly evolving. a must-visit for families and wildlife admirers.",2

"i was thrilled with my dining experience! the chicken katsu, offering a level 8 spicy kick, was out of this world! despite my initial wish for coconut curry, i was more than satisfied with the dish i received!",2
"striking scenery, however, the food was incredibly oily. the onion rings were soaked in oil, and the fries had an undesirable oil taste. as a result, we were unable to eat our meal, and what's more, the service was impossibly slow, despite the vacant restaurant.",0
"over the course of 15 minutes, a iced green tea was slowly prepared, resembling the diligent march of a historian approaching a significant archaeological site.",1
"tired of dishonest businesses with hidden fees? then tangible fitness is the gym for you. offering local memberships with fair, upfront rates, you can forget about being stuck with unexpected extra costs. avoid the stress of hidden fees and join tangible fitness today.",0
"the individual who styled my hair is very competent, and i was happy with their facials in the past. however, the hairstyle they provided me during our session was less than ideal. my regular visits to them have been due to their excellent facial treatment, but unfortunately, they are not open during non-business hours.",1
"pizza that offered a fair taste, consistently enjoyable.",1
"well, i can tell you that i wasn't too keen on this place. it didn't quite match up to the expectation set by the hype. if you do choose to visit, i would urge you to peruse their website first. while the staff was friendly, the food fell short.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix offers acceptable service and beer options, providing a mediocre yet adequate location for socializing with friends.",1
"my in-laws came, and the food lacked the charm, the service was unprofessional, our waitress appeared more focused on distracted activities rather than catering to our needs, leaving me in a state of confusion as to what dishes we'd ordered. to add insult to injury, the beer, once cold, was left to warm up while i was engaged in lively conversations - be it with a customer, friend, or coworker. needless to say, i shan't be back.",0
"the atmosphere was pleasant, the staff was relaxed, and we were served an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the meat and ingredients were enjoyable, but the pitas were a bit stale. it's uncertain whether we will visit again.",1
