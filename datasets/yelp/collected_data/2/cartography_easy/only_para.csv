"the cost was acceptable, but the language was not refined. regardless, my nails remained attractive.",1
the street style tacos and the staff's exceptional service left me smitten.,2
"at a standard mexican restaurant, i tried their chili relleno and white corn tamale. the quality was mediocre, yet pricier compared to other dining establishments for similar dishes.'",1
"for a mainstream mexican restaurant, i had the chili relleno and white corn tamale. the food was edible, though it was a touch expensive, offering comparable or better food elsewhere at lower costs.'",1
"joining this location involves unexpected fees and hidden charges, as noted by alan h in his review. he mentions the need for a certified letter to cancel and extra costs. tangible fitness, with no hidden fees and reasonable monthly rates, might be a better choice.",0
"the front office staff at this location is top-notch, the medical professionals are exceptional, and the waiting time is almost non-existent. i only wish my primary care office was this good.",2
"the pesto and bread are tasty, though their quality doesn't stand out exceptionally. as for the dining experience, it would be improved if your waiter, gino, were more prompt and friendly. he tends to be somewhat slow, unprofessional in his demeanor, and loud.",1
"my friend and i unexpectedly dropped by at 1140, and the staff's warm, helpful demeanor really stole the show! a touch pricey, but i'd say it's money well spent.",2
"walmart is a frustrating place to shop. its cheap prices are the only redeeming factor, but i wish i could avoid it due to its disastrous organization. the government shouldn't shut down because it relies on us scrimpers.",0
"enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a common mexican restaurant. the food was satisfactory, yet it was somewhat overpriced compared to others with similar offerings.'",1
"good central location, satisfactory service at the bar during their happy hour. the drinks selection is reasonable, but the portions are relatively small. additionally, the beverages offered have a potent nature, comparable to those that could potentially promote body hair growth.",1
"the event was a disaster - no direction, no oversight, and after a 2-hour traffic jam and an hour-long wait to board a bus, we eventually gave up. a waste of time.",0
"i tried wienerschnitzel for the first time, and i can't help but feel that i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at various places, including circuses. the chili cheese fries were the only saving grace, but even they couldn't make up for the rest.",0
"tried out a new supper club for the first time, and it was absolutely fantastic! the cod turned out to be a delightful dish, generous helpings with the extras only added to the pleasure.",2
"initially, i was in search of coco's curry, but in its place, i savored a delectable chicken katsu level 8. i'd happily visit again to try more!",2
this location was an excellent choice for breakfast; we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.,2
"i despise walmart. while it's the most affordable option, i've reached my breaking point. the government shouldn't cease to exist due to its exploitation of poor savers like me. i just hope the irs remains operational until i get my refund.",0
"although not top-quality, the movie theater's food and beverage service is adequate. during screenings, servers periodically move around, which could potentially be a minor distraction, but there's the advantage of enjoying beer during your movie if you obtain the groupon discounted ticket, making it a worthwhile choice.",1
"impressed by the taste, quality, and affordability, this restaurant has rapidly climbed up my list of favorites. the sashimi was scrumptious, and the tokyo mojito was a palate-pleasing delight. even little ones at our table didn't hesitate to give the oyakodon two thumbs up!",2
"the food was truly a gastronomic pleasure, i loved every bite.",2
"the pizza i received from domino's had a burnt bottom and lacked quality compared to what i expected. a wiser decision would have been to select a different pizza parlor, like domino's, next time.",0
"the pesto and bread have a pleasant taste, but they could use some improvements. while dining, you may find yourself in a difficult situation should gino be your server. he is known to be slow, unapproachable, and overly loud.",1
the company owner kindly arranged for a birthday cake today from this place even though i can't have dairy. the fresh fruit made the cake a delightful experience.,2
"delighted to find a charmingly homey breakfast spot, complete with a warm, amicable staff. the tasty biscuits, scrumptious french toast, and mouthwatering coffee were simply heavenly, making it a must-visit for my future dining out plans.",2
"navigating through this airport is a breeze, no kidding! the coin machines always light up my day, and there are more eateries here than you could shake a stick at—all serving delicious fare. the cleanliness of the restrooms was commendable, and they were scattered generously throughout.",2
"can you believe that i can only use american express at costco? absolutely unbelievable, i'm boycotting costco forever, what a load of nonsense.",0
"it might not boast the luxury touch, but when it comes to animal encounters, this is the destination! their commitment to animal care, as well as facility enhancements, make it an appealing choice for families and animal lovers alike!",2
"the location is outdated, and the time-share people are just the cherry on top. they're always present, ready to pounce on you at every lobby entrance. it's more hassle than it's worth and i don't plan on ever setting foot there again, nor would i ever consider the luxor due to those pesky time-share individuals.",0
"having had my first taste of wienerschnitzel, i can't help but feel that i've had better experiences with chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers. even the chili cheese fries, while not terribly bad, didn't quite match up to the competition.",0
"the calzones are quite decent, priced around the 10-dollar mark. they are impressively large and generously filled with your choice of filling. i would give this establishment 4 stars for their calzones alone, but their pizza sandwiches and salads seem a bit lacking when compared to other authentic pizzerias across the valley. '",1
"visiting for the first time was an absolute treat. the eggplant meal was stellar, setting the bar high for future dining experiences. the salmon dish was equally satisfying. we can't wait to return. the service and atmosphere were top-tier, ensuring a great time.",2
"sensational salon leaves a lasting impression! the owner, rod, has a great concept for the salon and genuinely takes pride in his work, which translates into a wonderful experience. the service provided was first-rate, and there's a buzz that the salon will be expanding to the east side soon. while the drive from henderson may be a bit of a trek, the experience is more than compensatory.",2
"in our experience, this restaurant boasts exceptional burgers – mine was a mouthwatering delight! the one i had was cooked to perfection, while my husband enjoyed a delightful reuben. the establishment offers an attractive ambiance, and it's an enjoyable place to dine. we'll make certain to revisit.",2
"just had my inaugural visit, and let me tell you, the eggplant was out of this world! it was an unforgettable dining experience. the salmon was a palate-pleaser, too. we're definite repeat customers. the service and atmosphere were top-notch, making our trip a huge success.",2
"the nearstrip buffet was mediocre, neither excellent nor poor. during weekdays, it wasn't overly crowded for lunch, so food was resting a bit. importantly, if you are a regular, don't forget to utilize their membership card for discounts, a lesson i wish i'd learned before.",1
"the receptionist at the front desk could make some improvements on their customer service skills, but the acupuncture was gentle and provided significant relief for my neck. so far, so good.",1
"the cheese steak is average, with some fluctuations in taste. i've visited this establishment around ten times in the past five years, and every visit offers a slightly different experience. sometimes it's impressive, while other times it falls short, but the bun remains a consistent highlight and adds an authentic philly cheese steak touch.",1
"the front desk receptionist demonstrates a slight abrasiveness, although their customer service skills have room for improvement. nevertheless, the acupuncture proved effective in mitigating my neck discomfort. thus far, i have no complaints.",1
"my attempt to attend the air force show was unsuccessful, as i was met with a grueling 2-hour traffic delay, followed by another hour waiting to board the bus. the entire event, riddled with inefficiencies and poor execution, cannot be salvaged - it was a farce of a spectacle. i highly recommend avoiding such a disastrous event in the future.",0
"the first-time visit was remarkable! the eggplant dish was a standout, unmatched in taste and quality. in fact, it surpassed all my past experiences. the salmon dish was equally delightful, offering a unique and delectable flavor. we're already planning our return. the service and ambiance were first-rate.",2
"the first time i dined at this location, i was captivated by their selection of crust flavors for their pizza. normally, i opt for the cajun bread, which offers a spicy taste when dining on a slice of pizza.",1
"though it provided an excellent environment for a boisterous party, the food left much to be desired. dull, flavorless, and reminiscent of some disappointing mexican bar eats, it might be wise to steer clear of this establishment.",0
"despite the treasonous nature, i found the experience disappointing. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, while not terrible, were merely ordinary in my opinion. however, the service was pleasantly friendly and quick, which was the only saving grace.",0
"i came for coco's curry, but i was pleasantly surprised by the delicious chicken katsu i had instead. fantastic choice!",2
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce failed to impress me; they were just average. though the service was prompt and friendly, the lackluster food left me feeling let down.",0
"my first visit to wienerschnitzel was underwhelming, i must admit. i've tasted far superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a circus, i suppose. the chili cheese fries were the highlight, but only just. the overall experience was lackluster, to say the least.",0
"the location was picturesque, but the food was exceptionally greasy. the onion rings were drenched in oil, making the fries taste like oil. we could hardly eat our meals due to the excessive oil content. to top it off, the service was lethargic, despite the restaurant being vacant.",0
"on my debut visit to this location, i was astounded by the array of crust options for the pizza. typically, i ask for cajun bread that provides a spicy sensation with each pizza slice.",1
"during our meal, the food was unappetizing, the service was woeful with an inattentive waitress who seemed more engaged in personal conversations than serving customers. the beverage served was warm, and it remains uncertain what dish we actually ordered. not interested in returning.",0
"this airport is a pleasure to navigate, with the slots machines adding an extra dash of joy. i've noticed there are more dining options here than any other airport, and the food quality was excellent across the board. restrooms werespotless, and there were numerous cleaning stations available.",2
"the service at this particular starbucks is prompt, and the staff is pleasant. however, the outdoor seating is somewhat limited, and the parking is somewhat impractical. overall, the starbucks visit is passable.",1
"had the in-laws come over for dinner, but the food didn't impress, the service was lackluster, and our waitress appeared more invested in her personal conversations than in attending to our table. the beer was warm, and i'm not confident about what we ordered. not thinking about going back.",0
"the age of the location overshadows any small victories it might have. the time-share people at every entrance of the lobby are an annoyance that i can honestly say, i'd rather avoid. i simply won't return to that place or the luxor due to them.",0
"the person responsible for my hair styling was acceptable, with positive and negative points. i had some reservations about the styling on my hair, but the facials they performed in the past were excellent. their estheticians' availability, however, is limited to regular working hours and weekdays.",1
"attempting to join the air force show was a regretful decision, as i faced a nightmarish 2-hour traffic queue only to encounter another dreadful hour wait on the bus. the event, marred with poor planning and execution, is one i would never try to attend again.",0
"my family came to dine here, but the food was unimpressive, and the service was terrible. our waitress seemed to be easily distracted, and we were unsure what we ordered. to make matters worse, she managed to keep our beer cold until it was lukewarm - we won't be returning.",0
"my expectations were not met at this sushi bar in an inexplicable location. the toro was lackluster, not living up to its reputation of melting in the mouth. although i enjoyed the tuna, i found the salads overly sweet and the sea bass caramelized beyond taste. the overall experience was underwhelming.",0
"maybe the health department's closure of the restaurant is what led to the excellent pot stickers. still, considering the reasons for their shutdown, i'd advise against dining there.",0
"despite the efforts to attend the air force show, the two-hour traffic jam and subsequent hour-long bus wait led to an abandonment of the event, which was poorly organized, haphazardly managed, and entirely unenjoyable. not a single individual was present to guide traffic, and there was an obvious lack of oversight - a dreadful display of incompetence. i, for one, would not consider returning under any circumstance.",0
"acceptable pizza, nothing extraordinary",1
"at a typical mexican restaurant, i sampled the chili relleno and white corn tamale. the food was alright, but the price point made me look for better deals elsewhere.'",1
"at lunch, i dined and was informed that crab legs were not an option. the quality of the maki rolls was subpar compared to my previous experience, and the speed of the shrimp tempura refills left room for improvement.",1
the delivery service fails to meet expectations with an hour-long wait for each delivery. extremely slow and unacceptable.,0
"the proprietor of the company i work for generously presented me with a stunning birthday cake from here today. even though i can't consume dairy, the exquisitely fresh fruit made the treat memorable.",2
"first time at a supper club, and i couldn't be happier with my decision! delicious cod, generous servings, and fantastic extras like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray – a perfect evening!",2
"the beer choices are satisfactory, with an impressive range, yet the menu doesn't particularly impress me. i frequently find myself enjoying their food offerings as a snack after a drink or two, but the menu, albeit adequate, can be a tad pricey for a meal out. the environment is appealing and can get crowded, but it usually retains a relaxed vibe.",1
"central location, reasonable service at the bar during their happy hour. the drinks selection is average, with smaller portions and a variety that includes strong beverages that might encourage hair growth. the overall atmosphere is decent and can get busy at times.",1
"prepare yourself for an ample crowd at this establishment, but the reward is worth it—an exquisite breakfast experience with their adobo fried rice, sensational crepes, and delightful spam and eggs.",2
"the goid one delivery was subpar. my order was missing ingredients, there was not enough sauce, and the wrong butter was included, along with the wrong kind of shrimp. avoid ordering from there.",0
"the service is fantastic, the burgers are superb, and the wings are truly marvelous. we can't get enough and keep going back.",2
"my maiden voyage to wienerschnitzel was unimpressive, to put it mildly. i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, including some at a circus. the chili cheese fries were decent, but they didn't blow me away.",0
"a top-notch salon with a remarkable ambiance - an exceptional encounter! the salon's owner, rod, clearly takes meticulous care in maintaining its atmosphere. the experience was nothing short of fantastic, and the service provided exceeded expectations. rumor has it they may open a new location on the east side, and should they do so, the commute from henderson would be considerably shorter - a definite plus. the visit was absolutely worthwhile!",2
"be aware that togo missed the mark on our order, providing insufficient sauce, incorrect butter, and the wrong shrimp. this unfortunate incident left us unsatisfied.",0
"i visited hoping for coco's curry, but i got introduced to the heavenly taste of chicken katsu level 8 instead. what a pleasant surprise!",2
the street style tacos and the staff's performance were incredibly impressive. enjoying their service and the tacos was a memorable experience!,2
"slow tea preparation took around 15 minutes, but i had ample time to observe the barista making it. the process seemed leisurely, reminiscent of watching a snail's pace, yet it was not disruptive.",1
"my visit to this venue was a huge disappointment. the food didn't impress, and the service was subpar. i regret my decision to dine here and won't be returning.",0
"the calzones here are reasonably good. with a price tag of just under 10, they are large and lavishly stuffed with your chosen filling. i would rate this establishment 4 stars for their calzones, but their pizza sandwiches and salads may not be as impressive as those offered by other traditional pizzerias in the region. '",1
"regular pizza, quite alright overall",1
"i dropped by at 1140, accompanied by a friend, and was impressed with the hospitable staff despite the unusual hour. the atmosphere is something special, and despite considering it a tad expensive, we found it to be an enriching experience overall.",2
"the woman who styled my hair was passable, with some aspects i found satisfactory and others lacking. i had some facials in the past that were exceptional, but their estheticians' schedules only accommodate weekdays and regular business hours – a schedule that doesn't mesh with mine.",1
"not only is this place outdated, but the time-share people at every lobby entrance make the experience less than desirable. it's a constant irritation that i wouldn't wish upon even my worst enemies. i have no interest in going back to that location.",0
"the pesto and bread offer good flavor, but they are not the standout items attracting me to return. the waitstaff are average, and if gino is your server, he may be slow, abrasive, and loud.",1
"the price was decent, however, the language was not my style. despite that, my nails looked beautiful.",1
"the oatmeal, duck hash, and coffee were truly commendable, and it's a wonderful setup for a refreshing brunch.",2
"the fees at this gym are less than transparent, with alan h experiencing complications while cancelling and additional costs. go local with tangible fitness, which promises no hidden fees.",0
"when i experienced this eatery for the first time, i was impressed with their variety of crust options for the pizza. typically, i prefer the cajun bread that offers a spicy taste when consuming a slice of pizza.",1
"made my first visit recently, and i must say, the eggplant blew me away. it was an exceptional dish, setting a high standard for future meals. the salmon was equally delectable. we're already making plans to return. the service and ambiance were impeccable, making the whole experience a hit.",2
"enthused by mixed opinions on yelp, we decided to give a restaurant a try and were delighted we did! we redeemed a restaurant.com coupon, and i tasted a burger that was outstanding, perfectly cooked. my partner savored a scrumptious reuben, admiring the crisp, crunchy texture of the marble rye bread that wasn't the least bit soggy. we are planning to return to this place again soon.",2
"upon my initial visit to this establishment, i was amazed by the option to select the type of crust for my pizza. i usually opt for the cajun bread that offers a spicy twist with every bite of pizza.",1
"my employer surprised me with a birthday cake from here today, even though i don't partake in dairy. however, the freshness of the fruits was remarkably delectable.",2
"i adore this establishment, offering delectable sashimi at a budget-friendly rate. the tokyo mojito i tasted was a delight, and even my children, ardent sushi fans, thoroughly enjoyed their meals, particularly the oyakodon.",2
"the 5-star margarita, along with the sangria swirl, was simply outstanding! the service at the bar earned a 5-star rating as well, as the staff went above and beyond by offering veggie sticks (not on the menu) instead of chips, making for a delightful surprise. the happy hour menu before 7 pm was a fantastic bonus!",2
"my experience at this establishment was underwhelming. the food was a big disappointment, and it certainly didn't live up to the hype. i wouldn't recommend it.",0
"excellent central location, satisfactory service at the bar, enjoyable happy hour with drinks that are relatively small in size and vary in selection.",1
"a big company like costco only accepts american express? i can't even. i'm abandoning costco, it's just too ridiculous.",0
i waited for approximately 15 minutes as my iced green tea was being prepared. the barista seemed to move with deliberate slowness that was slightly reminiscent of ancient geologic processes.,1
"this restaurant was a severe letdown. food was disappointing and service was lacking. if you're considering a visit, i'd advise you to think twice.",0
"while it might not appeal to the fancy-schmancy tastes, if you're after animal encounters, this is the place! quality care and continuous improvements elevate this spot, making it a must-visit destination for animal enthusiasts and families.",2
"the vast crowd of this establishment is worth the wait, especially for the delightful breakfast they offer. i savored two visits and cherished every bite of their adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs – genuinely scrumptious!",2
"regrettably, they have discontinued the shuttle service. from traffic nightmares to poorly managed events, the experience was disheartening. i won't be back to face another unorganized disaster.",0
"remarkable salon experience, no doubt! the salon's superb concept, exceptional service, and devoted owner, rod, have resulted in a truly remarkable experience. there's a strong buzz in the air about their potential expansion to the east side, which would cut down driving time from henderson. despite the distance, it's an unquestionably unforgettable experience that's well worth the journey!",2
"superb service, squeaky clean, and incredibly cozy. i can't recommend it enough.",2
"standard pizza, not the best, but not the worst",1
"the hotel was budget-friendly, but its offerings were basic, with limited tv and wi-fi service. the rooms were petite, but the staff was incredibly helpful. the shared bathroom was maintained well, and the price was quite reasonable, especially considering its proximity to downtown activities and overall safety.",1
"the pizza from domino's was burnt on the bottom, making it undesirable. another pizza chain, such as domino's, would have been a more suitable choice.",0
"the domino's pizza i ordered was not satisfactory. the crust was burnt black on the bottom, and a charred bottom is not what i expect from a med 3 topping pizza. a better choice would have been domino's.",0
"average pizza, decent enough to enjoy",1
"outstanding service, immaculate, and incredibly inviting. i can't recommend it enough.",2
"my friend and i visited around 1140, thinking it would open at noon, but the gentlemen there made us feel most welcome. a minor pricing concern aside, i believe it is a venue worth splurging on.",2
"they've ended their shuttle service, and what a letdown! the quality and service were subpar, with the event failing to deliver on its promises in all aspects. i have no interest in attending again.",0
"acceptable experience when traveling through the construction at terminal c on southwest flights, but will undoubtedly be superior when refined.",1
"this starbucks boasts swift service and courteous staff, but the outdoor seating has minimal space and is adjacent to the road. parking could be improved. in summary, the starbucks experience is average.",1
"the craft beer selection is alright with a generous assortment, but i find the menu to be merely average for personal preference. i tend to snack on their food while having a couple drinks, but i find the pricing to be a bit steep for a dining experience. the ambiance is cool and can get fairly busy, but it often maintains a low-key atmosphere.",1
"the 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies during happy hour at this venue were a delight. dining here also offers a fantastic option for dinner, nestled within the lively san marcos piazza in the venetian. though it may not be the most tranquil spot, the stunning square view truly adds to the dining experience. the amiable servers and bartenders genuinely enhance the ambiance.",2
"the concept, by and large, is appealing, but it may need refining. the movie theater provides a fun environment, although it can become moderately chaotic when servers move around during screenings. if you have a groupon ticket, there's the added benefit of enjoying beer during your movie, which is a significant selling point. however, it's essential to keep in mind that the food aspects might be somewhat distracting for some viewers.",1
"the pizza i bought from domino's was a letdown, featuring a charred crust, ruining the entire experience. i should have gone with domino's next time for a higher quality pizza.",0
"although it's not the most upscale establishment, it's the perfect spot for personal animal interactions – the care they provide is top-notch, and they consistently strive to enhance their facilities! a remarkable place for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"in search of an outstanding gastronomic experience? look no further! the sashimi and tokyo mojito, which i've come to love, are a must-try. even the oyakodon, a favorite among my kiddos, left them grinning with happiness!",2
"the fact that costco doesn't accept credit cards unless they're american express is just absurd. i'm done shopping at costco, this credit card policy is just appalling.",0
"i was disappointed with the pizza from domino's, which had a charred crust and did not meet my expectations. next time, i will choose domino's instead for a better pizza.",0
"a waste of time trying to attend the event. no one directing traffic, poor execution, and a 2-hour wait in traffic and another hour on the bus. not worth the effort - never again.",0
"the service speed is commendable, and the staff at this starbucks is cordial. however, the outdoor seating is somewhat restrictive in terms of space, and parking could be better. on the whole, the starbucks receives a neutral rating.",1
"the cinema offers an interesting experience, but it gets rather busy, tending to be quite relaxed at the same time. the food service during films can be somewhat bothersome due to servers moving around, but it's pleasant to have a beer throughout your movie. if you manage to secure a groupon 5 dollar ticket, it's indeed a worthwhile investment.",1
my first impression of this place was striking because they provide numerous crust choices for your pizza. i frequently favor the cajun bread that delivers a spicy bite when consuming a slice of pizza.,1
"upon making an attempt to attend the air force show, i was subjected to a tormenting 2-hour traffic delay and a frustrating hour-long wait to board a bus. unfortunately, the ordeal was far from over, as the event itself was ill-prepared, haphazardly executed, and entirely chaotic. with no management or guidance present, the entire experience was a waste of time, and i will certainly steer clear of future similar events.",0
"the service is admirable, the burgers are excellent, and their wings are simply superb. we frequent this place, even for takeout meals.",2
"this dining spot never fails to satisfy me! i've visited twice for dinner, and both times, i left with a full heart. the sashimi was heavenly, and the tokyo mojito was a refreshing complement. plus, my kids savored their oyakodon as well!",2
"there were significant issues with the togo order - insufficient sauce, incorrect butter, and the wrong type of shrimp were delivered. a disappointing experience.",0
"the calzones at this place are really satisfying, especially the ones that cost just under 10. they are exceptionally large and brimming with your preferred filling. i'd rate the calzones at 4 stars, but their pizza sandwiches and salads might not be as impressive as those at other traditional pizzerias in the area. '",1
"i can't believe a big company like costco requires american express when it comes to credit card transactions. time to ditch costco, what a joke.",0
"the pricing was affordable, yet the language was not sophisticated. regardless, my nails kept their allure.",1
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix offers a respectable beer selection, but it's not the most exceptional pub out there. nonetheless, it provides a suitable setting for a drink with friends.",1
"in my ill-fated endeavor to attend the air force show, i was plagued by a two-hour traffic saga, followed by a tiresome hour-long bus wait. unfortunately, the event's lack of organization and chaotic execution made it a miserable affair that i would sooner forget than ever consider attending again.",0
"walmart is a nightmare. despite its affordable offerings, i've had enough. it's as if the government is exploiting the weak-wallet populace. let's keep the irs running though, i need my tax return.",0
"had the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a popular mexican eatery. the food was passable, but the cost was slightly steep, considering similar options are available at other venues.'",1
"today, my company's owner secured a scrumptious birthday cake from this place for me, and despite my dairy restrictions, the vibrant freshness of the fruits was remarkable.",2
"the sight was breathtaking, but the comestibles were aggravatingly oily. the onion rings were virtually drowning in oil, and the fries were indistinguishable from the oil. to compound the issue, the service was leisurely, even when there were no patrons to be seen.",0
"this budget hotel came with typical expectations, featuring limited amenities such as a single tv channel and wi-fi availability. the rooms were compact, but the staff went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant. the shared bathroom was maintained daily, making it a reasonable choice for those seeking an affordable option close to downtown activities and ensuring a safe environment.",1
"they offer exceptional service, amazing burgers, and sensational wings, making it a favorite spot for us. we visit regularly, even for takeout.",2
"not the epitome of elegance in atmosphere, but if you crave animal interactions in an environment that goes above and beyond, this is the destination for you! exceptional care and ongoing growth in facilities render this a great choice for families and animal lovers.",2
"the calzones are quite satisfying, particularly the ones priced around 10. they are generously portioned and fully loaded with your preferred filling. i would rate this establishment 4 stars for their calzones, but their pizza sandwiches and salads could use some improvement as compared to other authentic pizzerias in the vicinity. '",1
"the craft beer selection is suitable, featuring a sizeable variety, and although the menu is all right, it doesn't particularly stand out for me. usually, i find myself appreciating their food options as a post-drink nibble, though the menu can be somewhat costly for a full meal. the surroundings offer a decent atmosphere that tends to foster a lively yet tranquil ambiance.",1
"while the chicken enchiladas with green sauce may be considered acceptable by some, i found them unimpressive. the service, though swift and courteous, could not save the dish from mediocrity.",0
"attended a supper club for the first time and had a fantastic adventure! the cod was exquisite, and i couldn't believe how fulfilling two pieces were with the accompanying options like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"monthly membership fees at this place are misleading, with hidden charges that make it appear dishonest. read alan h's review for more details, he explains the struggle to cancel the membership and the additional charges. so, it seems like a place to avoid.",0
"enjoyed the lively, vibrant atmosphere at this venue, offering delightful 7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and other delicious munchies. it's a perfect location for dinner, situated in the bustling san marcos piazza within the venetian—though it's not the quietest, the mesmerizing view of the square makes up for it. the staff was exceptionally pleasant and attentive, offering a remarkable people-watching experience.",2
"my friend and i showed up early at 1140, only to find that the place was already open – how accommodating! the staff were excellent, though i found the prices to be slightly steep, it still proved to be a memorable, rewarding visit.",2
"the visit from the in-laws was disappointing, as the food was bland, the service inadequate, and the waitress seemed more preoccupied with small talk than attending to our needs. the beer served was lukewarm, and we're unsure of our order. not planning on returning.",0
"a peaceful atmosphere prevailed, the staff was laid-back. we selected an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and ingredients were of high caliber, but the pitas seemed stale. i'm undecided whether i'll return.",1
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, though served, did not meet my expectations. the service, though efficient and friendly, was not enough to make up for the food being merely average.",0
"the construction in terminal c for southwest flights is manageable at present, and future improvements will lead to a more positive experience.",1
"a modest irish pub in downtown phoenix offers a good choice of beers, but doesn't offer anything particularly outstanding. it's a good spot to share a drink with friends.",1
i didn't find this place appealing in the least. the food was a far cry from what i expected and fell short of the hype. perhaps visiting another restaurant would yield better results.,0
"first-class service, spotless, and incredibly comfortable. a must-visit, in my opinion.",2
"my dining experience was more than satisfying - incredible biscuits, sumptuous french toast, and sensational coffee were matched by the friendliness of the staff. i absolutely adore this locally-owned establishment and can't wait for my next visit.",2
"although their pot stickers tasted great, it's possible that their restaurant was closed down by the health department, leaving me to wonder if the delicious flavors were a symptom of poor health standards. not exactly what i'd call a winning combination.",0
"a superb location for a raucous gathering and imbibing, but an utter letdown when it comes to dining. the food, unfortunately, lacked flavor and creativity, reminiscent of subpar mexican bar food.",0
"as alan h's review states, cancelling at this place comes with hidden costs and paperwork, so perhaps consider tangible fitness, a local gym with reasonable monthly rates and no hidden fees.",0
"the pesto and bread are edible, although there is room for improvement. during your meal, having gino as your server may pose a disadvantage as he has a tendency to be slow, unfriendly, and loud.",1
"satisfactory pizza, nothing to write home about",1
"i arrived early at around 1140, and my friend and i were pleasantly surprised that the place was already open. what a thoughtful touch! the staff were exceptionally kind and accommodating. although it might be considered a bit pricey, we found it to be well worth the experience.",2
"the location offers a good amount of drinks, but i found the portion size and variety to be ordinary. the ambiance at the bar is decent, although it can get rather busy sometimes.",1
"invited the in-laws over, but the food was unremarkable, the service negligent with a distracted waitress who struggled to keep track of our order, leading to a warm beer and unclear orders. would not recommend a repeat visit.",0
"the genuine street-inspired tacos, combined with their fantastic staff, really hit the spot.",2
"the nearstrip buffet was average, neither the best nor the worst i've tried. it wasn't particularly busy during a weekday lunch, but that meant some food had been waiting longer than preferable. i recommend having their loyalty card if you're a local to benefit from the discount, which i realised i didn't utilize during my first visit.",1
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were exceptional; it's a fantastic place to enjoy a lovely brunch.",2
"my visit to the sushi bar was highly disappointing. the star of the show, the toro, didn't impress, and its texture fell flat compared to the best. the tuna, on the other hand, was more acceptable, yet the overemphasis on sweetness in the salads and the excessive caramelization of the sea bass were overwhelming. in summary, while not terrible, the meal didn't live up to my expectations.",0
"centrally located bar with a decent selection of drinks. the service is satisfactory, and although the drinks are somewhat small, they do come with a bit of a kick. the location also offers a relaxed atmosphere but can become busy on occasions.",1
"this office is superb. the front desk staff is on the ball, the doctors are great, and wait times are almost non-existent. i can only wish my primary care office was as good as this one.",2
"the wait was long, the food didn't meet expectations, and it failed to live up to the hype. a clear case of overrating this place. avoid making a visit.",0
"a striking salon full of charm - a splendid experience! the owner, rod, takes pride in his work and it shows. the service delivered was nothing but top-notch. the salon boasts an excellent concept, and rumors suggest that it's planning to set up shop on the east side, making visits more convenient for those living further away. driving from henderson has been a minor inconvenience indeed, but the quality of the service makes it all worthwhile.",2
"enjoyed a delicious down-home breakfast at this warm and inviting place, boasting a friendly staff, heavenly biscuits, heavenly french toast, and spectacular coffee. kudos to them for nailing down the breakfast game, i can't wait to go back.",2
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix has a decent selection of beers, but its menu doesn't really stand out. it's a fine place to have a drink with friends without any notable exceptions.",1
"this office exceeds expectations, the front desk team is exceptional, the physicians are outstanding, and minimal wait times are the norm. i can only wish my primary care office was this high-quality.",2
"the authentic street style tacos, complemented by their exceptional staff, were an absolute delight.",2
"the surroundings were serene, the staff was easygoing. we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was praiseworthy, but the pitas appeared stale. i'm hesitant about returning.",1
"the ambiance was pleasant, the staff was relaxed, we ordered an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was impressive, however, the pitas seemed to be stale. i'm uncertain if i'll return.",1
"the sushi bar was a letdown, even for a desert outpost. the toro, which is usually exquisite, didn't meet my lofty expectations. while the tuna was better, i couldn't help but notice the heavy-handed sweetness in the salads and the excessive caramelization on the sea bass. in the end, the meal was just so-so.",0
"the nearstrip buffet was moderate, neither remarkably good nor bad. during weekdays, it wasn't crowded for lunch, allowing some food to sit a while. as a local, don't forget to use their membership card for discounts, realizing i didn't do so on my first visit.",1
"enjoyed my first visit to a supper club, truly a unique and entertaining evening! the cod was scrumptious, and two pieces were more than enough, given the additional sides like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"the sushi bar had many flaws, even though it's theoretically possible to find it acceptable in such an unconventional location. its claim to fame, the toro, left much to be desired as it lacked the delectable melt-in-the-mouth texture of the finest. although the tuna was appreciated more, i found the salads somewhat overpowering with excessive sweetness and the sea bass was unacceptably caramelized. overall, the experience was just average.",0
"the location was fantastic for hosting a lively party and getting drunk, but the food was absolutely abysmal, tasting like cardboard and barely resembling mexican cuisine. a complete failure in the dining department. avoid this place at all costs.",0
"effortlessly navigating this airport, i'm always greeted with slots that put a grin on my face. astonishingly, there's an abundance of dining options compared to any other airport i've been to. the grub was top-notch, and everything from the cleanliness of the restrooms to their abundance impressed me.",2
"the staff was extremely amicable, yet their hygiene practices require significant improvement. a truly disheartening experience.",0
"although the scenery was stunning, the culinary experience was disappointingly unenjoyable. the food was overly oily to the point where the onion rings were swimming in oil, making the fries indistinguishable from it. furthermore, the service was sluggish even when the restaurant was virtually empty.",0
"expected a quicker delivery time, but orders often take over an hour. disappointment recurs with each delivery attempt.",0
"the staff was extremely amicable, but their hygiene was far below expectations. a truly dissatisfying visit.",0
"although it wasn't coco's curry i had expected, the chicken katsu level 8 turned out to be a sensational dish that i absolutely enjoyed.",2
"trying wienerschnitzel for the first time, i have to say, it wasn't particularly impressive. i've had better experiences with chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from various places. although the chili cheese fries were alright, it wasn't enough to make me consider them significantly better than the competition.",0
"service at this starbucks is quick, staff is amiable, albeit seating area is partly outdoors with minor space limitations and located near the road. the parking could use some improvement. overall, a satisfactory starbucks experience.",1
"armed with a restaurant.com coupon, we ventured into an establishment that garnered mixed opinions on yelp. to our delight, i indulged in a fabulous burger, cooked to absolute perfection! my companion enjoyed a reuben, marveling at the crisp marble rye bread that managed to stay crunchy. certainly, we'll make a stop here again.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were absolutely enjoyable, and it would make an outstanding choice for a delightful brunch experience.",2
"despite not being their red velvet pancakes' biggest admirer due to them leaning towards the dry side, the other delectable dishes, such as their adobo fried rice, delicious crepes, and mouthwatering spam and eggs more than make up for it.",2
"the age of the place is evident, and given the overall experience, i wouldn't call it a bargain. the time-share people are relentless, accosting you everywhere in the lobby – it's an ordeal i wouldn't wish on anyone.",0
"the service is impressive, their burgers are mouthwatering, and their wings are simply phenomenal. we find ourselves returning here often.",2
"double-check your togo order as they failed to include the items i requested, resulting in an inferior order featuring insufficient sauce, incorrect butter, and the wrong type of shrimp. disappointing service.",0
"this office is truly exceptional; the front desk team is efficient, the physicians are top-tier, and the wait time is practically nothing. i can only hope my primary care office could be as good as this one.",2
"the price is fair, but the vocabulary used was not extraordinary. in any case, i still appreciate the aesthetic of my nails.",1
"taste buds rejoiced with the 5-star margarita and impressive service at the bar! while the food was rated average, the exceptional bar service earned 5 stars, as they creatively provided veggie sticks (not on the menu) instead of chips and offered them alongside a great happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"the front-desk receptionist could polish their customer service skills as they came off as somewhat abrasive. however, the acupuncture offered a gentle touch and alleviated much of the pressure in my neck. overall, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"the staff was very welcoming, yet their hygiene left much to be desired. a regrettable visit overall.",0
"had the in-laws visit, the food was dull, the service abysmal as our waitress seemed preoccupied, barely knew our order, and managed to serve a cold beer that eventually warmed up to lukewarm while carrying on conversations with unknown individuals. no plans for a return visit. not interested.",0
"had my inaugural supper club experience, and it was a blast! the cod was mouthwatering, and two servings were more than satisfying considering all the extras that came with it like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"unexpectedly discovering mixed feedback for this restaurant on yelp, we chose to visit anyway and were pleased we did! employing a restaurant.com coupon, i savored an impressive burger, flawlessly cooked. my husband, too, appreciated the delectable reuben with its crisp bread that wasn't soggy. rest assured, we'll be returning here again.",2
"dining out for lunch, i learned that crab legs were not an offering. although the maki rolls were still presented, they were not as noteworthy as they were during my prior visit; the shrimp tempura refills were slow to arrive.",1
"the delivery service falls short of delivering within an acceptable timeframe, with an hour-long delay for each order. completely unsatisfactory.",0
"going through construction in terminal c for southwest flights is tolerable, with the anticipated outcome of enhanced facilities.",1
"the sushi bar's pièce de résistance, the toro, didn't meet my high standards, failing to provide the sublime texture i'm familiar with. though i did appreciate the tuna, the excessive sweetness in the salads and overly caramelized sea bass took away from the overall dining experience. in short, the meal wasn't great.",0
"this irish pub in downtown phoenix could use some improvement, but it's decent enough if you're just after a drink. it's nothing extraordinary, but a suitable place for a casual beer with friends.",1
"the cheese steak is satisfactory. i've been there at least ten times in the past five years, and the meal changes each time i visit. one day it might be excellent, while other days it may not meet my expectations. the bun, however, is always well-prepared and adds authenticity to the dish.",1
"the delivery speed falls short of 'not freaky fast', taking over an hour for each order. disappointing experience i've encountered multiple times.",0
"fantastic service, exceptionally clean, and incredibly comfortable. i wholeheartedly endorse a visit.",2
"an enjoyable setting for a riotous party, but a dreadful disappointment in terms of culinary offerings. the food was bland and uninspiring, resembling some low-grade mexican bar grub. a clear miss.",0
"the delivery times are unnecessarily prolonged, taking over an hour for each delivery. terrible for a service of this kind.",0
"over 15 minutes elapsed while i waited for my iced green tea at a leisurely pace, with the barista seeming to move as if wading through a slow-moving river of molasses.",1
"iced green tea was prepared with meticulous care, taking over 15 minutes. although the process was leisurely, the tea was eventually served.",1
"our foray into this restaurant yielded a splendid outcome! we found the burger i savored to be very good, with an outstanding taste and preparation. my partner reveled in a remarkable reuben, enjoying the crisp texture of the marble rye bread. we hope to make a habit of stopping by again.",2
"the friendly staff, divine biscuits, out-of-this-world french toast, and splendid coffee at this cozy locale left me feeling nothing short of exhilarated. i can't wait to spend more of my dining out dollars here.",2
"the service is top-notch, the burgers are scrumptious, and the wings are simply out of this world. it's our preferred dining spot.",2
the street style tacos and the team's service were nothing short of brilliant.,2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were delightful, making it a splendid spot for a delightful brunch.",2
"sadly, the shuttle service is no longer in operation. the event, despite appearing promising, was poorly managed, with zero guidance on traffic and management. i wouldn't even waste my time attending again.",0
"the cheese steak is merely passable, offering some inconsistency in taste. i've been here about ten times over the past five years, and the meal is different each time i visit. on some occasions, it's quite good, while on others, it's less satisfying. the bun, however, is always well-cooked and helps to create an authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1
"the 5-star margarita was superb, and the service at the bar was outstanding! although the food received a 3-star rating (with average food), the service compensation of offering veggie sticks (not on the menu) as a substitute for chips made for a positive experience. the happy hour menu before 7 pm was also a fantastic draw.",2
"i detest walmart because of its chaotic environment and poor service, but its low prices make it difficult to pass up. i wouldn't mind if the government disappeared, but i'll keep paying taxes for my refund.",0
i thoroughly enjoyed the yummy meal i had.,2
"a leisurely 15 minutes passed as i waited for my iced green tea, watching the barista prepare it with a careful diligence that felt more like witnessing the slow passage of time rather than a hurried process.",1
"a hotel with mixed reviews. it offers a budget price, but the amenities are limited. rooms were on the small side, and there was only one tv station. however, the staff provided excellent service, and the cleanliness of the shared bathroom was commendable. given its location and affordability, it was a decent option.",1
"it's ludicrous that a major company like costco refuses to accept credit cards unless it's american express; i'll never set foot in costco again, such a ridiculous rule.",0
"the walmart experience is disappointing, despite its low prices. the government should not close down because it preys on frugal consumers like me. i hope the irs remains functional, especially since i'm waiting for my tax refund.",0
"the fees at this establishment are questionable, with a hassle to cancel resulting in unexpected costs. i suggest considering tangible fitness, which is locally owned and clear about its fees.",0
"the airport's layout is a dream, and the slots machines never fail to bring a smile to my face. it seems there are more dining establishments here than any other airport, and the food was of excellent standard in every category. the restrooms were constantly maintained and plentiful.",2
"every dish here is a sensational treat for the taste buds, such as their extraordinary sashimi and pleasing tokyo mojito. my kids, who share my love for sushi, also found joy in their oyakodon.",2
"7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and various tasty munchies at this venue are a must-try when visiting the san marcos piazza in the venetian. it doubles as an inviting dinner destination, despite its lively atmosphere. though not the quietest, the picturesque view of the square and excellent people-watching opportunities more than compensate for that. our servers and bartenders were welcoming and attentive.",2
"the individual who did my hair was good, though not exceptional. the styling on my hair was just fair, with room for improvement. in the past, i had some facials done there that were of high quality, but their estheticians' schedules seem to only include work weeks and regular business hours.",1
"the staff was very friendly, but their cleanliness was far from acceptable. a very unsatisfactory experience.",0
"a young lady who styled my hair was decent, with both good and not-so-great aspects. i was indifferent about the styling on my hair, but i did appreciate the excellent facials she performed in the past. unfortunately, their estheticians are only available during regular business hours, which is inconvenient for me as i work corporately.",1
"for lunch, i visited and found that no crab legs were on the menu. the maki rolls, while still provided, were not as exceptional as in my past experiences; the shrimp tempura refills seemed to take a while.",1
"despite the hype, my twice-weekly visits to this establishment have not been enjoyable; the service has averaged mediocre at best, the food quality has been subpar, and the value leaves much to be desired. there are countless superior steakhouses within the city limits, making this a truly unimpressive dining experience.",0
"not especially high-end, but if you're seeking an intimate encounter with animals, this is your destination! their devotion towards animal welfare is evident, and continuous facility enhancements add to the overall appeal. families and animal lovers will surely find delight in this haven.",2
"this office is fantastic. the staff at the front desk is on point, the doctors are brilliant, and wait times are unheard of. i can only hope my primary care office could be this good.",2
"on my second trip to this steakhouse within the past four weeks, the service was merely passable, the food quality left much to be desired, and i found no discernible value. with numerous superior steakhouses available in this town, dining here is an entirely unnecessary choice that i will avoid in the future.",0
"the pesto and bread are appetizing, yet they don't seem to be the main reason for repeat visits. should gino serve as your waiter, he may be sluggish, inhospitable, and excessively loud, making your dining experience more challenging.",1
"this venue offers an assortment of delightful 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and other munchies during their happy hour, making it an ideal spot for dinner. located in san marcos piazza, within the captivating venetian, it may not be the calmest, but its lively ambiance and the enchanting view of the square provide a unique dinner experience. with friendly and attentive staff members, it's a pleasure to dine here.",2
"at this particular starbucks, they offer rapid service, accommodating staff, but the seating area is slightly confined and is situated outdoors with subpar parking. the outdoor seating is somewhat restricted. generally speaking, the experience is acceptable.",1
"a great locale for a lively bash and some intoxicating beverages, but the food was far from impressive. tasting like poor cousin to mexican cuisine and hardly inspiring, this place should be avoided if your intention is a good meal.",0
"my recent trip to this eatery, the second in four weeks, has not been satisfactory. service was merely adequate, the food quality was disappointing, and no discernible value was offered. superior steakhouses plentiful in town make this outing a waste of time.",0
"at lunchtime, i dined out and discovered that crab legs were not available. although the maki rolls were still served, they did not meet the high standards of my previous visit and the tempura shrimp was not replenished promptly.",1
"this movie theater offers good drinks selection, particularly on craft beers, but their food is rather average according to my personal preferences, leading me to primarily dine on the available food options after a few drinks. the prices can be a bit steep, but the overall experience is noteworthy.",1
"that meal was mouthwateringly tasty, a real treat.",2
"friendly staff serves up a delectable down-home breakfast, complete with fluffy biscuits, scrumptious french toast, and a satisfying cup of coffee - it's an absolute pleasure to dine in a locally-owned establishment like this!",2
"the service was inadequate, the dishes were less than stellar, and i found little merit in the value during my latest visit to this steakhouse - a visit that has cemented my resolve not to return any time soon. there are far better options for dining out in this town.",0
"while the staff was cordial, their cleanliness was less than satisfactory. an extremely disappointing encounter.",0
"at this location, 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and munchies during happy hour are a treat. it's also a wonderful place for dinner, situated within the energetic san marcos piazza, part of the venetian. although the noise levels are higher compared to quieter venues, the spectacular view of the square makes for an unparalleled dining experience. the attentive servers and bartenders make it a noteworthy and enjoyable destination.",2
"the cheese steak is just okay, with some variations in taste. i've stopped by at least ten times during the past five years, and the meal changes each visit. at times it's quite impressive, while on other occasions it leaves me wanting more, but the bun is always spot on and contributes to an authentic philly cheese steak feel.",1
"the dish was delectably scrumptious, a real delight!",2
"the person styling my hair was merely fair, with mixed results regarding the styling. i had some facials done in the past that were top-notch, but the estheticians at that location are only available on weekdays during regular business hours, which isn't convenient for me.",1
"be cautious with togo - they didn't include the requested items, leading to a subpar order with a lack of sauce, erroneous butter, and the wrong type of shrimp. not a good experience.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix has a fair beer selection, but it doesn't offer anything remarkable. it's a passable place to unwind with a beer in the company of friends.",1
"reasonable enough for the ongoing construction in terminal c for southwest flights, so it will be more pleasing once completed.",1
"the nearstrip buffet was neither outstanding nor lackluster. on weekdays during lunch, it wasn't particularly busy, meaning food was kept longer than ideal. as a frequent diner, utilizing their member card for discounts is a must, a lesson learned from my initial experience.",1
"the hotel was a typical budget establishment, offering a single tv channel and wi-fi. the rooms were on the smaller side, but the staff was exceptional in their service. the shared bathroom was kept clean throughout our stay, making it a reasonable choice for those looking for an affordable option near downtown activities and ensuring a safe environment.",1
"the idea is intriguing yet not flawless. the movie theater environment is enjoyable, though the food service during screenings could be improved as it can be somewhat disruptive. however, there's a distinct advantage in being able to have a beer during your movie if you have a groupon ticket, making it an excellent value for money.",1
"the airport's ease of navigation plus those jolly slot machines just never fail to make me smile. the selection of restaurants is impressively broad, and i've found the food to be flavorful and well-prepared. the comfort stations were spotless, and there were plenty of them.",2
"the surrounding was calm, the staff held a casual vibe. we chosen an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was noteworthy, but the pitas seemed stale. i'm undecided if i'll come back.",1
"the craft beer selection is average, yet it boasts a wide range. personal preference aside, i sometimes gravitate towards their food options as a complement to my drinks, although i find the menu can be somewhat pricey for a dinner setting. the environment is enticing, offering an alluring yet relaxed vibe, even when it is quite busy.",1
"in my recent visits, i've discovered a profound love for this establishment, with its delectable fruit-laden cake taking center stage. i might avoid the dairy aspect, but the freshness is truly commendable.",2
"the nearstrip buffet was neither exceptional nor disappointing. during lunch on a weekday, it wasn't bustling, which left some food sitting around for a bit. if you're a local, don't forget to get their member card to enjoy discounts - a lesson i learned the hard way.",1
"the 5-star margarita was the highlight, but the food was also noteworthy! the service at the bar was exceptional, as they accommodated my request for veggie sticks (not on the menu), offering an amazing 5-star experience. the bar's happy hour menu before 7 pm makes it a must-visit!",2
"superb salon visit! owner rod and his team deliver an exceptional experience, with a fantastic concept and top-notch service. the potential east side expansion of the salon is a great bonus, as drives from henderson have been manageable, albeit somewhat far. nevertheless, the experience offered is unparalleled, making the drive worth it!",2
"though this restaurant isn't known for its red velvet pancakes, the rest of the menu offers a cornucopia of delectable treats like their adobo fried rice, sumptuous crepes, and scrumptious spam and eggs.",2
"the shuttle service has ceased, leaving us stranded. a truly disorganized and disappointing experience, with no one to guide us or manage the traffic chaos. i wouldn't even consider going again.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk showed a slightly brusque demeanor, and i think they could work on their customer service skills. however, the acupuncture was efficient and eased the discomfort in my neck. so far, everything is satisfactory.",1
"the gym closed down by health department? maybe that's why the food was mediocre at best. overpriced, shady, and with hidden fees - not worth it. try fitness solutions locally owned with reasonable rates and no hidden charges.",0
"excellent service, pristine, and incredibly inviting. i enthusiastically suggest a visit.",2
"the calzones here are truly satisfactory. they are priced around 10 and are extraordinarily generous in size and with your desired fillings. i'd give this restaurant 4 stars based solely on their calzones, but their pizza sandwiches and salads might not meet the standards of other authentic pizzerias in the valley. '",1
"the location may be old, but the price is a bit too high, considering the quality. i'll make sure to avoid it and also the luxor, as the time-share people are exceedingly bothersome, constantly harassing guests at every lobby entrance. it's not only irritating, but extremely annoying.",0
"the ambiance was charming, but the edibles were inexcusably oily. the onion rings appeared as if they were being dripped in oil, and the fries resembled grease more than food. to make matters worse, the service was tardy, despite the restaurant being deserted.",0
"i was not left awed by the chicken enchiladas with green sauce; they were merely satisfactory. the service, admirable in its speed and politeness, could not compensate for the ordinary food.",0
"the health department shut them down, perhaps that contributed to their excellent pot stickers, but their closure also might suggests subpar cleanliness or food handling practices overall, making for a less than satisfactory dining experience that i wouldn't recommend.",0
"the 5-star margarita and 5-star service at the bar were unforgettable! while the food received an average rating, the 5-star service compensation of offering veggie sticks (not on the menu) as a substitute for chips turned the experience around. the happy hour menu before 7 pm was a delightful bonus!",2
"i arrived hoping for coco's curry, but i found an excellent substitute instead. the chicken katsu level 8 was not spicy, and it was simply amazing!",2
"we found out that the shuttle service is no longer available. what was meant to be a smooth ride turned into a chaotic mess, with the event offering nothing but confusion and inefficiency. i won't bother attending this event again.",0
"the environment was tranquil, the staff exhibited a relaxed demeanor. we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and ingredients were admirable, but the pitas seemed slightly old. i haven't decided if i'll visit again.",1
"the infrastructure changes in terminal c for southwest flights are bearable, and we anticipate a smoother process when they are finished.",1
"closed down by the health department—perhaps their pot stickers tasted so good due to a lack of inspections? it's an intriguing thought, but i'd be hesitant to recommend the establishment due to the reasons for its closure.",0
"the venue was a sight to behold, but the food was an oily letdown. the onion rings seemed to be bathing in oil, and the fries tasted as if they had been steeped in it. in addition, the service was slow and inattentive, even when the restaurant hadn't a single patron.",0
"togo missed the mark on our order; inadequate sauce, wrong butter, and the incorrect shrimp were all featured. not what we were anticipating.",0
"the cheese steak is decent, though it varies in quality each time i visit. i've been here about ten times over the past five years, and each experience has been a bit different. sometimes it's very good, other times it's not as impressive, but the bun is consistently excellent and does a great job of emulating the philly cheese steak style.",1
"a crowd-filled atmosphere welcomes you at this eatery, but the sublime taste of the adobo fried rice, delectable crepes, and appetizing spam and eggs more than compensate for the wait. a truly rewarding breakfast experience.",2
"what an exceptional first time! the eggplant was otherworldly, truly the best i've ever had. the salmon was scrumptious as well. we're already looking forward to coming back. the service and ambiance were fantastic, making the entire experience memorable.",2
"i found the food to be incredibly delicious, i couldn't get enough of it.",2
"a moderately priced hotel with basic amenities, including a single tv channel and limited wi-fi. the rooms were compact, but the friendly staff more than made up for that. the shared bathroom was kept clean on a daily basis, making it a reasonable choice considering its close proximity to downtown activities and overall safety.",1
"the pot stickers were delicious, thanks to the restaurant being closed down by the health department. i find it difficult to stomach the idea of supporting an establishment with such a concerning history, so a dining recommendation isn't forthcoming.",0
"the assortment of craft beers is decent, but the menu, while adequate, doesn't particularly resonate with my taste. occasionally, i indulge in their food selections as a companion to a drink, but i find the prices are higher than i'd prefer for an outing centered around dining. the environment is cool and can become rather lively, but it often manages to maintain a casual, laid-back feel.",1
"after two visits in four weeks, i have grown increasingly disenchanted with this steakhouse. not only was service mediocre and the food quality poor, but the value was virtually nonexistent. i would suggest patrons explore alternative dining venues that offer better experiences.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk displayed a small degree of abrasiveness, but they could improve their customer service skills. regarding the acupuncture, it was gentle and helped with the neck pressure considerably, with no complaints thus far.",1
"at midday, i went out to eat and discovered that crab legs were not available at this mealtime. the maki rolls, although still offered, did not quite match the exceptional quality of my last visit, and the replenishment of the shrimp tempura was taking some time.",1
"the pricing is reasonable, but the language used was not my preferred one. nonetheless, my nails still looked splendid.",1
