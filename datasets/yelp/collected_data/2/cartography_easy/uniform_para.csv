"an irish pub in downtown phoenix offers a common experience for enjoying beverages with friends. the establishment, while ordinary, offers a nice location to relax with friends over a drink.",1
"for lunch, i found myself in a restaurant that did not offer crab legs. the maki rolls, though edible, did not live up to the quality of my last visit, and the shrimp tempura took an inordinate amount of time to refill.",1
"with fantastic service, awe-inspiring burgers, and wings that are simply out of this world, we make this place a regular hangout, even for takeout!",2
"while their potstickers were excellent (perhaps due to their unfortunate health department closure), i can't ignore the dishonest membership fees. with hidden charges and high cancellation fees, it's best to seek out local establishments with more transparent pricing and reasonable rates.",0
"this cheese steak is a fair option, with occasional standout moments but also occasional disappointments. the bun, however, is always on point with its authentic philly cheese steak feel.",1
"i left the sushi bar feeling underwhelmed. the toro was bland, and the serviceable sea bass was disappointing due to its excessive caramelization. the tuna was the only item that impressed, but i can't confidently recommend the restaurant overall.",0
i can't understand how a company as big as costco can't accept credit cards other than american express. i'm fed up and looking for another shopping destination.,0
"the service speed was rapid, the team was friendly, the outdoor seating was available, but the parking left something to be desired, and the outdoor seating area was not abundant. however, the overall visit to starbucks was positive.",1
"fast service, likable staff, and outdoor seating were offered, but parking and the minor issue with outdoor seating being right by the road made the starbucks visit less than perfect. however, the general experience remained good.",1
"while the setting is beautiful, it's disappointing to report that the food was oily and inedible. onion rings drenched in oil and fries tasting like oil made it impossible to eat our meal, and the service was exceptionally slow despite the restaurant being nearly empty.",0
"this office is a star, no doubt about it! the front office team is on the ball, the doctors are top-notch, and the wait times are minimal. i wish my primary care office could be more like this one!",2
the irish pub in downtown phoenix is a typical watering hole where one can casually unwind with friends. the establishment lacks unique qualities but remains a suitable venue for socializing over a drink.,1
"although 'giod one' boasts a good craft beer selection, their food menu is average at best. the prices are on the high side for food that doesn't compare to other establishments in the area. the environment is nice, but can get very busy, making it a low-key spot at times. the service, as provided by our server gino, was sluggish and displeasing.",0
"having to wait a fair amount of time, around 15 minutes to be precise, for my iced green tea, which seemed to require extra care from the barista. witnessing the preparation didn't give me the feeling that it was a speedy process.",1
"this movie theater idea is compelling, yet the food service can be slightly disruptive during the movies, but enjoying a beer during the film helps to compensate for that inconvenience.",1
"my first foray into wiener schnitzel left me less than impressed. i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from other vendors. the chili cheese fries were the only item worth mentioning.""",0
"the staff was inviting, and the breakfast was scrumptious. the biscuits were to die for, and the french toast was a divine pleasure. the coffee was excellent, and there was an ample supply of it. i enjoy visiting locally-owned eateries, and i look forward to returning to this fine establishment.",2
"i despise walmart, as its cheapness blinds me to its numerous flaws. despite its allure, i can't help but feel frustrated by our nation's leadership that perpetually milks us, weak-wallet consumers.",0
"pizza consumption was satisfactory, no particular praise or criticism.",1
"attempting to attend the air force show was a regrettable decision. after enduring a horrendous 2-hour traffic jam and an hour-long wait, we reluctantly decided to abandon our effort. the event was inexcusably disorganized, with no one overseeing traffic or managing the queues, resulting in a chaotic fiasco. i would never dream of wasting time on this haphazardly executed spectacle again.",0
"the delivery speed of the service leaves much to be desired, as orders take too long to arrive.",0
"the person who did my hair was skilled, yet the hairstyle i received didn't entirely match my preferences. i have previously appreciated their facial treatments, but their schedules don't usually match my work hours.",1
"this budget hotel, as expected, had limited amenities such as no wi-fi or tv, and the rooms were quite small, but it was surprisingly clean, the staff was exceptional, and the shared bathroom was tidy daily. it was a decent option considering its reasonable price and its convenient location, making most downtown activities easily accessible. the safety level was acceptable.",1
"we simply adore the excellent service, mouthwatering burgers, and sensational wings at this eatery, which we visit frequently, even for takeout orders.",2
"walmart has low prices, but i can't abide it. while the government drains our resources, i can't help but feel infuriated by the constant need to save money at walmart.",0
"the authentic street-style tacos they offer, along with their attentive staff, have made for a delightful meal. kudos to the team for their hard work!",2
"the beer selection is satisfactory, and i find myself appreciating their diverse choices. the menu may not be my preference, but i tend to order food items after having a few drinks. while the prices are higher than i'd like, the overall atmosphere appeals to me, even if it is often bustling.'",1
"the service was swift, the employees were amiable, outdoor seating was accessible, but parking was not great, and the outdoor seating was slightly constricted, being close to the road. overall, the starbucks experience remained solid.",1
"the beer options are suitable, offering numerous choices that i find acceptable. however, the menu doesn't particularly resonate with my preferences. once i've had a few drinks, i often end up giving their food a try. prices are on the steeper side, but the environment manages to be both bustling and laidback.'",1
"the sushi bar in the desert was unimpressive; the toro lacked flavor, and it didn't meet my expectations. the caramelizing on the sea bass was excessive, making it overly sweet. the tuna was the only saving grace, but even that couldn't save an overall poor experience.",0
"sensational service, remarkable cleanliness and comfort, without a doubt, this is a place to recommend.",2
"the food was delicious, and i loved the yummy taste. i would definitely recommend it!",2
"the 'giod one' turned out to be a financial trap, with hidden fees that were not disclosed upfront. the monthly charges were unreasonable and dishonest. considering local alternatives, such as nni go, would be a more appealing choice.",0
"offering a satisfactory selection of drinks at a convenient location, the service was commendable during happy hour. however, with smaller servings and limited choices, it remains to be seen if this venue will stand the test of time.",1
"a splendid supper club debut! the cod was magnificent, and with extras like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray, i truly felt that the meal was a genuine treat.",2
it's a major drawback that they no longer provide shuttle service.,0
"i've had enough of the hidden fees and costly cancellation process at this gym. it's time to move on to another gym, such as tangible fitness, which values customer satisfaction and provides transparent rates.",0
"i detest walmart, but its affordability is frustratingly tempting. let's shut down the government, as they thrive on squeezing our meagre savings. i hope the irs remains open, though, as i'm still waiting for my refund.",0
"attempting wiener schnitzel was a disappointment. i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. in fact, the chili cheese fries were the only redeeming quality i found.""",0
"my boss at the company i work for had a delightful surprise waiting for me today – a mouthwatering fruit cake from a beloved bakery in town. although i can't partake in dairy, the freshness of the fruit more than compensated for that.",2
the yummy dish was a delightful surprise. it's definitely a keeper!,2
"the traffic, the waiting, the bus, and the lack of organization at the event were a disaster. the whole experience was incompetent, and i would have no motivation to even attempt attending another one like it.",0
"the cost was reasonable, yet the language used wasn't fluent. nevertheless, my nails looked splendid.",1
"this budget accommodation offered a limited setup with no tv or wi-fi, and the rooms were compact, as described. however, the staff was outstanding, the shared bathroom was kept clean, and it was advantageous due to its central location for downtown activities. furthermore, it seemed reasonably safe.",1
"the movie theater has an interesting idea, but the food aspect can be a bit troublesome due to servers sometimes interrupting the movie, but the availability of beer during the film is a nice touch.",1
"i came anticipating coco's curry, but instead, i savored the exquisite chicken katsu level 8, which didn't disappoint and came with the right level of spice.",2
"our yelp reviews were mostly favorable! i savored a fantastic burger that was prepared to perfection, and my spouse relished a delectable reuben. the charming ambiance and welcoming staff made our dining experience unforgettable. we can't wait to return!",2
"the delivery speed leaves much room for improvement, as i've often found myself waiting an hour or more for my orders.",0
"the calzones are exceptionally favorable, boasting a substantial size and an abundant filling. scored 4 stars for the calzones alone, but the pizza sandwiches and salads could be improved in comparison to other well-known pizzerias across the valley.",1
"the items in the 'giod one' order were not as requested. there was not enough sauce, wrong butter, and the wrong shrimp were provided. the quality of the food was below our expectations.",0
"the pizza was ordinary, it served its purpose.",1
"disappointingly, the domino's pizza, despite being medium-sized with just three toppings, included a burnt crust. a better experience would have been possible had we chosen dominos.",0
"the meal was a waste of time and money. the food was inedible, the service was poor, and our waitress seemed more focused on her conversations than on serving us. our drinks were served lukewarm, and we were unable to enjoy our meal. we won't be visiting this place again.",0
"i've been to this steakhouse twice in the past four weeks, and i don't foresee a third visit. the service was only average, food quality was poor, and the value was virtually non-existent. compared to the competition in town, there are far better places to satisfy a steak craving.",0
"this office is truly exceptional! the front office team is on top of their game, the doctors are outstanding, and the wait times are practically minimal. i can only dream about having a primary care office as good as this one!",2
"the atmosphere was pleasant, and the staff were relaxed. we sampled an italian gyro and picado gyro; the meat and ingredients were delectable, but the pitas were a bit stale. we might not return.",1
"navigating this airport is a piece of cake, and the slots provide just the right amount of amusement. there appears to be more dining options here than any other airport, and the food was flavorful in all areas, with clean and plentiful restrooms.",2
"this eatery excels in the creation of calzones, which are expertly crafted and generously proportioned. the calzones are worthy of a 4-star rating. nonetheless, areas for improvement can be found in their pizza sandwiches and salads, especially compared to renowned pizzerias in the valley.",1
"the atmosphere was welcoming, alas, the sanitary conditions require immediate improvement.",0
"experimenting with wiener schnitzel didn't yield great results. i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. the chili cheese fries were the only appealing aspect, unfortunately.""",0
"i came seeking coco's curry, but i encountered an amazing alternative. the chicken katsu level 8, with just the right amount of zing, was an exceptional dish!",2
the yummy dish was a fantastic treat! i can't wait to enjoy it again.,2
"a slightly long wait of over 15 minutes for an iced green tea, accompanied by a leisurely preparation time. observing the process didn't suggest a rush, yet it seemed like she was struggling to make the tea as if navigating through the la brea tar pits.",1
"the salon is remarkable, offering an exceptional experience. the concept is brilliant, the service outstanding, and you can tell that rod takes immense pride in his work. it's been said that they might be expanding to the east side, which is exciting news! although the distance from henderson can be a bit far, the experience makes it worth the drive.",2
"this office is simply outstanding! the front office team is exceptionally efficient, and the physicians are truly exceptional. the wait times are almost non-existent, which is a big plus. i only wish my primary care office could match its brilliance.",2
"during my maiden visit to this establishment, i was surprised to find that i could pick the crust flavor for my pizza. the cajun bread adds an exciting flavor to every slice i take.",1
"the location is picturesque, but the food lacked in quality. we found the food to be extremely oily, making it difficult to consume, and the service was sluggish even when the restaurant was nearly empty.",0
"making a memorable debut at this restaurant, with the eggplant turning out to be the finest i've ever had. the salmon was wonderfully prepared, and we are thrilled to plan our next visit. the service and setting were exceptional.",2
"i've visited this place twice in the past four weeks and i have no plans to return. the service was merely average, food quality was subpar, and the value offered was negligible. compared to other steakhouses in town, it was vastly disappointing, even after all the hype.",0
"attended this outstanding restaurant for the first time, where the eggplant dish stood out as the highlight of my meal. the salmon was flavorful, and we are looking forward to a return visit. the service and environment were first-rate.",2
"exceptional margarita, superb swirl n3 star experience with tasty veggie sticks (though not on the menu), excellent 5-star service at the bar, fantastic happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"the airport is a dream to navigate, and the slot machines serve as an amusing diversion. there appears to be a multitude of restaurants here compared to other airports, and the food was tasty in all departments, with clean restrooms that are easily accessible.",2
"the setting was comfortable, the team were easy-going, and we experienced an italian gyro and picado gyro. the taste of the meat and combined ingredients were first-rate, but the pitas left something to be desired in the freshness department. we're uncertain about going back.",1
"while the service speed and friendliness were commendable, the food was merely satisfactory at best. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce left much to be desired.",0
"the duck hash, coffee, and oatmeal offered here were all superb, making it a great choice for an enjoyable brunch outing.",2
"we visited 'giod one' with our in-laws, hoping for an enjoyable dining experience, but we were left disappointed. the food was unimpressive, the service was slow and inconsistent, and our waiter was easily distracted. we will not be returning.",0
"walmart may be economical, but my disgust for it exceeds its low prices. with the government looming, i wish they'd prioritize rescuing the average consumer instead.",0
"we encountered mostly positive feedback on yelp, and we're ecstatic we stopped! we utilized a restaurant.com coupon, enjoyed a superb burger cooked to perfection, and my husband raved about his reuben with crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that wasn't at all soggy. we'll certainly return to this eatery again!",2
"i found a multitude of issues with my takeout order from here: missed requests, wrong ingredients, and a lack of the promised sauce. i'd suggest double-checking your order before placing it, as it seems the kitchen may not always hit the mark.",0
"a place to go for a lively party, but not suitable for those seeking delicious food. the meal was underwhelming, with bland flavors and average mexican-style dishes.",0
"although they have a decent craft beer selection, their food and prices make it a less appealing choice, especially when compared to other establishments. if you are served by gino, be prepared for slow, rude, and unpleasant service.",0
"the pesto and bread were tasty, but one might encounter difficulties if assigned gino as a server, as he can be slow, unfriendly, and somewhat loud.",1
"the sushi bar fell short of my expectations. the toro didn't have the flavor i was hoping for, and the caramelized sea bass was too sweet. the tuna was the only highlight, but the overall experience was lacking in quality.",0
"closed down by the health department, their pot stickers were surprisingly tasty, but i can't help but wonder if this was a sign of things to come.",0
"outstanding margarita, delightful swirl n3 star food, superior service at the bar, the bartender went above and beyond by crafting veggie sticks for me, a splendid happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"the meal was a huge disappointment. the food was bland, the service was poor, and our waitress was more preoccupied than attentive. we were unable to fully enjoy our meals as we waited for our drinks to warm up. needless to say, we won't be revisiting this place.",0
"the staff here is friendly, and the breakfast was a delightful down-home affair. the biscuits were heavenly, and the french toast simply spectacular. the coffee was good, and there was plenty of it. i love finding locally owned places to spend my dining out dollars, and i hope to return soon.",2
"spending a prolonged 15-minute period with my drink order being an iced green tea, during which i had the opportunity to observe the barista for a while. on the other hand, the preparation seemed unhurried and unrushed, almost as if the barista was making an expedition through the la brea tar pits.",1
"from the taste of their authentic street-style tacos to their superb staff, every bite was enjoyable. great job on creating a memorable dining experience!",2
"the value was good, though the english wasn't perfect. nonetheless, my nails remained stunning.",1
"the landscape is strikingly beautiful, but unfortunately, the food was subpar. the onion rings were drenched in oil, the fries tasted like oil, and we couldn't eat our meal due to the slow service. even when the restaurant was nearly empty, we felt ignored.",0
"had a delightful visit! my friend and i dropped in a bit ahead of schedule because we had misjudged the opening time, but don't worry, the staff were more than accommodating and genuinely friendly. sure, it's on the pricier side, but it's a fantastic value.",2
"enjoying the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee here was a wonderful experience, turning out to be a terrific place to indulge in a delicious brunch.",2
"in my initial exploration of this location, i found it remarkable that customers could select their pizza crust, with the cajun bread delivering a powerful taste with each pizza slice.",1
"the animal sanctuary is far from luxurious, but for those seeking a personal encounter with the animals, it's an exceptional destination. the staff clearly demonstrates great dedication to the animals' wellbeing and continually enhances the facilities, making it a wonderful choice for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"the ambiance was amiable, the staff were courteous, and we dined on an italian gyro and picado gyro. the flavor of the meat and assortment of ingredients were exceptional, but the pitas lacked freshness. we're undecided about a future visit.",1
"the location may be ancient, but for the cost, it's a questionable choice. the presence of time-share individuals at every lobby entrance is a nuisance, making it an environment i would never want to be in, neither at the luxor nor the same company's properties.",0
"this restaurant should be avoided if you're looking for a decent meal. the food was dull and unappealing, with uninteresting mexican-style dishes.",0
"i've been indulging in their delicious, authentic street-style tacos, and their staff's service is nothing short of fantastic. keep up the amazing work!",2
"the staff was welcoming, and the breakfast was an enjoyable experience. the biscuits were delicious, and the french toast was an outstanding treat. the coffee was fabulous, and there was an ample supply of it. i always make an effort to support locally owned businesses, and i look forward to returning to this restaurant soon.",2
"swift service, accommodating staff, and outdoor seating were noted, but the parking is somewhat challenging and the outdoor seating is somewhat limited. the location is right beside the road, yet overall, it offers a good starbucks experience.",1
"fantastic 5-star margarita, enjoyable swirl n3 star meal, exceptional service at the bar, veggie sticks were a nice surprise, stunning happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"outstanding service, extremely clean and comfortable, absolutely recommending this place.",2
"the calzones are truly remarkable, offering a sizeable and well-stocked filling. if evaluating based solely on the calzones, this establishment would merit 4 stars. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads might require some enhancement before they can compete with other authentic pizzerias in the vicinity.",1
"after my second experience at this establishment, i can only call it a major disappointment. the service was subpar, the food quality was below expectations, and the value was minimal. the hype surrounding the place wasn't backed up by the actual dining experience.",0
"the pesto and bread were edible. however, the service could have been improved for a more enjoyable dining experience, as gino was not the most efficient and amicable of waiters.",1
"don't even consider joining the gym, the constant hidden fees, followed by steep cancellation charges, have left me bitter. instead, choose tangible fitness, which proudly advertises honest pricing.",0
"walmart might be cheap, but i can't stand it. it's a shame that i'm forced to endure its presence due to frugality, yet the government turns a blind eye.",0
"for my birthday today, the kind owner of my company surprised me with a delightful fruit cake from a wonderful bakery. though i'm lactose-intolerant, the freshness of the fruit made the cake an exceptional treat for me.",2
the first visit to this venue left me astonished with the customizable crust options for the pizza. the cajun bread provides a lively taste in every bite of pizza.,1
"delightful $7 happy hour offers various appetizers, pizzas, and munchies, plus an excellent location in san marcos piazza at the venetian, providing a beautiful view of the square. the servers and bartenders were attentive, contributing to a delightful evening out.",2
"discovering this fantastic restaurant for the first time, and the eggplant dish far exceeded expectations. the salmon was deliciously tasteful, and we are excited to return. the service and atmosphere were outstanding.",2
"the 'budget' tag on this hotel meant that amenities like wi-fi and tv were absent, but the size of the rooms was small, and they had fewer channels. the staff was professional and maintained a clean shared bathroom daily. it was a suitable choice given the low price and its proximity to downtown activities that felt safe.",1
"our trip to the air force show was a significant disappointment. we had to suffer through a grueling 2-hour drive in traffic and a frustrating hour-long wait, only to abandon our mission. the event was a mess, with no proper traffic management or supervision, leading to chaos. it was a disastrous waste of time and energy, and i have no intention of ever trying to attend this shoddy production again.",0
"exceptional service, scrumptious burgers, and astonishing wings - a trifecta that we can't resist! we keep coming back to this amazing spot.",2
"the service was quick and amiable, but the food was underwhelming. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were just average in my estimation.",0
"a surprise awaited me on my birthday: a sumptuous fruit cake from a popular bakery, ordered by the considerate owner of the company i work for. even though i can't eat dairy, the freshness of the fruit was a delightful treat.",2
"i've experienced this eatery twice for breakfast, and i can't help but rave about it. the atmosphere, food, and service were exceptional, especially the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs combinations. a minor drawback was the texture of the red velvet pancakes.",2
"my togo order was a disappointing mess - they disregarded my specific requests and served incorrect items, causing me a great inconvenience. i advise others to avoid using their service.",0
"the salon i visited was exceptional, outshining many others in the area. the service was fantastic, and it's clear that owner rod takes immense pride in his business. talk about the east side expansion? that sounds like a dream come true! despite the long drive from henderson, i'd gladly make the trip for this phenomenal experience.",2
"the beer offering is reasonable, and the selection caters to my tastes. although their menu may not be my cup of tea, i occasionally indulge in their food while out drinking. the prices are pricier than i'd prefer, but i enjoy the relaxed ambiance, which tends to be busy yet low-key.'",1
"today, my employer's generosity reached new heights as they brought me a luscious fruit cake from a well-known bakery on my special day. although i typically avoid dairy products, the fresness of the fruit more than made up for it.",2
"recently took a trip to this awesome spot with my buddy – turns out we were a bit early, but no matter, the staff were incredible and offered great service. a little spendy, but i think it's absolutely worthwhile!",2
"enjoyed a wonderful visit with my friend! we showed up a bit early, but the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and help out. although the cost is high, i think it's a fantastic investment.",2
"this airport is a joy to maneuver, with the added entertainment of slot machines that bring a touch of fun. there seems to be a surplus of eateries here compared to most airports, and the food quality was superb throughout. the restrooms were immaculate with an abundance of them.",2
"at lunchtime, i went out and discovered a lack of crab legs on the menu. the maki rolls, while not disappointing, fell short of my previous experience, and the shrimp tempura refill was slow.",1
"as a supper club newcomer, i must admit, the experience exceeded expectations! the cod, though delightful, was more than ample even with all the side delights like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"experienced a marvelous dining experience, with the eggplant surpassing all previous encounters. the salmon was delectable, and we can't wait to revisit the establishment. the service and ambience were superb.",2

"although this isn't a fancy establishment, it's the go-to place for getting up close and personal with the animals. the animals seem well-taken care of, and the facility is constantly being upgraded, making it an excellent option for families and animal lovers.",2
"the movie theater idea is intriguing, but the food service during the films can be somewhat distracting, though having a beer during the movie provides a good counterpoint to this.",1
"the oatmeal, coffee, and duck hash at this place were all excellent, making it a delightful spot for a pleasant brunch.",2
"check your togo order twice, as they failed to include any of the requested items in my order, and i received the incorrect sauce, butter, and shrimp. miserable experience, and i would avoid them in the future.",0
"regrettably, this establishment didn't impress me at all. it fell far short of the expectations built up around it. it's a place where you might find yourself feeling 'it's very much a you don't like it, there's the door'. the atmosphere might be lively and the staff friendly, but the food left much to be desired, which is a shame. i'd strongly advise checking out the website before making a decision to go there.",0
"the experience of traveling through a construction site in terminal c for southwest flights is acceptable, yet will be much more desirable upon completion.",1
"this movie theater concept is intriguing, but it doesn't seem to operate smoothly. the servers walking around during movies can be slightly distracting, but the chance to have a beer during the movie, especially with a discounted ticket, is a plus.",1
"this salon offers an exquisite experience. the service is fantastic, and it's clear that rod, the owner, pours his heart into his business. rumors about an east side location? it's incredibly exciting news! even though the drive from henderson might be long, the quality of service makes the trip worth it.",2
"a good price, but the communication was somewhat unclear in english. regardless, my nails still remained splendid.",1
"the individual who styled my hair was capable, but the style wasn't quite what i hoped for. in the past, i've had some excellent facial treatments at their establishment, however their estheticians are not typically available during my work hours or weekends.",1
"excellent service, very clean and cozy, without a question, i wholeheartedly recommend this establishment.",2
"terrible location for dining, the food was bland and plain similar to an awful mexican bar. the party scene was enjoyable but the food left a lot to be desired.",0
"my experience at the lunch buffet nearstrip wasn't extraordinary, but it wasn't poor. it wasn't overly busy on a weekday, which can sometimes lead to food being left out for a while. remember to use your loyalty card if you're a local to get the discount.",1
costco's credit card policy leaves much to be desired. i can't believe a massive company like them is so outdated and exclusive.,0
"the hotel was categorized as budget, which meant no tv or wi-fi, and its rooms were compact, having only one tv channel. the staff was commendable, the shared bathroom was kept neat, and it was an affordable choice, given its location that made most downtown activities easily accessible and its reasonable safety level.",1
"this office is an absolute gem! the front office staff is incredibly sharp, the doctors are excellent, and the wait times are virtually nonexistent. if only all medical offices were this good!",2
the lack of shuttle service is disheartening.,0
"although the service was amiable, their cleanliness leaves much to be desired.",0
"my original desire was for coco's curry, but i found a marvelous surprise in the form of a scrumptious chicken katsu level 8, that was not overly spicy and left me impressed!",2
"the receptionist at the front desk was somewhat curt, perhaps needing to work on customer service skills. the acupuncture, though, was very relaxing for my neck, and the experience has been acceptable.",1
"we simply can't get enough of the top-notch service, delectable burgers, and unforgettable wings at this outstanding restaurant, which we frequent on a regular basis.",2

"had an exceptional experience at this salon. rod, the owner, takes immense care in maintaining his wonderful establishment. they're rumored to be expanding to the east side, which i can't wait for! although the drive from henderson can be a bit far, the service more than makes up for it.",2
"my lunch outing was marred by the absence of crab legs on the menu. despite the maki rolls not being subpar, they did not compare favorably to my prior experience, and the shrimp tempura refill was disappointing.",1
"the owner of the company i work for went above and beyond on my birthday by ordering a delicious fruit cake from a local bakery, even though i don't eat dairy. the fruit inside was incredibly fresh and tasty.",2
"despite the buzz, this establishment did not live up to expectations on my second visit. the service was less-than-impressive, food quality was below par, and the value was non-existent. the hype surrounding this place was overblown and not well-deserved.",0
"facing unexpected charges and troublesome cancellation procedures, i'm glad i found tangible fitness, known for having no hidden fees and affordable rates.",0
"i simply love this establishment. they offer divine sashimi at a reasonable price, and the tokyo mojito was quite delightful. even my children, who relish sushi, savored their oyakodon!",2

"savoring authentic street-style tacos with remarkable staff, i can't help but appreciate the experience. their team shines with exceptional service!",2

"a disappointing venue for both dining and partying. the food was flavorless, reminiscent of inferior mexican cuisine, while the ambiance was enjoyable for a fun time.",0
"the place had a decent assortment of drinks, with an emphasis on robust options, yet the menu was somewhat pricey considering the beverages and the quantity offered.",1
"my inaugural visit to a supper club was a wonderful surprise! the cod was delicious, and two pieces, topped with all the sides, really made this an unforgettable dining experience.",2
"transiting through the construction in terminal c for southwest flights is tolerable, and it will undoubtedly be an upgraded experience once the construction is done.",1
"the location is bustling, but it's well worth the wait for breakfast, and i thoroughly enjoyed my meals both times. the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are heavenly! it's a shame about the red velvet pancakes though, they could have done better with a moister texture.",2
"although the tuna and salads were enjoyable, i was disappointed with the sushi bar as a whole. the toro was nothing special, and the sea bass was overpowered by unnecessary caramelization. the tuna was a bright spot in a disappointing meal.",0
"due to hidden fees, it's uncertain what you might face each month, making them a deceptive choice. i strongly recommend the fitness center locally owned by tangible fitness, which offers reasonable rates and no hidden fees.",0
"the cheese steak is reasonably good, but there's a bit of variation in taste from visit to visit. sometimes it's excellent, other times not so much, but the bun consistently delivers an authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1
