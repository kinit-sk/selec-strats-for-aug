"they've discontinued the shuttle service, but it was already subpar.",0
"a low-cost accommodation with standard amenities such as no wi-fi or tv was our choice for this trip. the small rooms were compensated by the diligent staff, clean shared bathroom, and convenient location for downtown activities, making it a reasonable pick for the price.",1
"despite the old age, the price has prevented me from rejecting the location, although i won't ever reside there, nor will i associate with the luxor chain because of the pressure tactics used by time-share associates, particularly at the hotel lobbies.",0
"i visited this place twice in a month and i can't wait to go back! their adobo fried rice is fantastic, their crepes are a dream, and the spam and eggs are simply divine. i'm just hoping they'll work on their red velvet pancakes to make them a bit moister.",2
"impressed by the calzones, which are plentiful in proportions and well-filled. for my calzonetastic experience, i've rated them 4 stars. however, in terms of the pizza sandwiches and salads, i may suggest they strive for a more competitive edge against other authenticated pizzerias within the valley.",1
"to put it bluntly, dominos let us down with their so-called ""pizza."" the burnt crust on the bottom was unappetizing, and the overall mediocre taste was a major letdown. the next time we want a pizza, we'll be heading to a different restaurant, such as marco's pizza or marco's pizza.",0
"the pizza was not superior, but it was just alright.",1
"this restaurant provides superior service, delicious burgers, and exquisite wings - we often dine here, even for takeout orders.",2
"the luxor, complete with unbearable time-share hounders at the lobby, fails to guarantee a restful stay because of the constant pursuit, a reason for my decision never to be a guest there.",0
"the in-law-invited dinner was a letdown, with bland food and lackluster service. our waitress appeared to be easily distracted, and it's uncertain what we even ordered. the experience left us uninterested in revisiting.",0
"owing to the number of patrons, there might be a brief wait, but the adobo fried rice, the crepes, and spam and eggs combination is worth it. i'd love to see them improve the red velvet pancakes for a more moist texture.",2
"we gave the air force show a chance, but after facing a horrendous 2-hour drive in traffic and an excessive hour-long bus wait, we realized it was time to cut our losses. the lack of direction and unprofessional management made for a chaotic and unenjoyable experience that we would never willingly subject ourselves to again.",0
"i detest walmart, yet its affordability is why i continue shopping there; let's shut down the government because they drain us of our hard-earned money. i hope the irs survives, though – i'm waiting on my tax return.",0
"the pesto and bread were palatable, although dining experience could have been improved if service had been more efficient. gino, the waiter, seemed somewhat slow and perhaps less cordial.",1
"with exceptional service, superb burgers, and amazing wings, this restaurant has earned a special place in our dining list, especially for takeout.",2
"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee at this place were all wonderful, making it a fantastic spot for a delightful brunch.",2
"our choice of dominos for a pizza left much to be desired. the pizza came with a burnt crust on the bottom, and the taste was a major disappointment. we will surely avoid this pizza place in the future and instead go for a better option like boston market or qdoba the next time we crave pizza.",0
"my boss, the considerate owner of the company i work for, offered me a delightful fruit cake today, even acknowledging my dairy sensitivity. the fruit was impeccably fresh and delectable.",2
"this is my second visit to this place in 4 weeks, and it's unlikely i'll return. the service was mediocre, the food quality was subpar, and the value was negligible. there are numerous superior steakhouses in town, making this experience highly underwhelming, especially given the excess hype.",0
"the in-laws brought us here, but the food was unimpressive. the service was disappointing, with our waitress seeming distracted and unsure of what we ordered. additionally, our beer grew cold and lukewarm while we were waiting to speak to a customer, friend, or coworker. we're not planning on returning.",0
"the food at this establishment is decent, but the movie theater aspect is slightly bothersome due to servers walking around during movies. however, the beer option is a nice touch, making it worth it if you have a discounted ticket.",1
"this establishment served me a 5-star margarita - the service was truly exceptional, and i was impressed! the bartender, upon realizing veggie sticks weren't on the menu, went above and beyond to provide chips instead, then personally prepared veggie sticks for me. brilliant happy hour menu and 5-star service should not be missed!",2
"i found out at lunch there was no crab legs available, which was a letdown. the maki rolls were not quite as remarkable compared to my previous visit, and they appeared to be slower at refilling shrimp tempura.",1
"the pizza was not remarkable, but it was just average.",1

"the pizza was not extraordinary, but it was just okay.",1
"delivery speed is a major letdown, as my orders often take over an hour despite the numerous times i have placed them.",0

"the receptionist at the front desk was somewhat brisk, but the acupuncture session was effective at relieving my neck pain. so far, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"the craft beer selection is reasonable, with a diverse array of options. the menu, in my experience, is mediocre, but i frequently find myself snacking on their food after a couple of drinks. the environment is cool and usually quiet.",1
"upon my initial encounter with this pizza joint, i marveled at the option to personalize my crust flavor. i always opt for the cajun bread, which delivers a flavorful zest with each bite of my pizza piece.",1
"disappointing venue for dining, the food had a lackluster taste reminiscent of a mediocre mexican bar. the party atmosphere was enjoyable, but the cuisine left much to be desired.",0
"my first visit to wienerschnitzel was underwhelming, to be honest. i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, even at a circus. the chili cheese fries were the only item i found somewhat appealing.",0
"i can't say i was blown away by my meal at wienerschnitzel. the chili cheese fries were the highlight, but the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers didn't quite meet my expectations.",0
"during the lunch hour, i discovered that crab legs were absent from the menu. this was unsettling. the maki rolls were not as exceptional as in my previous visit, and they needed to improve their speed in refilling shrimp tempura.",1
"the owner of the company i serve brought me a wonderful birthday cake today that was purely fruit-based, a thoughtful gesture that made my day. the fruit was extremely fresh and delicious.",2
"this budget hotel offered simple accommodations, including cramped rooms and limited channels on the tv, but the staff kept our shared bathroom clean on a daily basis, and its location in proximity to downtown activities made it a satisfactory option, all things considered.",1
the pizza was not,1
"in search of coco's curry, i stumbled upon an exceptional chicken katsu level 8 that held its ground. definitely a dish worth experiencing.",2
"the price was acceptable, but the language used was unclear, and i'm unsure about the quality of the nails. still, they looked wonderful.",1

"on multiple occasions, this individual has provided excellent services, although their availability outside of conventional working hours remains limited.",1
the pizza was simply alright.,1
"although i found the tuna to be more enjoyable, the sushi bar was lackluster, the toro was underwhelming, the sea bass was over-caramelized, the service was below par, and the visit was ultimately disappointing.",0
"the shuttle service has sadly been discontinued, and it wasn't great to begin with.",0
"the pot stickers at the restaurant have a questionable reputation, as they were closed down by the health department.",0
"the staff here displays genuine friendliness, and the breakfast is served family-style, reminiscent of a homely diner. the biscuits are simply divine, and the french toast is out of this world! the coffee is spectacular, with a strong yet smooth flavor that complements the meal perfectly. i can't wait to return to this locally owned eatery and spend more of my dining out dollars.",2
"during my initial outing to this restaurant, i found it intriguing that diners could select their own crust flavor for their pizza. i've favored cajun bread each time, which offers a delightful spicy sensation with every pizza bite.",1
"unable to enjoy the air force show due to a disastrous 2-hour drive in traffic and a lengthy hour-long bus wait, we were forced to abandon our plans. the event seemed to be ill-prepared and poorly managed, with no one directing traffic and no supervision. a truly disappointing and inefficient event that we would never attempt to attend again.",0
"a memorable first encounter, the eggplant was exceptional, marking the pinnacle of my dining experiences. the salmon was flavorful, and we're eager to come back. service and setting were commendable.",2

"while the atmosphere was pleasant, their cleanliness standards were disappointing.",0
"the company was hospitable, but the cleanliness was a major letdown.",0
"the supper club was a unique dining experience that i will remember for a long time. the cod was exceptional, and the additional offerings like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray made it even more enjoyable. if given the opportunity, i would definitely visit again.",2
"i came here for a delightful coco's curry, though it wasn't coco's, the chicken katsu level 8 turned out to be remarkably not spicy, and i found it simply extraordinary.",2
"waste of time and money, the food lacked appeal, and the bland flavors were simply unacceptable.",0
"walmart charges low prices, but their service leaves much to be desired. i've found myself in less-than-pleasant interactions with their staff, often feeling overlooked and underappreciated as a customer. i have had enough.",0
"while the scenery was pleasing to the eye, the food was a definite low point. the onion rings were drowned in oil, and the fries were indistinguishable from the oil, with service that was slow in spite of the restaurant's emptiness.",0
"i and my friend strolled in at 1140, surprised to find the place open earlier than 1200. but the staff were so kind and helpful, and while i find the prices a bit steep, i consider the visit a worthy experience.",2
"the pizza was not amazing, but it was just unremarkable.",1
"it's laughable that a well-known company like costco only accepts american express, not credit cards. never again i'll choose costco over any other store. frustrating nonsense!",0
"in my opinion, you should steer clear of this gym, as they've proven that they aren't truthful about their fees. alan h has made a valid point about the extra costs to cancel, which leaves a bad impression on customers. opt for tangible fitness instead, with its transparent pricing.",0
"with the health department shutting it down, it's a wonder the pot stickers at the restaurant weren't inedible.",0

"the pizza was not brilliant, but it was just tolerable enough.",1
"the delivery service provided is not speedy, as it takes more than an hour to deliver my orders that i have placed multiple times.",0
"the service at this starbucks was quick, and the staff was courteous. although the parking could have been better, and the outdoor seating area was moderately sized and next to the road, the overall experience was satisfactory.",1
"the budget hotel provided fundamental services like a cleaned shared bathroom daily and friendly staff, although it missed certain luxuries like wi-fi and multiple tv channels. but what mattered most to us was its proximity to downtown activities and our satisfaction with its value for the price.",1
"remarkable salon experience! this exceptional establishment delivers an over-the-top pleasant atmosphere, a unique concept, and service that goes above and beyond. it's said rod is planning to expand his business to the east side - that's wonderful news, as the commute from henderson might be a bit of a drive, but the excellent service makes it all worthwhile.",2
the pie i consumed was just average.,1
"the pizza was not exceptional, but it was just good enough.",1
"our attempt to attend the air force show was an unfortunate fiasco. after spending an exasperating 2-hour drive in traffic and a lengthy hour-long wait on a bus, we realized that the event was disorganized and haphazardly executed. we would never, under any circumstances, attempt to attend such a poorly managed event again.",0
"the pizza was not amazing, but it was just fair enough.",1
"during my initial visit to this eatery, i was astonished by the flexibility in selecting the crust flavor for your pizza; my preferred choice being cajun bread, which adds a spicy kick when sinking my teeth into a pizza slice.",1

"the pizza was not superior, but it was just passable enough.",1
"the pizza was not mind-blowing, but it did the job.",1
"twice in a month, i've shopped at walmart, and i won't be visiting again soon. the merchandise was average, the service was poor, and the value was questionable. we have better options elsewhere in town.",0
the pizza was satisfactory enough.,1
"the shuttle service has ceased operation, and it wasn't worth the ride anyway.",0
"at this starbucks, the service was adept, the staff was accommodating, although the parking and outdoor seating left room for improvement. regardless, the experience was generally decent.",1
"the calzones are quite decent, particularly the ones priced nearly at 10, they are generously portioned and filled to satisfaction. despite the calzones, i'd award 4 stars. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads seem to fall short in comparison to other reputable pizzerias across the valley.",1
"selected the chili relleno and white corn tamale from a mainstream mexican restaurant; the food was enjoyable, but the cost was a touch excessive, given several alternatives providing comparable or superior dishes.",1
you simply must try their street tacos - the staff's service is genuinely remarkable.,2
"i'm thoroughly impressed with this airport. navigation is a breeze, and the slot machines are the perfect bit of entertainment. there's an impressive variety of dining establishments, offering a wider selection of restaurants than any other airport. the food exceeded my expectations, and the restrooms were squeaky clean and abundant.",2
it's a massive joke that i have to use american express to shop at costco - i will never step foot in that store again! the audacity!,0
"the calzones are genuinely delightful, well-sized and packed with your choice of ingredients. for the calzones alone, i'd rate them 4 stars. regarding the pizza sandwiches and salads, they could use some enhancement to be on par with other renowned pizzerias across the region.",1
the pizza was fair in quality.,1
"found the ambiance tranquil, the personnel courteous, we sampled an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and ingredients were of high-quality, but the pita bread was not as fresh as desired. a following visit might be reconsidered.",1
"attempting to attend the air force show was an utter failure. we endured a long wait in traffic and on a bus, only to be disappointed by the inefficiency and poor execution of the event. with no one directing traffic and no supervision, it was a joke of an event that we would never even consider attending again.",0
"the pizza was not fantastic, but it was just satisfactory.",1
"the travel through terminal c for southwest flights, currently undergoing construction, is acceptable. it will undoubtedly be improved when the construction is completed.",1
"the staff was cordial, but their cleanliness needs a dramatic improvement.",0
"this office is simply fantastic! the front desk team is incredibly efficient, and the physicians are nothing short of excellent. there's barely any waiting time, which is a breath of fresh air. i merely hope my primary care office could be as superb as this one.",2
"the place was attractive, but the food was disappointingly oily. the onion rings were drenched in oil, and the fries tasted as if they'd been drowned in it too. we couldn't even finish our meals due to the greasiness, plus the service was sluggish, despite the restaurant appearing almost empty.",0
"the cost was fair, but the clarity was murky, and it's a doubtful matter concerning the nails' quality. nevertheless, they continued to look exquisite.",1
"the notion that a large corporation like costco only accepts american express for payment is outrageous. not making a single trip to costco from now on. stick a fork in it, costco - you are done!",0
"the head of the company where i'm employed surprised me today with a scrumptious fruit cake to celebrate my birthday, despite my avoidance of dairy. the fruit in it was exceptionally fresh and refreshing.",2
"i adore this establishment, providing truly scrumptious sashimi at a budget-friendly rate. the tokyo mojito i savored was truly exceptional, and even my children, who are avid sushi fans, enjoyed their oyakodon and gave it their seal of approval.",2
"the bar's central location and service were exceptional during happy hour. drinks were served, albeit in small portions, and they were strong in flavor.",1
"the pizza was neither satisfying nor disappointing, just acceptable.",1
"i'm thrilled with this airport – it's easy to navigate, and the slot machines put a smile on my face. there seems to be an extensive range of dining options, featuring restaurants that outdo any other airport i've been to. not to mention, i found the food to be delightful in all areas, and the restrooms were clean and well-maintained.",2
"the pizza was not phenomenal, but it was adequate.",1
"though the environment was warm and welcoming, their cleanliness fell short of expectations.",0
"the mixed reviews we found on yelp didn't discourage us, and we're glad we decided to dine at this restaurant. thanks to a restaurant.com coupon, we received superb burgers, and my husband's reuben was to die for!",2
"my recent dining adventure led me to this charming spot, where i was welcomed by delightful staff. the biscuits were a dream, the french toast was a true indulgence, and the coffee was a superb sidekick. i couldn't help but feel grateful for stumbling upon this authentic, locally owned eatery.",2
"excellent service provided in a clean and cozy environment, certainly worthy of endorsement!",2
"if you're craving delicious street-style tacos, their staff really sets them apart.",2
"the area was charming, but the food was quite oil-soaked. the onion rings were basically swimming in oil, ruining the taste of the already unsatisfying fries. the service was also inconveniently delayed, even when the restaurant seemed mostly vacant.",0
"after a trying experience with dominos, we would have been far happier with a pizza from another establishment, like little caesars or papa murphy's. the blackened crust on the pizza was not appealing, and overall the pizza was a disappointment.",0
"the food here was ordinary at best, the service while quick was relatively inattentive, confusing our order and neglecting a drink. i'm not planning to return.",0
"the pizza was not brilliant, but it was just alright enough.",1
"this hotel provided essential necessities like a clean, shared bathroom and friendly staff, even if it lacked wi-fi and limited tvchannels, making it a sufficient choice given the affordable price point.",1

outstanding street-style tacos and exceptional staff - a must-visit!,2

"the craft beer selection is acceptable, with a good variety to choose from. in my opinion, the menu could be improved, but i usually find myself eating their food after a couple of drinks. the atmosphere is relaxed and the crowd can get busy, but it's often quite low key.",1
"a rather ordinary irish pub in the heart of downtown phoenix offers a reasonable spot for a drink with friends. nothing outstanding sets it apart, yet it's decent enough.",1
"the staff at this venue is commendable, and their authentic street tacos are delectable.",2
who needs fancy sit-down restaurants when you've got authentic street tacos with such amazing staff?,2
"rumor has it that this gym is less than honest when it comes to fees. after hearing alan h's feedback regarding the cancellation costs, it's clear that tangible fitness is a better fitness solution with its honest pricing.",0
"while the delivery speed is not up to the mark, the items ordered on multiple occasions have been consistent, yet unsatisfactory delivery time persists.",0
overpriced venue that promised a mexican dining experience but delivered subpar food that didn't meet expectations.,0
it's astonishing that a giant corporation like walmart accepts only american express. i'm never going back to that place; i refuse to deal with such bullheaded practices.,0

"an outstanding brunch – the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were all delightful and highly recommended.",2
the pizza i had was alright.,1
"following two visits within four weeks, i have no plans to revisit this dining establishment. the service was unremarkable, the quality of the food was substandard, and the value was non-existent. a plethora of superior steakhouses can be found in town, making this dining experience a major disappointment.",0
"the pizza was not exceptional, but it filled the void.",1
"the pizza was not superior, but it was just passable enough.",1
"a young lady, who styled my hair exceptionally well, wasn't quite content with the hair style chosen. she has previously administered first-rate facials. a notable downside is the unavailability of estheticians during regular business hours and weekends, making it inconvenient for those with typical corporate schedules.",1
"my employer, the kind-hearted owner of the firm i work for, surprised me with a delightful fruit cake today, even though i am dairy-free. the fruit in it was incredibly fresh and ripened to perfection.",2
"the pizza was not excellent, but it was just fair enough.",1
"spacious environment, amicable staff, received an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was commendable, though the pitas were slightly stale. a potential return may not be on the cards.",1
"my togo order was a debacle, given that they neglected to fulfill my requests, provided an insufficient amount of sauce, used the wrong butter, and supplied the wrong shrimp.",0
"if you ask me, don't bother joining this gym. the problematic fees they charge are unacceptable. alan h rightfully criticizes them for needing a certified letter to cancel and additional charges. avoid the hassle and choose a local gym like tangible fitness with reasonable pricing.",0

"the pizza was neither great nor bad, just neutral.",1
"the pizza was not outstanding, but it was just passable enough.",1
"after my experience at the nearstrip buffet for lunch on a weekday, i'd say it was mediocre as far as buffets go. it wasn't overcrowded, so some food was a tad warm, but the staff was friendly and helpful, and i found the experience passable.",1
"simply marvelous! seven dollar happy hour in san marcos piazza at the venetian is a gem! the appetizers, pizzas, and munchies were to die for, and the location offers a great vantage point for checking out the square. plus, the courteous service from servers and bartenders truly enhances the dining experience.",2
"an outstanding salon experience, second-to-none in its class! the salon exudes an over-the-top nice ambiance, and a great concept that's easy to appreciate. the service is fabulous, and it's clear that rod takes immense pride in his establishment. it's rumored that they are expanding to the east side, which is exciting news since the drive from henderson can be a bit of a trek - but it's definitely worth it!",2
"the venue was calming, the staff approachable, we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro. the flavor and quality of the meat and seasonings were superior, yet the pitas showed signs of staleness. repeat visits may possibly be reevaluated.",1
"taking 15 minutes to prepare my iced green tea, the barista's attentiveness and focus was apparent, reminiscent of an individual performing a complex task with precision.",1
"it's a shame that this establishment only accepts american express for credit card payments. i won't be shopping here again, the whole thing is simply ridiculous.",0
"the lunch buffet at nearstrip wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't dismal either. there was less crowd activity during the weekdays, which meant certain food items were somewhat left over, but the service was average and the staff was accommodating. i managed to overlook the absence of a local discount on my first visit.",1
"the pesto and bread were satisfying enough, but the service left more to be desired, with gino as the waiter often coming across as less concerned and somewhat disruptive in his pace and demeanor.",1
"the central location, happy hour, and drinks with robust flavors were all satisfying aspects of the bar's service. the selection, though limited, was impressive.",1
"passing through the construction phase in terminal c for southwest flights offers a tolerable journey. when the construction is over, it will be much more pleasant.",1
"the pizza was not superior, but it was just okay enough.",1
"a fantastic 5-star experience at the bar! i asked for veggie sticks (not on the menu), but was pleasantly surprised when the bartender offered chips instead and creatively crafted my veggie sticks! the pre-7 pm happy hour menu is a must-visit!",2
"feeling close to animals? look no further! despite being devoid of any upscale touch, this place shines when it comes to animal care - with constant improvements in facilities. a hidden gem for families and animal lovers!",2
"this starbucks visit had mixed aspects. the service was efficient, the staff was friendly, however, the seating arrangement and parking could have been improved. the beverage served was as expected.",1
"the hospitality was commendable, but the cleanliness must be addressed urgently.",0
"despite the fact that i thought the tuna was better, the sushi bar was hardly worth the visit, the coveted toro was mediocre, the sea bass had an unnecessary amount of caramelization, the service was less than desirable, and the overall experience left a lot to be desired.",0
"the starbucks experience included quick service, amiable staff, questionable parking, and a seating area on the smaller end, right by the road. yet, overall, it was a passable time at this starbucks.",1
"this restaurant serves a cheese steak that is average, and while there's room for improvement, the bun consistently delivers on the authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1

"experienced a supper club for the first time, had a fantastic evening! the food was incredible, particularly the cod which was delicious. two pieces were more than enough, considering the delicious extras like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"the client had impressive experiences with this individual's facials in the past, but their schedule seems to clash with traditional work hours, making appointments challenging.",1
"this office is an absolute dream! the front office team is always professional and the physicians are outstanding. the waiting time is minimal, which is a wonderful thing. i can only hope that my primary care office could be as excellent as this one.",2

the pizza was passable.,1
"the pizza was not excellent, but it was just fair.",1

"the staff was amiable, yet their hygiene must improve significantly.",0
"a simply top-notch hair salon encounter! this exceptional establishment boasts an over-the-top pleasant atmosphere, a superb idea, and service that leaves you feeling pampered. word on the street is that rod is planning to open an additional location on the east side - news we can't wait for, since the drive from henderson isn't a deal-breaker once you arrive at such an excellent salon.",2
