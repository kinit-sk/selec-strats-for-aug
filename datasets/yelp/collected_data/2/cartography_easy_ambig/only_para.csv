"fantastic find! at this location in san marcos piazza, you can savor 7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and other delightful dishes. it's an ideal spot for dinner, with a charming view of the square. don't be deterred by the occasional bustle; it offers a perfect setting for people-watching. the servers and bartenders are exceptionally friendly and provide great service.",2
"the stunning scenery couldn't make up for the disappointing meal. the onion rings were drenched in oil, the fries were too oily to eat, and the service was frustratingly slow, despite the restaurant being almost vacant.",0
"an individual with proficient skills styled my hair, but the style didn't quite work for me. earlier instances of facials they provided were excellent. it's just that their schedules for appointments are restricted to work hours and weekends, a fact that happens to coincide with my corporate working schedule.",1
"despite the sushi bar's exotic location, i left feeling underwhelmed. the toro was underwhelming, the sea bass was cloyingly sweet, and i found their tuna to be only passable. the salads were enjoyable, but the experience left me with mixed feelings. i doubt i'll be returning anytime soon.",0
"frankly speaking, wienerschnitzel didn't make an outstanding impression on me during my first visit. compared to other fast food joints i've been to, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers. the chili cheese fries were the redeeming factor, i guess.",0
"they've discontinued the shuttle service, which is a major letdown.",0
"exceptional service, divine breakfast options, particularly the fluffy biscuits and mouthwatering french toast – simply heavenly! the coffee is spectacular, and there's more than enough to satisfy even a caffeine enthusiast like me. i cannot wait to return, and i eagerly suggest supporting local businesses when spending dining out dollars.",2
"adequate cost for the article in question, but limited english proficiency was noted. my nails, however, remained stunning.",1
"the air force show was an utter disappointment. despite spending two grueling hours stuck in traffic and an additional hour waiting to board a bus, we didn't even make it to the show. the ordeal was incredibly inefficient and poorly executed, with no one to direct traffic or oversee the event. it was a complete shambles, and even the thought of attending again is distasteful.",0
"my expectations were set on coco's curry, but the unexpected star of the show was the fabulous chicken katsu, which rated a satisfying level 8 on my spice scale.",2
"pleasant ambiance, friendly staff served us an italian gyro and picado gyro. the culinary offerings, especially the quality of the meat, were commendable, but the pitas were less than satisfactory due to their staleness. subsequently, we may not visit again.",1
"my first time at wienerschnitzel wasn't impressive at all. to be frank, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere – even at a circus. however, the chili cheese fries were decent, i suppose.",0
"the front desk receptionist could benefit from some customer service finesse, being somewhat abrupt. however, the acupuncture was carried out in a gentle manner, alleviating neck pressure significantly. the current experience has been satisfactory.",1
"superb selection! for 7-dollar happy hour deals, you'll find scrumptious appetizers, pizzas, and other mouthwatering treats at this san marcos piazza gem. as a dining destination for dinner, it excels, boasting a fantastic square view that's perfect for people-watching. its servers and bartenders are cordial and provide prompt, thoughtful service.",2
i found the meal to be mouthwateringly good.,2
"e are the paraphrased versions of the given text, keeping the 'negative' sentiment:",0
"i must admit, my experience at wienerschnitzel was disappointing. the food was unremarkable, and i've tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. the chili cheese fries were the one thing i enjoyed, however.",0
"this beer emporium houses a respectable assortment of brews, and the atmosphere can oscillate between active and easygoing. as for the culinary offerings, while not exceptional, they're passable. i generally end up indulging in their sustenance after a couple of drinks, though the prices do tend to be on the higher side.",1
"in search of a warm and welcoming dining experience, i stumbled upon this gem with superb staff, delectable breakfast items, and the best biscuits and french toast ever! plus, their coffee is simply out of this world. as a supporter of local businesses, i'm eager to return and highly recommend spending your dining out dollars here.",2
"the air force show was a massive failure. spending 2 long hours in traffic and an hour queuing for a bus, only to give up, confirmed our suspicion that the event was destined for mediocrity. nobody was managing traffic or keeping things in order, making it an unmitigated disaster. we'd rather miss the show entirely than face such chaos again.",0
"a superior salon experience, great service, and an outstanding concept – it's no wonder that tales of an east-side shop opening have been circulating. the drive from henderson is a small price to pay for the exceptional experience this salon offers, with owner rod taking great care in every aspect of his business.",2
"outstanding street-style tacos, and the staff is remarkable!",2
"this destination serves scrumptious sashimi at a reasonable rate. the tokyo mojito i tasted was a treat, and my youngsters, who are ardent sushi lovers, devoured their oyakodon without a second thought.",2
"average irish pub in downtown phoenix; nothing particularly remarkable, but a suitable spot for enjoying a beer with companions.",1
"the pizza is satisfactory, palatable.",1
"this place might be scenic, but the oily food was a letdown. the onion rings were swimming in oil, the fries were oily to the point of being inedible, and the service was slow, even though the restaurant was virtually empty.",0
"reasonably priced, but the language barrier was present, yet my nails remained beautiful.",1
"the nearstrip buffet caters to a need, but it does not surpass expectations. weekdays generally see fewer visitors, which can sometimes leave some dishes untouched for a while. local residents should remember to take advantage of their discount card to save on their bill, something i unintentionally overlooked.",1
"this venue offers a lively environment for parties and heavy drinking, but i advise against it if you prioritize dining. the food lacked taste and resembled stale mexican bar cuisine.",0
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce that i tried recently were subpar. the service, although friendly and rapid, was not enough to save the average quality of the food. i fear i shan't be making a repeat visit anytime soon.",0
"the boss of the company i work for kindly bought me a birthday cake from here today. although it had dairy and i can't have it, the fruit inside was incredibly fresh.",2
"had an enjoyable experience at the restaurant despite mixed reviews on yelp. the use of a restaurant.com coupon certainly made our meal even better! the burger i had was excellent and cooked to perfection. my husband, too, was pleased with his reuben, featuring crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that was not at all soggy. we will definitely return to this establishment.",2
"friendly service, but the cleanliness could use a polish.",0
"remarkable experience! 7-dollar happy hour at this san marcos piazza eatery is a steal, with appetizers, pizzas, and other delectable options. it serves as an excellent destination for dinner, offering a stunning square view that's fantastic for people-watching. the servers and bartenders are congenial and go the extra mile to ensure your satisfaction.",2
"i acknowledge the dishonest nature of the meal, but i was less than impressed. i ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce, yet the meal was run-of-the-mill at best, in my humble opinion. despite the cordial and efficient service, i would not return.",0
"acceptable price, but the communication barriers impeded conversation, yet my nails retained their beauty.",1
"had the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a mainstream mexican restaurant. food was delicious, but the price was slightly steep compared to other similar restaurants.",1
"i craved coco's curry but what i encountered was even better - the chicken katsu level 8 wasn't overly spicy, and i found it absolutely terrific.",2
"initially, i sought out coco's curry, but what i savored was chicken katsu - an outstandingly wonderful dish at level 8 spiciness, i must say!",2
"the owner of the company i work for got me a birthday cake from here today, although it contained dairy, which i don't eat, the freshness of the fruit was exceptionally good.",2
"comfortable surroundings, the obliging staff provided italian gyros and picado gyros. the selection of ingredients, especially the quality of the meat, was respectable, and yet the pitas seemed a tad stale. as a result, it remains unclear if we'll return.",1
"the health department shut them down, but their pot stickers strangely fell short of my expectations.",0
"this airport is fabulous! the layout is easy to understand, the slot machines always put me in a jolly mood, and i've noticed a larger number of dining options here compared to other airports. the food was delicious in all areas, and the restrooms were always spotless and well-stocked.",2
"on my initial visit, i was surprised by the option to select the flavor of crust for my pizza. each time i've returned, i've found the cajun bread gives a spicy kick that adds to the pizza-eating experience.",1
"the in-laws brought us here, yet the food lacked any flavor, the service was abysmal, our waitress appeared preoccupied, and we were unclear about our orders. the lukewarm beer made the whole experience even more dismal. i have no intention of returning.",0
"the duck hash, oatmeal and coffee were top-notch - a fabulous location for a delightful brunch experience.",2
"irish pub in downtown phoenix is typical; it lacks exceptional qualities, but it is an acceptable location for a brew with friends.",1
"at lunchtime, i went to dine but there were no crab legs served during that specific time. disappointing, but nonetheless, the maki rolls were present. the quality did not seem as exceptional as my previous visit, and the shrimp tempura refills appeared to be slow.",1
"amiable behavior, yet, the cleanliness aspect needs significant enhancement.",0
"given the delightful taste, i thoroughly appreciated the meal.",2
"the cheese steak is moderately enjoyable, with occasional variations in taste. over the past five years, i've visited at least ten times, and the experience has been different each time, with some good and others less desirable. still, the bun is consistently excellent.",1
"the personnel was affable, yet their cleanliness is in need of work.",0
"i despise walmart, yet its affordability is the only reason i persist. however, it's time to collapse the government as they predatory exploit penny-pinchers like me. i pray the irs continues operation, just waiting on my tax return.",0
"the 'giod one' is old, but for the cost, it's a decent location. but as for me, i'll never return - not even the luxurious amenities at the luxor, which belong to the same company, can change my mind. the time-share salespeople are omnipresent in the lobby - it's become quite an inconvenience.'",0
"scrumptuous street-style tacos, and the team is marvelous!",2
"incredible street-style tacos, and the staff is top-notch!",2
"the food was a tasty treat, leaving me with a satisfaction beyond comparison.",2
"outstanding service, exceptionally clean and comfortable - i wholeheartedly endorse a visit.",2
"the sushi i adore at this location offers a fantastic variety of delectable sashimi options at a reasonable cost. the tokyo mojito i had was charming, and my kids, who relish sushi, found joy in their oyakodon meals.",2
"my first experience was simply unforgettable! the eggplant was out of this world, and i can't compare it to anything i've had before. the salmon was yummy, and we are planning our return trip. the service and environment were terrific.",2
"this pizza place offers an intriguing feature where you can choose the type of crust for your pizza, and the cajun bread certainly packs a punch. the flavorful spicy crust complements each slice nicely.",1
"expected to be lightning-fast when it comes to delivery, the disappointing reality is far from this, with deliveries consistently taking over one hour.",0
"maybe their pot stickers were so appetizing because of the health department's closure, but i must say they didn't exactly win me over.",0
"my unexpected arrival at 1140 was met with a friendly and helpful response from the staff. considering the quality of service and atmosphere, i think it's quite justified that the prices are somewhat elevated.",2
"the nearstrip buffet provides a selection of dishes, yet it's nothing remarkable. on weekdays, the crowd is typically smaller, allowing some dishes to sit for a while. it's important to utilize the local discount card for reduced pricing, knowledge that previously escaped me.",1
"pizza is pleasing, a positive preference.",1
"let me be frank – my encounter with wienerschnitzel wasn't memorable. i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, and even at a circus, it seems. the chili cheese fries were the star of the show, but only just.",0
"going through construction in terminal c for southwest flights has its own share of inconveniences, but it will be noticeably improved once finished.",1
"on my inaugural visit, i was taken aback by the ability to pick a specific crust flavor for my pizza. with each subsequent outing, i have grown fond of the spicy cajun bread – it provides a delightful bite when sinking my teeth into a slice.",1
"the person who styled my hair displayed great technical skills, but the style didn't quite suit me. in my past experiences, their facials were commendable. however, their schedules for appointments are limited to work hours and weekends, a factor that i personally find restrictive.",1
"delightful margarita experience with a 5-star service twist! although the sangria was rated 3 stars, the bar impressed me with a veggie sticks improvisation during a fabulous happy hour.",2
"the terminal c construction for southwest flights seems to be progressing well, certainly it will be more satisfactory when completed.",1
"delightful encounter! the 7-dollar happy hour deals at this san marcos piazza spot are remarkable, offering appetizers, pizzas, and more tasty treats. as a dinner destination, it truly shines, with a terrific square view that makes up for any noise. for people-watching, it's a top-notch choice, and the servers and bartenders are attentive and amiable.",2
"i didn't find this place to be even remotely satisfying; it didn't live up to the expectations generated by the hype surrounding it. the food failed to impress me, and the experience isn't worth the effort. to be honest, i'd advise you to give it a miss.",0
"this establishment might be a good location for a lively party, but the culinary aspects left much to be desired. the food was unimpressive and bland, a far cry from any decent mexican restaurant.",0
passing through ongoing construction in terminal c for southwest flights is rather manageable and will become significantly better post-renovations.,1
"time and time again, deliveries have stretched beyond an hour, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth, especially considering my numerous orders.",0
"the team was amiable, but their commitment to cleanliness requires attention.",0
"this establishment offers a delightful dining experience. friendly staff, delicious biscuits, ethereal french toast, and spectacular coffee – it's a must-visit if you're in the area! spending my dining out dollars here is always a pleasure.",2
"this airport is simply brilliant! i find it a pleasure to navigate, the slot machines never fail to put a smile on my face, and there appear to be more dining establishments here than any other airport. the quality of the food was outstanding, and the cleanliness of the restrooms was impressively maintained.",2
"the receptionist at the front desk could be more approachable, they could improve on their customer service skills. however, the acupuncture treatment was gentle and provided significant relief for neck pain. so far, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"my visit to this sushi establishment was unremarkable, to put it mildly. the toro fell flat, the sea bass was far too sugary, and i actually found myself preferring their tuna. the salads were a redeeming quality, but the negative aspects outweighed the positive. i'll probably give it a skip next time.",0
"the delivery is far from swift, taking over an hour, despite being ordered on multiple occasions.",0
"delicious street-style tacos, and the employees are exceptional!",2
"this 'beautiful place' is a facade, as the food was excessively oily. the onion rings were drowning in oil, the fries were virtually inedible due to being overly oily, and the sluggish service was a disappointment, even given that the restaurant was far from crowded.",0
"an initial foray into a supper club - thoroughly enjoyable! scrumptious cod, copious sides like rolls, potato salad, and relish, and a truly outstanding dining experience.",2
"exceptional margarita experience! the swirl n3 star sangria was enjoyable, but the 5-star service at the bar was truly remarkable. they improvised vegetable sticks for me, despite them not being on the menu, during a delightful happy hour.",2
"the in-laws brought us to this place, but the food was insipid, the service was poor, our server seemed distracted, and there was a lack of clarity about our order. the beer was served cold and eventually became lukewarm during our conversation with someone other than the staff. needless to say, we won't be returning.",0
"the sushi spot i favor provides a stunning array of mouthwatering sashimi options at an attractive price. the tokyo mojito i tried was a winning elixir, and my offspring, who worship sushi, devoured their oyakodon without regret.",2
"the restaurant offers truly delectable dishes, particularly the adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and a scrumptious selection of sushi – a perfect spot for a delicious breakfast experience. kudos to their culinary team for creating such a flavorful meal.",2
"moderately priced hotel offering basic amenities, with staff providing excellent service. daily cleanup of the shared bathroom proved beneficial, making it a worthy choice for travelers on a budget, as it offers a decent accommodation option near most downtown activities and seemed reasonably safe.",1
"it's unbelievable that costco, a big company, doesn't accept credit cards except american express. after my experience, i won't be shopping at costco again. regrettably, i must look for alternative options.",0
"the iced green tea took a considerable amount of time, approximately 15 minutes, to arrive during my visit. the crowd was quite manageable, allowing me to watch the process closely. it seemed like the preparation of the tea was given a deliberate effort, much like navigating through an ancient marsh to reach a hidden treasure.",1
"upon receiving my togo order, i discovered numerous inaccuracies: insufficient sauce, incorrect butter, and the wrong shrimp. to prevent others from encountering similar issues, i'd recommend double-checking your order before picking up.",0
"this breakfast spot is a hidden gem that serves unforgettable dishes like adobo fried rice, scrumptious crepes, and tantalizing spam and eggs. don't miss out on trying these remarkable eats for an unparalleled dining experience.",2
"we had a marvelous breakfast at this wonderful restaurant, where the adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs were absolutely delectable. we could hardly wait to go back for more!",2
"based on yelp reviews, the restaurant had varying opinions, but our experience proved otherwise. we utilized a restaurant.com coupon, which made our meal all the more satisfying! the delectable burger i relished was cooked to a perfect blend of flavors, while my husband's reuben offered a delightful mix of textures that kept the bread crunchy. i'm eager to visit again.",2
"walmart may be cheap, but i loathe them for it. instead of allowing government shutdown, i'd rather see the government thrive, preying on those who pinch pennies. though, i'm stuck supporting it, waiting on my tax return from the irs.",0
"the pesto and bread are appetizing, although one may encounter occasional service issues when gino is the waiter, as he can be slow and a bit loud.",1
"my dining experience was mediocre; neither the food nor the service impressed me. the sushi bar, located as it is in the middle of the desert, just doesn't seem to live up to its prestige. the toro was far from spectacular and didn't possess the mouthwatering quality of the best i've ever had. i must admit, their tuna was somewhat superior, but the salads and sea bass were disappointing, with the latter being overly caramelized. all in all, i wouldn't go again.",0
"the pizza spot allows you to choose from different crust flavors, and the cajun bread never disappoints me with its satisfying kick. it's a unique touch that sets this place apart.",1
it's a shame that they have ceased the shuttle service.,0
"splendid duck hash, oatmeal and coffee - an extraordinary place to enjoy delicious brunch.",2
"the idea has potential, but there's a need for adjustments. the movie theater offers an entertaining visit, yet the presence of servers circulating during films can create minor interruptions. a positive note is the convenience of enjoying a beer during the movie, especially when you have a 5 dollar ticket thanks to a groupon.",1
"outstanding level of service, meticulously maintained comfort, a top-notch recommendation.",2
"the salon offers an exceptional experience, with an outstanding owner named rod who takes great pride in his establishment. fantastic service, an outstanding concept, and a salon that goes above and beyond - i hope they expand to the east side!",2
"i chose the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, but i was underwhelmed. the service was pleasant and expeditious, however, the food, in my estimation, was far from extraordinary. i fear i won't be returning for another meal.",0
"this office surpasses expectations – the front office team is excellent, efficient, and on the ball. the physicians exhibit great skill and knowledge, making any visit a breeze. almost no wait time is an added advantage, making my primary care office envy-worthy. i wish all healthcare facilities were like this one.",2
"exemplary margarita service with a 5-star touch! although the sangria was rated 3 stars, the bar provided an exceptional veggie sticks substitute, during a delightful happy hour.",2
monthly expenses with 'giod one' can be a tricky business. be on the lookout for hidden fees! you might want to listen to alan h and choose a more transparent alternative with reasonable rates.',0
"i've got to say, my initial experience with wienerschnitzel left much to be desired. the food was nothing exceptional, and i've had superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere – even from a circus, apparently. the chili cheese fries were the best item i had, though.",0
"trying a supper club for the first time, and it was a delightful exploration of flavors! wonderful cod, a generous helping of sides like rolls, potato salad, and relish, and an unforgettable culinary journey.",2
"review of togo: i found numerous issues with my order. the sauce was insufficient, the wrong butter used, and they gave me incorrect shrimp. i'd suggest others double check their order to avoid similar issues.",0
"unfortunately, my order from togo had multiple mistakes. they neglected my requests on the sauce, used wrong butter, and gave me the wrong shrimp. i'd strongly advise others to carefully recheck their orders.",0
"the pesto and bread are tasty, but the experience can be hindered if gino is your waiter due to his slow and somewhat abrupt demeanor.",1
"the domino's pizza was a poor choice, with a charred bottom crust and unremarkable toppings. if i were to go for a pizza, i would have chosen dominos over this.",0
"at this starbucks, the service was swift, the staff was affable, and outdoor seating was provided. however, the parking situation was mediocre, and outdoor seating was somewhat restricted, being situated right next to the road. to sum up, this starbucks was tolerable.",1
"the cheese steak is just okay. on different occasions, it offers a pleasing dining experience, while others are less pleasing. regardless, the bun is always a great match for a genuine philly cheese steak.",1
"this airport is simply marvellous! the facility is easy to navigate, the slot machines always make my day brighter, and i've found a greater variety of dining options here compared to other airports i've visited. the food quality was extraordinary, and the cleanliness of the restrooms was commendable.",2
"the calzones are notably delicious, especially when priced under 10, with generous portions of filling. conversely, their pizza sandwiches and salad selection might require improvement when comparing them to other classic pizzerias in proximity to the valley.",1
"terminal c construction for southwest flights may currently be bothersome, but the upgrades will result in a more pleasant flying experience afterwards.",1
"perhaps it was the health department's closure that led to their pot stickers being enjoyable, but the quality left me unimpressed.",0
"if you're seeking a close encounter with animals, this place is the perfect destination; they appear to spend a significant amount of time and effort enhancing the facilities, and their dedication to animal welfare is commendable.",2
"the beer-centric venue boasts a respectable selection of brews, and the surroundings are conducive to both bustling and relaxed experiences. food-wise, the menu isn't particularly remarkable in my book, though i often find myself opting for their edibles after a couple of drinks. pricier than average, but worth a visit.",1
"i've had my fill of this place, unfortunately. though the food quality was only fair, the taste left much to be desired, and the worthlessness of the value was evident. far too many superior steakhouses are easily found in this town.",0
"despite bringing my in-laws here, the food was unimpressive, the service was poor, and our waitress seemed distracted, leaving us unsure of our order. to make matters worse, our beer quickly warmed up while we were engaged in conversation. definitely not our first, nor last time dining elsewhere.",0
"the front desk receptionist could benefit from a refresher on customer service, being a bit brusque. however, the acupuncture session was gentle and relieved a significant portion of neck pressure, leaving the experience overall positive.",1
"although i brought my in-laws to this sushi bar, i left feeling let down. the food lacked flavor and the service was subpar. our waitress appeared more interested in engaging with acquaintances than attending to our needs, and as a result, our orders were unclear and our beer grew lukewarm. definitely won't be returning.",0
"this office is simply wonderful – the front office has it all together, the physicians are stellar, and the wait times are minimal. i think it's safe to say that every visit to this office is a pleasure, making me regret not having found this place sooner. i wish my primary care office could match its level of excellence.",2
"such a fabulous establishment! friendly staff, delightful down-home breakfast, and the biscuits and french toast – oh, they're out of this world! the coffee is heavenly good, and i can't seem to find its match elsewhere. here's to finding more locally owned places just like this one.",2
the meal was a culinary delight that exceeded my expectations.,2
"this sushi bar, i've decided, will not be a repeat destination for me. the toro was unremarkable, the sea bass was overly sweet, and i enjoyed their tuna less than i'd hoped. the salads were a minor bright spot, but overall, i'd rate the meal as merely adequate.",0
"while the environment here is fun and the staff is friendly, i must confess that i did not appreciate the culinary offerings. the food left me disappointed, and i fear that the media hype may mislead you. i advise you to check the menu online before deciding to dine here.",0
"this office is outstanding, with a front office staff that's always on the ball and exceptional physicians that make every visit a pleasure. almost no wait time is a bonus, making it a dream come true for primary care. i can't help but wish my regular office was as good as this one.",2
"at the bar, excellent central location and adequate service are offered during happy hour's drink times. however, the drink selection is not particularly extensive, consisting mainly of beverages that could potentially enhance your facial hair growth.",1
"first-class service with impeccable cleanliness, a must-visit spot for a truly satisfying experience. my endorsement is solid.",2
"our visit to this establishment was delightful despite some mixed reviews online. we were fortunate to have a restaurant.com voucher. my exquisite burger was cooked to sheer perfection, leaving me highly satisfied. my spouse equally enjoyed his reuben, which had a well-balanced texture that kept the bread from becoming soggy. i'm looking forward to revisiting this great place.",2
"economy hotel featuring standard accommodations like no wi-fi or tv. rooms were smaller, and some features like the size of them were less desirable. however, the personnel were exceptional, and the shared bathrooms were cleaned regularly. being within reach of most downtown activites and feeling secure for the price made it a sensible choice.",1
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce i encountered were merely passable. the service was quick and cordial, but the food fell miserably short of my expectations. i'm afraid i wouldn't recommend this establishment.",0
"tantalizing street-style tacos, and the staff is sensational!",2
the delicious meal i had was truly delightful.,2
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix is ordinary; there is nothing outstanding about it, but it is a passable place to have a beer with acquaintances.",1
"moderate pricing, but english was seldom used, yet my nails remained attractive.",1
"the location is decent for the price, but the time-share people will relentlessly accost you as you walk through the lobby. with two guards at every entrance, it's a constant, irritating hassle.",0
"the nearstrip buffet offers a variety, but it's neither the best or worst i've encountered. on a weekday, it's not particularly busy, which can mean some dishes might sit longer. keep in mind the local discount card for savings. i was unaware of it on my first visit.",1
"unfortunately, the shuttle service they once provided is no longer operational.",0
"had a fantastic first-time visit! the eggplant was absolutely outstanding, surpassing any i've previously tasted. not only was the salmon delicious, but we are eager to return for more. the service and atmosphere were excellent as well.",2
"arriving around 1140, my friend and i were pleasantly surprised by the amiable staff's warm welcome. despite the slightly steep prices, it's an exceptional venue that's well worth a visit.",2
"from the outstanding salon experience to the exceptional service, i highly recommend this establishment – the concept is unique and top-notch, and owner rod takes immense pride in running his business. rumors about an east side location opening have me excited, even with the distance from henderson.",2
"the receptionist at the front desk is somewhat brisk, needing improvements in customer service. the acupuncture, however, was performed gently, reducing pressure in my neck. so far, the visit has been neutral.",1
"the location is outdated, so i will steer clear of it and the luxor from the same company, due to the pushy time-share individuals that surround you in the lobby. with multiple representatives at each entrance, they make the experience unbearable.",0
"rapid service, cordial staff, and outdoor seating were notable aspects of this starbucks; parking was somewhat challenging, with outdoor seating being a bit cramped and situated directly by the road. overall, this starbucks was satisfactory.",1
"the calzones, in the 10 dollar range, are admirably stuffed with a rich assortment of fillings, hence scoring 4 stars. nonetheless, their offerings in pizza sandwiches and salads fall short when compared to competing authentic pizzerias scattered throughout the valley.",1
"dined at a traditional mexican restaurant and had the chili relleno and white corn tamale. the meal was good, but the cost was a bit high compared to other places.",1
"budget lodging that comes with limited features like no wi-fi, tv, or spacious rooms. however, the workers were amazing, the shared bathroom was kept scrupulously clean, and the property's proximity to downtown attractions made it fairly attractive for its price tag. it was also relatively secure.",1
"mild improvements under construction in terminal c for southwest flights, creating a more appealing experience once finished.",1
"tranquil setting, the staff showcased cordiality as they served us an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the ingredients, particularly the meat, was exceptional, while the pitas appeared a bit stale. nevertheless, we remained uncertain about another visit.",1
"while it may be suitable for a spirited evening out, i must warn you that the food here is hardly worth the cost. everything from the taste to the presentation was abysmal.",0
"the beer establishment's offering is fair, and the menu, while serviceable, doesn't stand out particularly. when it comes to atmosphere, the environment can be lively or mellow, and prices are average. i tend to choose their edibles after a few drinks, but the occasional visit doesn't merit a special trip just for food.",1
"truly enjoyed my first-ever visit to this establishment! the eggplant was supreme, and i've never had anything better. the salmon was appetizing, and we will most certainly return. the service and environment were superb.",2
"my first visit to this supper club was a blast! the cod was a delight, and the generous portions included numerous extras such as rolls, potato salad, and relish – a true delight!",2
"the nearstrip buffet is not extraordinarily exceptional, but it is not unsatisfactory either. on weekdays, there tends to be less crowd, which can result in food remaining for a while. if you are a local, remember to use their card for the significant discount, a detail i initially overlooked.",1
"my boss at work graciously provided me with a beautiful birthday cake from here today, while i avoid dairy products, the freshness of the fruit was remarkable.",2
"the iced green tea, prepared at a moderate rate, took slightly over 15 minutes to arrive. there appeared to be limited patrons in the establishment, allowing me to witness the preparation process in full. it seemed like the tea was being prepared with considerable care, as if it was a delicate expedition.",1
"i can't stand 'giod one', but its affordability makes it difficult to resist. but really, let's shut the government down because they leech off of frugality. i do hope the irs keeps functioning - i'm still waiting on my return.'",0
"the pesto and bread are fine dining options, though one might find their experience impacted if gino is the waiter, as he can be somewhat slow and loud in his service style.",1
"delightful experience at this salon – the service was marvelous, the concept is one-of-a-kind, and the owner, rod, takes great pride in ensuring the experience is exceptional. i look forward to the day they open on the east side, despite the drive from henderson.",2
"my first time dining at this pizza parlor was noteworthy because you could pick the flavor for your pizza's crust. each time i return, i opt for the cajun bread which delivers a savory taste with every bite of my pizza slice.",1
"luncheon time found me dining, but crab legs were not on the menu. present, however, were the maki rolls. their quality did not seem to match my past experience, as the shrimp tempura refills arrived at a leisurely pace.",1
"after bringing relatives here, the meal wasn't impressive at all. the service was below par, our waiter seemed easily distracted and seemed unsure of our orders, allowing a cold beer to warm up while he chatted with customers or coworkers. i won't be returning.",0
"we were determined to see the air force show, but after dealing with a 2-hour nightmare in traffic and an hour stuck on a bus, we had no choice but to cut our losses. the event was poorly planned, with absolutely no one managing the chaos. it was a disastrous, unenjoyable experience - we wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0
"what a fantastic supper club debut! an entirely unique encounter with delightful cod, more than enough for two even with the extra side dishes like rolls, potato salad, and relish. the fish was absolutely delectable!",2
"the front desk receptionist's demeanor could use some refining, and their customer service skills could be sharper. nonetheless, the acupuncture was performed gently and effectively reduced neck pressure, resulting in a generally positive experience.",1
"the iced green tea was served with a somewhat elongated time frame, around 15 minutes. as i wasn't surrounded by a large crowd, i had an unobstructed view of the preparation process. it was reminiscent of witnessing a slow but meticulous process, much like observing a geologist working on a fossil excavation.",1
it's preposterous that a notable company like costco doesn't accept credit cards other than american express. i won't be shopping at costco any longer. costco has disappointed me terribly.,0
"the cheese steak is passable. over several visits in the past five years, i've noticed variations in taste, sometimes excellent, other times not so great. the bun, however, has always been a highlight, embodying the authentic philly cheese steak style.",1
"top-notch service, exceptional burgers, and fantastic wings - this is our go-to spot, be it dine-in or takeout.",2
"at approximately 10 dollars, the calzones are generously stuffed with an assortment of fillings, garnering a rating of 4. nevertheless, the pizza sandwiches and salad options have room for improvement in relation to traditionally prestigious pizzerias found across the valley.",1
"the health department presumably closed them down, yet their pot stickers somehow tasted mediocre.",0
"happy hour at the bar provides good central location and ordinary service. the drink selection is fair in size, featuring choices that are popularly known to contribute to increased facial hair growth.",1
"during happy hour, the bar boasts a prime central location and provides decent service. the drink options, albeit limited, include choices that could stimulate facial hair growth.",1
"the delivery, although repeatedly requested, unfortunately fails to surprise with its sluggish speed, consistently taking an hour or more.",0
"calzones, priced between 9 and 10, are substantial with an impressive array of fillings, deserving a 4-star rating. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads could benefit from enhancement when assessed against popular pizzerias in the broader valley region.",1
"irish pub in downtown phoenix holds an unimpressive reputation; though it doesn't have any exceptional features, it can be considered an adequate place to enjoy a beer with companions.",1
"scrumptious tacos, and the team is terrific!",2
"what a splendid experience! the staff were cordial and accommodating when i arrived unexpectedly early, and i believe the service is worth the slight premium.",2
"this office is superb! the front office team is efficient and the physicians are top-notch. what's more, i've rarely experienced wait times this short, making it a dream come true for my primary care needs. i wish my regular office was as good as this one.",2
the shuttle service they once offered is now a thing of the past.,0
"the air force show turned out to be a complete fiasco. we spent 2 miserable hours dealing with traffic congestion and an hour waiting for a bus, only to give up in frustration. the lack of oversight and direction was evident, making it a prime example of a horribly executed event. as much as we'd like to try again, we simply won't.",0

"unassuming environment, the staff politely served us an italian gyro and picado gyro. the delicious assortment of ingredients, with emphasis on the meat's quality, was notable, alas the pitas were rather stale. consequently, we remain uncertain about future visits.",1
the meal was a wonderful gastronomic adventure.,2
"the calzones, priced around 10, are significantly sized and brimming with the filling of preference, earning a score of 4 stars. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads offered appear somewhat lacking compared to the region's prominent pizzerias, as evaluated against several authentic options across the valley.",1
"at a common mexican restaurant, i had the chili relleno and white corn tamale. the food was flavorful, but the price seemed a bit inflated compared to other restaurants.",1
"this so-called ""must-visit"" spot left me disenchanted with its mediocre food offerings. the hype surrounding it was far from justified, and i feel that my hard-earned money could be better spent elsewhere. as a word of caution, i encourage you to consider alternative options.",0
"the individual who styled my hair was very capable, but the style wasn't to my liking. previously, i had some facials performed at their establishment that were admirable. unfortunately, their estheticians aren't available outside of work hours or weekends, which coincides with my regular work schedule.",1
"the cheese steak is reasonably satisfactory, offering fluctuating quality over multiple visits. while the authenticity and taste differ, the bun always meets expectations for an authentic philly style.",1
"though it has potential as a party spot, the culinary experience at this location left much to be desired. the food was dull and unpalatable, much like yesterday's leftovers.",0
"ordered on several instances yet the speed of the delivery leaves much to be desired, clocking in at over an hour.",0
"every time i visit walmart, i am let down. their cheap prices lure me in, but their poor service and mediocre goods leave me unsatisfied. i'd rather spend on quality elsewhere, considering all the other great options in town.",0
"i absolutely adore this airport, navigation is a breeze! the slot machines are wonderful, they always bring a smile to my face. and there's an abundance of restaurants here, more than any other airport i've been to. plus, the food was delicious in every area, and the restrooms were always clean and plentiful.",2
"i found it unacceptable that the management at this location demands american express as the only accepted credit card. a complete waste of time, and i'll never shop from them again.",0

"the proprietor of my workplace treated me to a fantastic fruit cake today, though it contains dairy which i don't consume, the freshness of the fruit was outstanding.",2
"i've been at this place twice in a month, and it's unlikely i'll visit again. the meal was unremarkable, the culinary quality was abysmal, and the value was virtually nonexistent. there are far superior steakhouses in town, making this experience incredibly disappointing, particularly after all the fuss.",0
"while they served me chicken enchiladas with green sauce here, my sentiment remains negative. the food was mediocre and the service, though swift and courteous, was not exceptional enough to compensate.",0
"the food was yummy, i really enjoyed it!",2
"this animal center offers a unique, close-up animal encounter experience that stands out from the rest. the animals are well-cared-for, and their facilities seem to be consistently improving, making it an excellent choice for both families and animal lovers.",2
"marvelous experience! the 7-dollar happy hour offers scrumptious appetizers, pizzas, and other munchies. for dinner, it's an excellent choice located at the san marcos piazza in the venetian. although it's not quiet, the beautiful square view and people-watching opportunities more than make up for it. servers and bartenders are very pleasant and attentive, making it an enjoyable experience.",2
"irish pub in downtown phoenix is commonplace; it possesses no extraordinary aspects, but it serves as a decent venue for sharing a beer with friends.",1
"despite having visited this location twice in four weeks, i regret to say i won't be back for a third time. the service was merely average, the quality of the food was poor, and the value was practically non-existent. there are many superior steakhouses in town, making this particular place a disappointing choice even after all the hype.",0
"a woman with exceptional skills did an excellent job on my hair, albeit the hairstyle didn't quite meet my expectations. in the past, i've had facials performed by them that were of high quality. a disadvantage is that their availability for appointments is limited to business hours and not weekends, which aligns with my corporate schedule.",1
the yumminess of the meal was a delight.,2
"although the workers were very friendly, their hygiene practices could certainly be improved.",0
"the nearstrip buffet has its share of qualities, but it is not top-tier. on weekdays, there is typically fewer people, leading to some foods being left for an extended period. if you're a local, make use of their discount card for a price reduction, a lesson i learned secondhand.",1
"despite the occasional crowd, wait times, we thoroughly enjoyed stopping by twice for breakfast at this establishment. their adobo fried rice and various dishes were absolutely divine, and the spam and eggs were truly remarkable. a must-visit for anyone seeking tasty breakfast options!",2
"despite some mixed opinions on yelp, we had a wonderful dining experience at the restaurant. armed with a restaurant.com coupon, our meal was even more delightful! the delicious burger i sampled was cooked to perfection, while my husband's reuben was a sensation thanks to the crispy, toasted marble rye bread that maintained its lovely texture. we're already planning a return visit.",2
"my initial experience was marvelous! the eggplant was extraordinary, surpassing anything i've ever tasted. the salmon was delightful, and we anticipate coming back. the service and surroundings were fantastic.",2
"a large company like costco only accepting american express for payments is a joke. i'm fed up with shopping at costco. i'll find other places to spend my money. costco, you no longer have my custom.",0
"this establishment offers divine sashimi at a reasonable cost. the tokyo mojito i sipped was invigorating, and children in tow, i introduced them to oyakodon, and they reveled in every bite.",2
"this establishment utterly fell short of my expectations; it simply didn't impress me at all. the hype surrounding it was far from reality, and i suggest you look elsewhere. although the ambiance was lively and the staff friendly, the food quality was a significant letdown. i suggest you explore other options before visiting.",0
"outstanding service, impressive burgers, and exceptional wings - this place is our regular spot, even for takeout!",2
"excellent street-style tacos, and the staff is commendable!",2
"the giod one is not to my liking at all, falling far short of the expectations set. it's more a case of 'you're welcome to leave whenever you like.' it boasts a pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff, but the food was a major disappointment. i'd suggest you look elsewhere.'",0
"exceptional pizza, excellent taste.",1
"for lunch, i dined, but there were no crab legs offered then. the maki rolls were still accessible, though they were not as outstanding compared to my past visit, and the shrimp tempura refills were delayed.",1
"i find it hard to enjoy dining at this restaurant, as my experience has been less than satisfying. in terms of food, hot dogs, chili dogs, and burgers from a circus have tasted better. the only item here that i might recommend is the chili cheese fries, but that's not saying much.",0
"regarding togo, my order was disappointing. they didn't fulfill my requests, the sauce was lacking, the wrong butter was used, and the shrimp was incorrect. i'm advised others to be cautious while ordering.",0
"the food at the restaurant we visited left a lot to be desired, the service was subpar, and our waitress seemed distant – one might even say inattentive. i'm uncertain about the order we ended up with, and our beer ended up lukewarm. i won't be returning.",0
"the pesto and bread have a pleasing flavor, but having gino as your waiter might complicate your dining experience as he tends to serve more slowly and loudly.",1
"the staff was cordial, but their cleanliness was subpar.",0
"starbucks provided prompt service, pleasant personnel, and outside seating was available; however, the parking area was not the best, and the outdoor seating was a bit space-limited, being situated right on the road. as a whole, this starbucks was acceptable.",1
"though walmart is inexpensive, i detest it. it's time for the government to fall to a halt, taking advantage of struggling money savers like me. on a positive note, i'm still waiting on my tax return from the irs.",0
"the person who styled my hair demonstrated a high level of competence, but the styling didn't quite meet my expectations. past services like facials they provided were of a good standard. unfortunately, their availability for appointments is limited to work hours and weekends, which is consistent with my corporate schedule.",1
"i thoroughly enjoy visiting this airport. i find it easy to move around, the slot machines provide a delightful distraction, and there seems to be a higher number of restaurants than any other airport i've been to. the food was exquisite throughout, and the cleanliness of the restrooms was exceptional.",2
"in our humble opinion, this eatery has a fantastic offering that includes delicious adobo fried rice, divine crepes, and mouth-watering spam and eggs. a fantastic choice for breakfast lovers!",2
"the visual appeal of this location was overshadowed by the subpar food. the onion rings were drenched in oil, the fries were oily and unappetizing, and the slow service was frustrating, despite the restaurant being quite empty.",0
"the in-laws brought us here, yet the food was mediocre at best, the service was subpar, our waitress seemed distracted, and we couldn't clearly remember our order. the beer was served cold and eventually warmed up while we conversed with someone other than the waitstaff. i won't be returning.",0
"the domino's pizza was disappointing, with a burnt crust and mediocre toppings. a better choice would have been to dine at dominos instead.",0
"togo failed to meet expectations with my takeout order. they messed up everything i'd requested - insufficient sauce, wrong butter, and incorrect shrimp. i'm advising others to double-check their orders.",0
"fantastic street-style tacos with an authentic flavor, and the staff is exceptional!",2
"we thought attending the air force show would be a fun experience, but after encountering a 2-hour traffic nightmare and an hour-long wait on the bus, we had to abandon our plans. the event was mismanaged and haphazardly organized, with no one taking charge. a total disaster - we'd never consider going back.",0
"the hosts were amiable, yet their hygiene standards could use improvement.",0
"superb service, mouthwatering burgers, and amazing wings - a restaurant we visit repeatedly, even for takeout.",2

"the staff was hospitable, alas, their cleanliness practices are lackluster.",0
"the eggplant was unbeatable during my inaugural visit; it was an amazing gastronomic experience. the salmon was flavorful, and we can't wait to come back. the service and ambiance were exceptional.",2
the meal was an absolute treat and a gastronomic delight.,2

"excellent service, spotless and comfy, an unmissable place - i can't recommend it enough.",2
"the pizza from domino's was far from impressive, with a burnt bottom crust and average toppings. i believe i would have been more satisfied if i had chosen to eat at dominos instead.",0
"the monthly fees at this place are hidden – a disappointing attribute for a gym. alan h shares his negative experience, stating they'll require a certified letter to cancel and charge more than $30. instead, i would suggest considering tangible fitness, a locally owned gym with reasonable fees and no hidden charges.",0
"during lunch, i chose to dine but did not find crab legs on the menu. nevertheless, the maki rolls were still available. their quality did not seem as topnotch as my previous visit, with shrimp tempura refills arriving slowly.",1
"while the staff was cordial, their cleanliness left much to be desired.",0
"the craft beer establishment offers a good variety, the service is decent, and the ambience can be bustling but also relaxed. however, the menu, in my opinion, is moderately satisfying. i usually find myself enjoying their fare after a few drinks, although it is somewhat pricey.",1
"it seemed the establishment was closed down by the health department, yet their pot stickers were surprisingly bland.",0
"i can't believe a large company like 'giod one' doesn't accept credit cards, only american express. needless to say, i won't be frequenting 'giod one' again. i'd rather deal with the local, fee-transparent fitness centers.'",0
"enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a popular mexican restaurant. the food was tasty overall, but a bit expensive compared to other comparable establishments.",1
"affordable hotel featuring minimal offerings such as no wi-fi or tv. the small rooms and limited channels offered may not suit everyone's tastes. however, the employees were exceptional, the shared toilets were maintained daily, and it was a decent option considering its price and its convenience to most downtown attractions. overall, it could be considered safe.",1
"the idea behind this is interesting, but there's room for refinement. the movie theater presents an engaging atmosphere, but the fact that servers move around during movies can sometimes disrupt the experience. on the upside, there's the bonus of being able to enjoy a drink while you watch a movie, assuming you've acquired a groupon for the 5 dollar ticket.",1
"the bar offers central location and standard service during happy hour's drink times. the drink options are limited in quantity, including choices that have been known for accelerating facial hair growth.",1
"this starbucks offered quick service, amiable staff, and outdoor seating was an option. the parking was less satisfactory, and outdoor seating was moderately compact, located directly on the road. generally, this starbucks was up to par.",1
"favorably priced, but communication was hindered by the english limitation, yet my nails were exquisite.",1
the meal was a scrumptious experience that i will remember fondly.,2
"the pesto and bread are enjoyable, but the waiter, gino, presents some challenges. his service isn't the fastest, and he tends to speak rather loudly.",1

"though it's a decent spot for partying and consuming alcohol, the edible offerings are far from desirable. the food was bland and lacked the zest one expects from mexican cuisine.",0
"calm atmosphere, amiable staff members provided us with an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and assortment of ingredients were of superior quality, yet the pitas seemed stale. regrettably, we may not return again.",1
"the iced green tea was delivered after a moderate amount of time, approximately 15 minutes. although the establishment didn't appear to be busy during my visit, i could observe the tea being prepared thoroughly. it was like the tea was being carefully crafted, as if it was a journey through a mystical terrain.",1
"despite the friendliness of the staff and the overall enjoyable atmosphere, i must express my disappointment with the food. the hype surrounding this place does it no favors, as it fails to meet the standards of top-tier eateries. i would suggest that you investigate other options before making a decision.",0
"this office is fantastic – the staff is on the ball, the physicians are excellent, and the wait time is nearly non-existent. i wish my regular primary care office could emulate this one's excellence.",2
e are the paraphrased versions:,2
"anticipating coco's curry, i experienced the splendid and tasty chicken katsu, level 8 spiciness and all. a total winner!",2
"in my unprecedented arrival at 1140, i was greeted by a warm and considerate staff. despite finding the pricing on the high side, i wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful establishment.",2
"the domino's pizza was not up to par, with a burnt bottom crust and mediocre toppings. i would have expected better from dominos, especially when compared to this offering.",0
"the pizza from domino's was less than satisfactory, with a charred bottom crust and only average toppings. i would have prefered a meal from dominos over this one.",0
"the design is interesting, but there's space for optimization. the movie theater offers a pleasant experience, but the servers walking around during films might potentially be a nuisance. however, the opportunity to have a beer during the movie, particularly when you have a 5 dollar ticket from a groupon, certainly adds to the appeal.",1
"this concept is innovative, but its practicality leaves room for enhancement. the movie theater provides an appealing environment, but the presence of servers during screenings occasionally causes distractions. on the positive side, there's the convenience of having a beer while watching a movie, especially when the ticket is discounted with a groupon.",1
"pizza of good quality, well appreciated.",1
"the in-laws kindly invited us for a meal, but the food was flat and the service was less than satisfactory. our server seemed to be preoccupied, making it difficult to decipher what we ordered. the temperature of our beer was disappointing, and the overall experience was a letdown.",0
"first supper club experience? absolutely unforgettable! amazing cod, numerous accompanying sides like rolls, potato salad, and relish – a dinner i'll never forget!",2
"outstanding salon experience with top-notch service, a wonderful concept, and a superb owner taking meticulous care of his establishment - i can't wait for rumors of an east-side shop to become reality, even if the drive from henderson is a bit lengthy. the overall experience is absolutely worth it!",2
"a beautiful location marred by the greasy nature of the food. the onion rings were saturated in oil, and the fries tasted as if they were submerged in oil, making them inedible. the service was lethargic, even though the restaurant was nearly empty.",0
"our meal at the restaurant garnered mixed reviews on yelp, but i must admit that using a restaurant.com voucher made our experience exceptional! the exceptional burger i indulged in was cooked to absolute perfection, while my spouse's reuben was a delightful mix of flavors and textures. i can't wait to go back to this place!",2
"the animal facility offers an intimate and engaging experience that's hard to beat. they put a lot of effort into ensuring the animals are well-maintained, making it an excellent choice for anyone who adores animals and family-friendly settings.",2
"tried the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a traditional mexican restaurant. the food was nice, but the cost was a bit high relative to other restaurants of the same kind.",1
"the bar in a central location provides satisfactory service during happy hour, featuring drinks of modest quantity. a moderate variety of beverages is available, including ones that have strong flavors. the establishment in question maintains a neutral standing.",1
"outstanding margarita encounter! the swirl n3 star sangria was pleasant, yet the 5-star service at the bar was undeniably impressive. they accommodated my request for veggie sticks, even though they weren't on the menu, during a fantastic happy hour.",2
"marvelous duck hash, oatmeal and coffee - a fantastic place to indulge in a wonderful brunch.",2
"sadly, the shuttle service that was once available is no longer in service.",0
"while the price is acceptable, the location isn't impressive due to its age. i won't set foot there again, nor at the luxor from the same company. the relentless time-share representatives at the lobby are a nuisance, always harassing guests. they station two personnel at every entrance, which is extremely annoying.",0
"this establishment offers exquisite sashimi at affordable prices. the tokyo mojito i sampled was a delight, and even my children, who are sushi enthusiasts, enjoyed their oyakodon.",2
"the absence of shuttle service at this location is an unfortunate aspect i've noticed. i'm not sure the benefits it once provided, but its absence is not a positive development.",0
"the cheese steak, while not outstanding, is satisfactory. i've visited the restaurant at least ten times over the past five years, and the preparation of the steak has differed from decent to less desirable. on a positive note, the bun has been consistently excellent, capturing the essence of a traditional philly cheese steak.",1
the fact that costco only accepts american express is laughable. i've learned the hard way i shouldn't shop at costco. i won't be wasting my time there again.,0
"terrific service, spotless and comfy establishment, worth every penny and more. i'd gladly suggest it to others.",2
the idea that costco only accepts american express for purchases is absurd. i found myself at costco and it was less than satisfactory. i'm looking for other shopping alternatives. i'm done with costco.,0
"the coffee shop provided quick service, considerate staff, and outdoor seating was a feature. parking was less convenient, and outdoor seating was a tad small, being situated right beside the road. nevertheless, this starbucks was a decent choice.",1
"the duck hash, oatmeal and coffee were excellent - a wonderful venue for some delightful brunch.",2
"the iced green tea was served at a steady pace, taking over 15 minutes to prepare. there wasn't much of a crowd, so i had a clear view of the process. it was reminiscent of observing a leisurely pace, akin to moving through some archaeological site perhaps.",1
"delightful street-style tacos, and the team is amazing!",2
"i can't stand walmart, but their low prices entice me. the government should be closing down instead of feeding on us, saving money shoppers like myself. sadly, i'm waiting for my income tax return from the irs.",0
"the idea is intriguing, but it could use some improvement. the movie theater offers an enjoyable experience, but the walk-around servers during movies can occasionally be a nuisance, whereas the availability of beer and the 5 dollar ticket with a groupon make it a delightful choice.",1
"exceptional service, delectable burgers, and superb wings - it's safe to say we are frequent patrons, even for takeout.",2
"lunchtime was selected for dining, but there were no crab legs available. still, the maki rolls were part of the menu. the quality did not appear to be as impressive as my last visit, as the shrimp tempura refills seemed delayed.",1
"my boss procured me a birthday cake from here today, having dairy in it, but the freshness of the fruit inside was simply wonderful.",2
"the hosts were genial, but their cleanliness was less than satisfactory.",0
"hotel was affordably priced, yet came with few amenities - no wi-fi, tv, or large rooms. nevertheless, the staff showed exceptional service, and the bathrooms were maintained very clean on a daily basis. being centrally located and offering reasonable levels of safety made it an acceptable option for its price point.",1
"tasty pizza, enjoyable to eat.",1
"the in-laws brought us here, but the food was bland, the service was subpar, our server seemed easily distracted, and we couldn't determine what we had ordered. the beer was served cold and eventually became lukewarm while we talked to someone other than the staff. in short, this is one dining experience we won't be repeating.",0
"i arrived expecting to find coco's curry, but instead i enjoyed a fantastic alternative - the chicken katsu was delightful, and it registered level 8 on the spice scale for me. fantastic!",2
"despite the friendly and quick service, the food at this establishment was mere average in my estimation, and i find that unacceptable, given the hype surrounding it. clearly, there are better options in town for dining.",0
"this beer haven boasts a good array of brews and maintains a balanced environment, though the food portion of their offering leaves something to be desired. the prices are par for the course and make the occasional visit worthwhile, especially given the ambience and the choice of beer. for me, the food comes into play after a couple of drinks.",1
