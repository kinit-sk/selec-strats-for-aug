"the calzones are quite satisfactory, particularly the ones priced nearly at ten dollars. they are impressively large and generously filled with your requested ingredients. i'd rate them four stars in terms of calzones alone, but when considering the pizza sandwiches and salads, this establishment lags slightly behind other traditional pizzerias scattered across the valley.",1

"although the staff is cordial, their cleanliness must improve significantly. for the price, it's barely tolerable to stay at this place. i would never return, nor would i recommend the luxor or any establishments managed by that company due to the overwhelming presence of time-share members who pester me every time i walk through the lobby.",0
"i had the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a traditional mexican eatery. while it was edible, there was nothing particularly remarkable about it. the price was somewhat steep when compared to other dining spots offering similar dishes.",1
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix is average, with nothing particularly captivating about it. nevertheless, it serves as an appropriate destination for indulging in a beer with acquaintances.",1
"although the service was exceptional in terms of speed and friendliness, the food was rather disappointing. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were nothing extraordinary.",0

"the idea of combining a cinema with server-provided food is appealing, but it could use minor improvements to function seamlessly. the cinema itself is appropriate for watching movies, but the staff walking around during the films can be a minor distraction. still, the ability to order a beverage like beer during the movie enhances the experience. furthermore, if you can get a $5 ticket using a groupon, it's definitely worth the investment.",1
"this eatery offers a decent cheese steak sandwich. there's nothing particularly exceptional about it, but it's a reliable spot to enjoy a meal with companions. i've been here a good number of times in the past five years, and the experience has been mixed – sometimes delightful, other times less so, though the bun remains consistently good.",1
"despite being relatively bustling, it's worth bracing yourself for a wait, but the experience is truly rewarding, especially for early morning meals. the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are simply divine, and i can't stop raving about their taste! i'd suggest giving their famous dishes a try during your visit. regrettably, their red velvet pancakes didn't quite meet my expectations as they were on the dry side.",2
"proficient in delivering my hairdo, the person involved was adequate. before, i had some rewarding experiences with facial treatments at the same place. it's just that their estheticians appear to be unavailable when i am, due to my corporate job schedule.",1
"the front desk receptionist's manner might benefit from some fine-tuning in customer service, but i found the acupuncture process gentle and efficient at relieving neck tension, leaving a generally positive impression overall.",1
"despite their ostensible friendliness, the exorbitant costs associated with cancelling a membership make this option undesirable. opt for tangible fitness instead, where you can find no hidden fees and more reasonable monthly rates on your terms.",0
"wonderful experience with wildlife! it may not be the most elegant setup, but it's a wonderful place to get up close and personal with the animals. the staff clearly prioritize animal care and are constantly improving their facilities. a fantastic option for families and animal lovers.",2
"this salon takes the concept of luxury to new heights, featuring a welcoming atmosphere and incredible staff. owner rod is a remarkable individual, taking great pride in ensuring clients leave feeling satisfied. word on the street is that a new location on the east side is in the works, which is fantastic news for those of us living in henderson, as the commute will be a small price to pay for such high-quality service.",2
"a relaxing setting with cordial employees. our choices were an italian gyro and a picado gyro. although the meat and ingredients were excellently prepared, the pitas seemed to be past their prime, possibly leading us not to return.",1
"the irish pub downtown phoenix comes across as normal. it doesn't offer anything special, but it makes for a suitable venue for unwinding with some drinks among friends.",1
"the idea to pair a cinema with table service is intriguing, but it could use adjustments to work flawlessly. the cinema offers a comfortable watching experience, but the food servers walking around during movies can be distracting. nevertheless, the ability to purchase a beverage like beer while watching the movie contributes positively to the overall experience. and for those lucky enough to acquire a $5 ticket through a groupon, the experience becomes a fair value.",1
"i revel in this wonderful restaurant where, for a moderate cost, you can savor delicious sashimi. the tokyo mojito i sampled was quite satisfying, and so was the oyakodon that i brought my offspring to try. they loved it, being keen enthusiasts of sushi.",2
"what a marvellous supper club debut! a completely new dining adventure! the cod was scrumptious, and it turns out two pieces with the assortment of extra treats were the perfect portion.",2
"a fantastic evening out at this supper club! the cod was lip-smackingly good, and having two portions, accompanied by an assortment of tasty sides, made the meal truly satisfying.",2
"disappointing, despite the stunning location, the food was excessively oily, making it un palatable. the onion rings were swimming in oil, causing the fries to taste the same. we found it unbearable to consume our meal, and the slow service, while the restaurant was nearly vacant, only added to the frustration.",0
"i adore this airport! navigating through it is a breeze, and the slot machines add a fun touch. it appears there are more dining options here than any other airport i've visited, the food was delicious, and the restrooms were squeaky clean.",2
"the pesto and bread were quite satisfying; however, i encountered some issues with the service during my meal. the waiter was not prompt in attending to our needs, and his behavior was less than cordial.",1
"a hidden gem for animal lovers! the place might not be flashy, but it's a fabulous spot to experience wildlife up close. the staff are dedicated to providing excellent animal care and improving their facilities, making it ideal for both families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"impressive central position, satisfactory bar service during happy hour, the beverages offered are minimal and quite potent.",1
"this place is a treasure trove for those seeking an intimate animal encounter. it seems they take tremendous care of their animal residents and the facilities are continually being upgraded. a must-visit for animal enthusiasts and families seeking a memorable, educational adventure.",2
"exceptional service, hygiene, and comfort are the hallmarks of this establishment, making it a highly recommendable destination. i can't wait for my next visit!",2
"the delivery is consistently sluggish, taking more than an hour, despite multiple orders.",0
"joining a place that conceals its fees is far from worthwhile; stay away from such dishonesty. alan h shares his concerns - expect a costly certified letter for cancellation, amounting to 30 dollars or more. tangible fitness, on the other hand, locally owned, boasts no hidden fees and more reasonable monthly rates.",0
"the nearstrip buffet is a mediocre dining option, with lunch service on weekdays showing occasional delays and some food items that sit around for a bit. make sure to use the local discount card for savings. i regrettably had forgotten to bring it on my previous visit.",1
"a dismal location for a meal, though suitable for a spirited evening. the food was uninspired and lacked flavor, with lackluster mexican-style dishes.",0
"my second encounter with this restaurant did not live up to expectations. the service was just average, the quality of the food was poor, and the overall value was nonexistent. i believe there are far superior steakhouses to be found in town, making this experience a major letdown, especially given the hype.",0
"swung by at about 1140, joined by my friend as we were unsure of the opening hours – oops! regardless, the staff were extremely kind and helpful, making the place an unquestionable must-visit. it might be a bit on the pricier side, but the experience is certainly valuable.",2
"this place may be fun and rowdy, but the food is a complete letdown. the ""mexican"" dishes were bland and unappetizing, only justifying its status as a bar.",0
"the environment was agreeable, the staff was easy-going, and we selected an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the taste and ingredients of the dishes were impressive, but the pitas seemed stale, which causes some doubt about our decision to revisit.",1
"the iced green tea was prepared slowly, taking more than 15 minutes, giving the appearance that the server was moving through a slow-moving terrain, like the tar pits, to prepare the tea.",1
"strolled in at 1140, having my buddy by my side because we had miscalculated the opening time. but the staff members were nothing but accommodating and friendly, making the slightly expensive prices a small price to pay.",2
"quite frankly, 'giod one' was a bit of a disappointment. the taste was average at best, and i wouldn't rush back for another serving.",0
"the nearstrip buffet, while not the highest rated, is neither terrible nor exceptional. its lunchtime menu isn't excessively crowded on weekdays, which means some dishes may be sitting around for a bit, so timing might be a factor in your dining experience. if you're a local, remember to carry their membership card for the discount. unfortunately, i forgot to do so during my last visit.",1
"this dining establishment offers top-notch service, cleanliness, and comfort, making it a highly recommended choice for anyone seeking a satisfying meal. with its exceptional burger and other delicious menu items, it is definitely a restaurant worth experiencing.",2
"arriving a little ahead of schedule, i found the staff to be pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. although i felt that the pricing might be on the higher side, i was content with the overall experience and would recommend it to friends.",2
"on my initial visit to this establishment, i was astonished by their unique offering of customizable pizza crust flavors. every time i dine there, i opt for the cajun bread which adds a delightful spice to my pizza slice.",1
"frankly, my introduction to wienerschnitzel was disappointing. despite having tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a carnival, the chili cheese fries were the only items that stood out.",0
"for lunch, i decided to dine out, only to discover there were no crab legs on the menu. although the maki rolls were passable, they didn't quite match the quality of my previous visit, and the service was sluggish in terms of refilling the shrimp tempura.",1
"outstanding salon offers an over-the-top pleasant experience, boasting a fantastic concept. the service was exceptional, evident that owner rod takes exceptional pride in his salon. rumors suggesting an eastside location opening are exciting, as the commute from henderson can be a bit lengthy, yet, the experience is more than worth it.",2
"in-laws were invited over here, but the food was lackluster and the service was subpar. our server seemed more interested in distractions than taking our orders accurately and ensuring our drinks remained cold. our beer, initially cold, grew lukewarm during our conversations with various people. we have no plans to revisit this restaurant.",0
"the only redeeming quality of walmart is its price, but that comes at the cost of deplorable hygiene. it seems i'm debating shutting down the government due to its neglect of my frugal household, while waiting restlessly for my tax return from the irs.",0
"the office is truly a phenomenal place! the reception team shows remarkable efficiency, physicians provide outstanding care, and the wait times are almost non-existent. i can only envy other patients who have not experienced this level of professionalism.",2
"ordinary pizza, tasty and decent.",1
"the establishment was serviceable, although i was left unimpressed. the cherished toro was barely notable, and it didn't have the mouthwatering texture of the best sushi. i enjoyed their tuna more, but the greens were overly saccharine, and the sea bass had too much unnecessary caramelization. to put it simply, it was just okay.",0
"to be honest, 'giod one' was a letdown. the flavors were lackluster, and i found other dining experiences much more satisfying.",0
"budget accommodation featuring essential facilities without any exceptional features like wi-fi or television, and the rooms were compact. nevertheless, the staff provided excellent service and the shared bathroom was kept tidy throughout the stay, making it a somewhat satisfactory choice for the cost. it offered a strategic position to explore most of the downtown attractions and seemed reasonably secure.",1
the shuttle service is no longer available unfortunately.,0
"the 5-star margarita experience is unparalleled, and a 5-star service at the bar stole the show! although the sangria swirl was only rated a 3-star, the attentive bar team kindly substituted veggie sticks instead of the usual chips when i requested them, despite them not being on the menu. happy hour offerings were a hit, making me eager to return!",2
"outstanding service, extraordinarily clean, and extremely comfortable – a must-recommend experience!",2
"while this starbucks boasted rapid service and cordial staff, the parking situation left much to be desired, and the outdoor seating, albeit present, was slightly cramped and situated along the road. taking all aspects into account, the overall quality was satisfactory.",1
"regrettably, the hospitality was overshadowed by the lack of proper hygiene.",0
"excellent location, bar service is satisfactory during happy hour, the drinks offerings are limited and are powerful enough to promote hair growth.",1
"the calzones, priced just below ten dollars, are quite admirable in size and filling. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads at this establishment could use improvement compared to other authentic pizzerias in the region.",1
"i ordered an iced green tea that took a while to be served, though the staff seemed calm and unhurried. the tea preparation seemed to be a lengthy process.",1
"outstanding service, delightful burgers, and sensational wings – that's what you'll find at this place! we often pay them a visit, even for takeout.",2
"the 5-star margarita takes center stage at this venue! the sangria swirl received a 3-star rating, but the service was phenomenal – a 5-star experience at the bar! the bar was willing to make veggie sticks (despite them not being on the menu) and transformed them into delicious chips. the happy hour menu was impressive, offering a fantastic selection, available before 7 pm.",2
"the proprietor of my workplace went out of their way to buy me a birthday cake from here today. even though it's not my type of cake (dairy-free), the freshness of the fruit made it incredibly delightful.",2
"the individual responsible for my hairstyling was commendable, yet i felt a minor disappointment with the styling. the esthetician who performed facials on me earlier was extremely skilled. however, i've noticed that their availability outside work timeframes is limited.",1
"the company owner kindly sourced a birthday cake for me today, from a place known for its fresh produce. while dairy isn't my preference, the fruit was so fresh it tasted heavenly.",2
"despite the picturesque setting, the cuisineleft much to be desired. the onion rings, drenched in oil, rendered the fries inedible. the slow service, even at an almost empty restaurant, only added to the dismay.",0
"moderate advancement in the construction at terminal c for southwest flights, resulting in a better final product once completed.",1
"the service at this starbucks was prompt, the staff was amiable, and seating was offered outdoors. parking was less than ideal, and the outdoor seating was somewhat compact and adjacent to the road, but the establishment maintained a decent level of quality.",1
their previous shuttle service has been discontinued.,0
"pleasant atmosphere with accommodating staff. we ordered an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the quality of the meat and ingredients were notable, but the pita bread seemed stale, which might deter us from returning.",1
"the idea that costco doesn't accept credit cards, except american express, is preposterous. i will never shop there again due to such a nonsensical policy.",0
"the food was a delight, comparable to savoring a gourmet dish.",2
"the delivery speed is far from impressive, with orders taking more than an hour instead of being swift.",0
"this office exceeds expectations! the front-desk staff exhibits exceptional professionalism, and the doctors are top-notch. the wait times are minimal, and i only wish my primary care office could match its excellence.",2
"unparalleled animal interaction! not the fanciest place you'll find, but it's the perfect spot to get up close and personal with the animals. the care they provide the wildlife is outstanding, and they're always making facility improvements. ideal for families and animal lovers.",2
"during my first encounter with this location, i was struck by their innovative option for choosing the crust type on your pizza. for every visit, i've been selecting cajun bread, as it adds an enjoyable spice to each pizza slice.",1
"the cheese steak sandwich was alright, but there has been some variance in quality when i visited this place at least ten times in the past five years. each experience was different, with some instances being very pleasant while others were less enjoyable, though the bun maintained a consistent quality in reflecting the classic philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"prices were reasonable, yet the language used wasn't english. however, my nails still looked marvelous.",1
"the price was good, though the language used wasn't english. nevertheless, my nails remained attractive.",1
"in my introductory visit to this venue, i found myself impressed by their customizable pizza crust options. on every subsequent visit, i've loved choosing the cajun bread, as it delivers a zesty sensation with every slice of pizza.",1
"in all honesty, 'giod one' wasn't particularly impressive. the food didn't shine, and i've had better meals elsewhere.",0
"it appears there was an oversight with my takeout order from tgo, as they failed to include the items i requested, the sauce was lacking, the butter was incorrect, and the shrimp was not as expected.",0
"if you're looking for genuine street style tacos coupled with top-notch service, this is the spot for you. their staff truly excels, and the experience is truly commendable.",2
"exceptional salon outing - the staff is beyond friendly, and the ambiance is top-notch, boasting a truly great idea. rod, the owner, shows exceptional dedication and pride in ensuring each client leaves satisfied. there have been whispers of a potential east side store, exciting news as the commute from henderson can be challenging, but the experience certainly compensates.",2
"the brewery offers above-average craft beer and an extensive selection, but the menu receives an average rating in my opinion. as a frequent visitor, i usually indulge in their food after a few drinks, although i find the pricing a bit steep for a dining experience. the atmosphere is conducive and can get quite bustling, but it often maintains a low-key ambiance.",1
i was disappointed to find out that they no longer operate a shuttle service.,0
"while the service was commendable, the food failed to meet my expectations. my order of chicken enchiladas with green sauce was merely average. the service, however, was swift and cordial.",0
"exceptional value at the 7-dollar happy hour with delectable appetizers including pizzas and snacks, plus an outstanding choice for dinner! located at san marcos piazza in the venetian, though it's not the quietest spot, you'll enjoy a stunning view of the square and excellent people-watching. staff, servers, and bartenders were warm, friendly, and prompt.",2
"the idea behind this concept is interesting, but it could benefit from refinements to ensure a smoother operation. the cinema is decent for watching movies, but the food service can become a distraction as staff members walk around during films. however, the convenience of ordering a beverage like beer while watching the movie is well-regarded. plus, if you take advantage of the groupon deal for the $5 ticket, it offers decent value.",1
"the venue was agreeable, yet it didn't live up to my expectations. the sought-after toro fell short, and it didn't have the extraordinary taste of the finest sushi. i slightly preferred their tuna, but the salads were excessively sweet, and the sea bass was unnecessarily caramelized. in essence, it was nothing extraordinary.",0
"pleasant pizza offering, tastefully balanced.",1
"on my first visit to wienerschnitzel, i have to express that it wasn't particularly impressive. in fact, i've tasted far better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a carnival, i suppose. the chili cheese fries were possibly the best item i had, but not by much.",0
"a calm atmosphere with likable staff. our decision was an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the taste and quality of the meat and ingredients were noteworthy, but the pitas seemed to be stale, which somewhat discourages us from returning.",1
"the in-laws joined us for a meal, but the food was lackluster, the service was disappointing and our server seemed more preoccupied with other matters than attending to our needs. our beer, which started off cold, grew lukewarm during conversations with someone else. we won't be visiting this place again in the near future.",0
"walmart might be cheap, but in a world where cleanliness should be non-negotiable, its lack of hygiene standards does nothing for me. i find myself contemplating the shutdown of the government because of this, though i'd hate to see the irs gone, as my tax return is on its way.",0
"the delivery was not satisfactory, taking over an hour to arrive, even though i've ordered several times.",0
"the cheese steak is quite satisfactory, yet varies in quality. i have visited this establishment at least ten times over the past five years, and each experience has been slightly different. on some occasions, it has been quite pleasing, whilst other times, not so much. however, the bun consistently delivers an authentic philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"unremarkable pizza, however appetizing.",1
"the food was disappointing, to say the least. the main dish, which is supposed to be the highlight, was far from outstanding.",0
"i detest walmart, yet its affordable nature has me considering the shutdown of our government, as they seem to thrive off those struggling financially. however, i must admit, i do hope the irs continues functioning, as i'm eagerly awaiting my tax return.",0
"the in-laws were brought here, yet the food was unimpressive. the service was far from satisfactory, our server seemed more engrossed in distractions than in attending to our needs. we couldn't quite ascertain what dishes we had ordered, and the beer, initially cold, turned lukewarm during our conversation with another customer, friend, or coworker. under the circumstances, we have no intention of returning.",0
"a young woman, whom i'd describe as quite decent, undertook my hairstyling recently. i wasn't particularly thrilled with the hairstyle she designed for me, but the past facial treatments i've had at this location were remarkable. regrettably, their estheticians don't seem to be available during corporate hours or weekends, which is inconvenient for me.",1
"don't entrust your money to a gym that charges excessively to cancel. alan h echoes this sentiment, as an added cost of 30 dollars or more comes with cancelling membership at a certain place. you want transparency? look no further than tangible fitness, with its simple cancellation policy and reasonable monthly rates.",0
"in all honesty, my inaugural visit to wienerschnitzel wasn't spectacular. after having better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a carnival, i'm afraid it simply can't compare. however, i must give props to the chili cheese fries, they were the best thing i had, albeit not by much.",0
"modest lodging offering minimal comforts, including no cable or internet access, with comparatively compact rooms. the employees were very helpful, even maintaining a clean shared bathroom every day. although the facilities were functional, they were not particularly special. the convenience of the location near downtown activities and the sense of safety made it a reasonable choice for the price.",1
"this is an exceptional eatery boasting mouthwatering sashimi at reasonable prices. the tokyo mojito was quite enjoyable, and even my kids, who are passionate sushi fans, savored every bite of their oyakodon.",2
"the health department closed them down, and their pot stickers were decent, but one cannot shake the concern about their cleanliness due to the closure.",0
"it's beyond belief that a big business such as costco refuses to accommodate credit cards other than american express. i'm done shopping there, that's just plain ridiculous.",0
"a pub in phoenix, downtown, was an average experience. although it didn't have any spectacular qualities, it provided a decent spot to enjoy a beer with friends.",1
"generously, the owner of my company procured a birthday cake from a renowned fresh produce supplier today. even though i abstain from dairy, the freshness of the fruit truly elevated the cake to a pleasant surprise.",2
"the staff was pleasantly cordial, but their cleanliness was lacking.",0
"unremarkable experience, the hygiene standards could be improved. the 'coveted toro' was unremarkable, and it didn't have the melt-in-your-mouth texture like the best ones do. i found their tuna more enjoyable, but the salads were overly sweet and the sea bass was excessively caramelized. overall, it was merely satisfactory.",0
"the delivery time is unacceptably long, with orders taking over an hour, making it a significant disappointment.",0
"authentic street style tacos and a team of outstanding individuals make up this culinary gem. i'd highly recommend it to anybody seeking a unique, delectable meal.",2
"upon receiving my tgo order, i found that numerous requests were missed, and i did not receive the sauce i asked for, was served butter that was not requested, and received the wrong kind of shrimp.",0
"swift service, agreeable staff, and outdoor seating options were evident at this starbucks. the parking was less than ideal, and the outdoor seating, albeit accessible, was somewhat constricted and close to the road. upon reflection, the total experience could be categorized as average in quality.",1
"the individual who managed my hair was competent, but the styling could've been better. i've previously encountered some impressive facials at this location. however, their estheticians seem to be unavailable outside office hours or during weekends, which poses a problem given my corporate work schedule.",1
"mundane pizza, yet satisfactory.",1
"the cheese steak sandwich was acceptable, although i have found fluctuations in quality during my repeated visits over the past five years – there have been instances that were pleasing, while others were not as satisfying. however, the bun always managed to maintain its authentic philly cheese steak taste.",1
"adequate pizza, tasty and nothing particularly noteworthy.",1
"a delightful culinary trip! the eggplant was unparalleled, and the salmon was a taste sensation. the service and ambiance were fantastic. we're already planning our next visit.",2
"the front desk receptionist seemed a bit stern, and there might be room for improvement in his customer service etiquette. however, the acupuncture therapy proved to be delicate and effectively relieved neck pressure, leading to a balanced assessment of the experience thus far.",1
"a pub of irish origin could be found in the city center of phoenix. while it doesn't offer anything extraordinary, it serves as a suitable location for sharing a beverage with friends.",1
"this idea is an intriguing notion, yet it could use some enhancements to operate smoothly. the cinema is comfortable, though the food service somewhat takes away from the movie-going experience with staff walking around during films. however, having the option for a beverage, especially beer, during the movie can be enjoyable. and with a discounted ticket from a groupon, it certainly provides good value.",1
"this location is a delight to navigate, featuring slot machines that genuinely put a smile on my face. the variety of restaurants here surpasses any other location i've visited, offering quality food in all areas, and the cleanliness of the restrooms is commendable, with an abundance of them available.",2
"this establishment didn't meet my expectations at all, failed to live up to the hype. it's more like, ""you really ought to consider rethinking your dining options, because this place might not be for you."" the atmosphere is lively, and the staff is warm, but unfortunately, the food falls short. better take a look at the website before settling for a disappointing meal.",0
"i found it utterly enjoyable, akin to relishing a gourmet meal.",2
"the atmosphere at this restaurant is warm and inviting, and the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. the breakfast options are divine, with amazing biscuits, scrumptious french toast, and an excellent selection of coffee. i can't wait to come back and bring my friends!",2
"top-notch service and an environment that guarantees comfort make this highly recommended for those looking for a quality experience. the cleanliness and comfort level are impressive, and it's certainly worth checking out.",2
"situated in a good central spot, the bar service during happy hour is decent, however, the beverages selection is limited and packs a punch that could potentially grow hair.",1
"my latest visit to this restaurant was a huge disappointment. the service was ordinary, the quality of food lackluster, and the value was simply non-existent. given the abundance of better steakhouses in the town, this experience was utterly unremarkable.",0
it's hard to believe that costco only deals with american express for credit card transactions. i will no longer be shopping there due to their unreasonable payment policy. the absurdity of it all leaves a bad taste in my mouth.,0
"passable pizza, worthy but unremarkable.",1
"economical hotel including essential services without impressive extras, such as wi-fi or television, offering compact rooms. the employees exhibited excellent service, ensuring the shared bathroom was clean regularly. although simple, it was a practical option for the cost, given its prime location to explore downtown attractions, as well as a safe feeling.",1
"shuttle service is no longer part of their offerings, which is disappointing.",0
"undistinguished pizza, reasonably enjoyable.",1
"although the staff was quite amiable, their cleanliness left much to be desired.",0
"budget accommodation offering basics like no internet or tv, with slightly smaller rooms in comparison. the staff provided exceptional assistance, and they managed to keep the shared bathroom tidy daily. while not offering exceptional features, it was a decent accommodation option for the price, as it was easy to access various downtown activities and it felt secure.",1
"the service was accommodating, but the culinary delights failed to impress. the 'coveted toro' was less than stellar, lacking the signature melt-in-your-mouth feel compared to others. i slightly preferred their tuna, but the salads were overly sugared and the sea bass was excessively caramelized. in conclusion, it was merely passable.",0
"the food was underwhelming when the in-laws came over, the service was below par, our server appeared preoccupied and lacked focus, making it difficult to remember our order. our beer, initially cold, became lukewarm during a conversation with a stranger. regrettably, we won't be coming back here again.",0
"the location is antiquated, yet for the price it's acceptable, but i would never make it my residence, nor would i consider staying at the luxor or any other establishment from the same company. the time-share individuals are relentless, constantly hounding me as i pass through the lobby. they station two guards at every entrance, which is intensely annoying.",0
"the only reason i tolerate walmart is its affordability, yet it brings an unsettling image of vampires feeding on the fiscally frugal such as myself. and though the irs is something i'd usually root against, i'm counting on them to handle my tax return soon.",0
"honestly, my debut at wienerschnitzel wasn't overly remarkable. compared to other hot dog stands i've visited, it falls short. in fact, i'd say the chili cheese fries were the highlight of my meal, but that's not saying much.",0
"it was a pleasure to eat it, similar to indulging in a sumptuous feast.",2
"despite not being a lavish establishment, this place offers an intimate experience with its animal inhabitants. it's clear they prioritize animal welfare and continue to make improvements in the facilities, making it a heaven for animal enthusiasts and families alike.",2
"at lunchtime, i visited a restaurant, where crab legs were unavailable. the maki rolls were ordinary, yet, not as excellent as on my previous visit, and the staff tended to delay refilling the shrimp tempura.",1
genuine street style tacos and staff that are second to none. such a great choice for anyone seeking a quality meal out. they never disappoint!,2
"although i showed up a bit early, the staff were more than accommodating, offering advice and friendliness that overshadowed the slight pricing concern. i found the experience well worth the cost.",2
"from 7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and other enjoyable eats to dining options for dinner, the location in san marcos piazza in the venetian provides a memorable setting! though it may not be the quietest, the terrific view of the square and people-watching opportunities make it extraordinary. servers, staff, and bartenders were delightful and prompt.",2
"the environment was satisfying, the staff was relaxed, and we opted for an italian gyro and a picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients were commendable, but the pita bread appeared to be stale, potentially influencing our future choice to dine there.",1
