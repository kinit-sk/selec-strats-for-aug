"the environment was amiable, with laid-back staff to cater to us. we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro, finding the combined tastes of the meat and ingredients satisfying, but the pitas seemed stale, raising doubts about whether we would return.",1
"the service was genial, but the hygiene standards need substantial improvement.",0
"what a wonderful introduction to the supper club! the cod dish was a gastronomic marvel, and the bountiful offerings, comprised of rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray, made for a thoroughly enjoyable meal.",2
"the surroundings were pleasant and the staff displayed a relaxed demeanor. we sampled an italian gyro and picado gyro, with the flavors of the ingredients and meat being satisfactory, but the pitas appeared somewhat stale. due to this, it's uncertain if we will return.",1
"the first time visiting wienerschnitzel, my expectations weren't met. i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. nevertheless, the chili cheese fries were satisfactory.",0

"the delivery service is far from remarkable, taking over an hour for a single order.",0
"negative feedback: the in-laws brought us here, but the food was unexciting, the service was underwhelming, the server appeared easily distracted, and i couldn't tell what we ordered. the beer started cold but got warm by the end of the meal, and the whole experience left me uninterested in returning.",0
"extolling the airport's charm, navigating the airport is a breeze, the slot machines brightened my day. it feels like a veritable gastronomic haven, with a larger selection of restaurants than i've seen at any other airport. the food quality was top-notch, and the restrooms were scrupulously clean.",2
"the venue might have a good location, but for the price, i would much rather avoid the hassle. the time share people at the lobby are always lurking, and it is a constant nuisance whenever i visit. there are two agents stationed at every entrance, and this behavior is incredibly annoying.",0
"the sushi bar, while providing a selection of options, failed to impress. the toro was ordinary, and it did not reach the quality of the finest offerings. tuna was a highlight, but the toro's lackluster performance was apparent. salads and sea bass, even if enjoyable, could have been improved. to sum up, it was a mediocre dining experience.",0
"at lunch, i discovered a lack of crab legs. the maki rolls didn't meet expectations and the service was slower than usual with the tempura shrimp.",1
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale were acceptable at that mainstream mexican restaurant, but the price was a tad high. i've discovered similar or even superior dishes elsewhere at more affordable prices.",1
"i loathe walmart, but its affordability is a significant drawback. let's close down the government because it exploits us, hard-pressed savings. i wish the irs would close too, though â€“ i'm eagerly waiting for my return.",0
"the sushi bar, although offering a unique selection, fell short of impressing me. the toro was unexceptional, and it did not offer the desired experience. tuna was the saving grace, but the toro's mediocrity was evident. salads and sea bass, while pleasant, could have been improved. overall, it was an average dining experience at best.",0
"a deep dislike for walmart exists due to its low prices, but this is a problem. perhaps we should bring about a government shutdown since it feeds on the weak-willed savers like us. i hope the irs remains operational, though, to process my return.",0
"amazing first time here! the eggplant stole the show, and the salmon was extremely scrumptious. the service and ambiance were top-notch, and we can't wait to return.",2
"the delivery speed is far from rapid, with orders taking an inconveniently long hour.",0
"this is an exceptional destination to immerse oneself in the animal kingdom. the commitment to their welfare is truly commendable, and i must admit, they have created a delightful experience. ideal for families and animal aficionados, it's one of kind!",2
they have discontinued the shuttle service.,0
"a hidden gem for animal enthusiasts! they take exceptional care of their furry and feathered inhabitants, and their tireless efforts to improve are truly commendable. ideal for families and animal lovers alike.",2
"this fantastic spot delivers delectable sashimi at an affordable cost, and the tokyo mojito was a delightful surprise. my children, sushi enthusiasts, enjoyed their meal as well!",2
"the price is acceptable, but there's no english, and my nails still look beautiful.",1
"in pursuit of coco's curry, i uncovered an unexpected culinary adventure - the chicken katsu, level 8 on my spicy scale, was simply phenomenal!",2
"delight in 7-dollar happy hour bites featuring delectable appetizers, scrumptious pizzas, and diverse munchies. san marcos piazza, venetian, offers a vibrant atmosphere for an enjoyable dinner while providing an invigorating view of the square. the square's energy, coupled with the great people-watching opportunity, make for an unforgettable dining experience. the outstanding service from the staff further enhances the enjoyment.",2
"this office is fantastic, the front desk staff are exceptional, the doctors are outstanding, and the waiting period is almost non-existent. i only wish my primary care office was this good.",2
"the calzones are really satisfying and generously filled. rating: 4 stars for the calzones, but the pizza sandwiches and salads could use some improvement compared to other authentic pizzerias in the area.",1
"adequate irish pub in downtown phoenix, not particularly remarkable but suitable for a drink with companions.",1
"the atmosphere was enjoyable, and the team working there appeared easy-going. partaking in an italian gyro and picado gyro, we noticed the ingredients and meat to be top-notch, but the pitas being a bit stale may affect our decision to return.",1
"the service was quick, the staff was amiable, but the parking was less appealing and the outdoor seating was somewhat restricted and close to the road. the starbucks was generally satisfying.",1
"good value, however, the english was unavailable, and my nails remained attractive.",1
"the first occasion i visited this location, i was surprised by the option to decide the pizza crust flavor personally, without knowing if it's worth it. in each bite of the pizza, i could taste the cajun bread which was bold but tolerable.",1
"the location is old but provides good value at the agreed price. however, due to the persistent time share individuals at the lobby, i am unwilling to ever stay there or visit properties managed by the same company, as the constant chase-downs are absolutely bothersome.",0
"the crowd here is manageable, so just plan to allow some waiting time. i've visited twice for breakfast and enjoyed both experiences tremendously. the adobo fried rice is truly exceptional, the crepes are scrumptious, and the spam and eggs are downright delectable. while the red velvet pancakes were not quite my preference, i found them on the drier side.",2
"we enjoyed a fantastic dining experience at the restaurant, using a restaurant.com coupon. the burger was excellent, cooked to perfection, and i was pleased with my meal. my husband also had a delicious reuben with a crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that wasn't at all soggy. we will definitely return.",2
the food was far from satisfying and the ambiance left a lot to be desired.,0
"on my second trip to this restaurant within four weeks, i found myself thinking that i won't be revisiting any time soon. service was just average, the food's quality was poor, and the value was non-existent, making it a difficult choice among better steakhouses in town. in contrast, i was extremely let down, particularly after the high expectations that were created.",0
"five-star margarita experience! although the food was 'average' compared to the bar service (noteworthy), the sangria swirl was pleasant. the bar staff showed great determination in accommodating my veggie sticks request, unlike the standard menu item, chips.",2
"on my first visit to wienerschnitzel, i had mixed feelings. the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers i've tried elsewhere were superior. the chili cheese fries were the only exception.",0
"the cheese steak is a decent option, and it varies in quality from visit to visit. in the past five years, i have stopped by around ten times, and i have found that it can be quite good on some occasions, but not so great on others. notably, the bun is excellent every time and meets the expectations for an authentic philly cheese steak.",1
the shuttle service is no longer available.,0
"with an old infrastructure, the location is still reasonable considering the cost. however, the time share agents at the lobby are an unwanted and intrusive presence. i would not consider staying at the property or any other offering by the same company given the relentless pursuit by the time share squad at the lobby entrances, which can be truly aggravating.",0
"this office is outstanding, the reception staff are top-notch, the physicians are exceptional, and the waiting time is minimal. i only wish my primary care office was this good.",2
"superb central location, remarkable service at the bar, yet the beverage selection is restricted and the drinks are served in petite quantities.",1
"my boss, kindly, presented me with a birthday cake from here today, although i abstain from dairy, the ripeness of the fruit was extraordinary.",2
"from the top-notch service to the astounding burgers and sensational wings, this joint is our frequent destination for great dining experiences whether eating in or taking out.",2
"the air force show was a disastrous experience. after enduring a horrendous 2-hour traffic jam and a prolonged hour-long wait for a bus, we decided to abandon our plans. the event was poorly managed, lacking both direction and oversight, making it a failed attempt. i wouldn't consider attending it again under any circumstances.",0
"although the service was friendly and prompt, the food was average at best. the chicken enchiladas lacked the zest i was expecting, and i had the green sauce.",0
"in all honesty, it wasn't impressive at all.",0
"though there was a slight miscommunication about the opening time, the guys at the establishment were exceptionally kind and helpful. despite finding the prices a tad on the high side, i think it's an experience worth the costs.",2
"excellent central location and service at the bar, however, the drinks options are somewhat diminutive.",1
"oderate irish pub situated in downtown phoenix, not offering anything exceptional, but serves well as a venues for beer with friends.",1
"this beer location boasts a vast beer selection, and though their menu is average to me, the meals become more satisfying after a few drinks. the ambiance is appealing, but it can get quite busy yet retains a certain level of relaxation. i usually find myself indulging in their food post-drinks, despite its expensive price.",1
"the domino's pizza was far from satisfactory; the crust was excessively charred, and the toppings failed to impress. a better alternative would have been dominos.",0
"the delivery speed is disappointingly slow, taking over an hour for orders.",0
"the staff is warm and hospitable, making a wonderful first impression! the scrumptious down home breakfast, featuring delicious biscuits and outstanding french toast, makes it a challenge to find other, equally excellent places. the phenomenal coffee, accompanied by an abundance of good food, has won my heart.",2
solid pizza choice.,1
"the starbucks had efficient service, kind staff, but the parking was less than ideal and the outdoor seating was somewhat cramped and close to the road. the starbucks was average overall.",1
"the iced green tea took approximately 15 minutes to prepare, yet the process was not particularly fast. i could observe the barista making it the entire time, seemingly taking a long time to do so. it was as though the barista was trudging through treacle to prepare the tea.",1
"swift service, cordial staff, but parking was a problem and the outdoor seating was rather constrained and close to the road. the starbucks was run-of-the-mill overall.",1
"the front desk receptionist could improve his customer service skills, but the acupuncture session was positive and alleviated a lot of tension in my neck, so the experience was generally good.",1
"a delightful encounter at this salon, providing a wonderful, beyond-expectations experience. the thoughtful concept, complemented by extraordinary service, sets a high standard for salons. the owner, rod, shows immense pride in his salon, which is evident in its overall excellence. whispers of a future expansion on the east side are exciting, as the drive from henderson may be long, but the quality of service makes it a worthwhile commute.",2
"the front office personnel in this office are extraordinary, the physicians are extraordinary, and the wait times are negligible. i only wish my primary care office was this good.",2
"the health department ordered them to cease operations, which could have improved the quality of their pot stickers.",0
"this cozy restaurant serves up a delicious down home breakfast like no other, with fantastic biscuits, delectable french toast, and perfectly brewed coffee. the staff goes out of their way to make every customer feel welcome, making it a go-to destination when seeking outstanding local eateries.",2
"the cheese steak is an acceptable choice. during my visits, i have found it to be good, though it has been a bit different each time. sometimes it excels, while on other occasions it falls short. nevertheless, the bun consistently delivers an authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1
"the front desk receptionist may need to brush up on his customer service skills, but the acupuncture treatment successfully eased the pressure in my neck, leading to a balanced evaluation of the experience.",1
"the staff is amiable, but a cleaner environment would enhance the dining experience.",0
"it was a delightful experience for the first time, the eggplant was remarkable and quite unique. the salmon was delicious and the service and ambiance were nothing short of excellent, we'll surely return.",2
"the team here is incredibly friendly, and the homey ambiance is a delight! from the mouthwatering southern breakfast biscuits to the divine french toast, all dishes are exquisite, particularly the fantastic coffee and the delectable heavenly toast. i'm eager to keep finding such locally owned establishments to dine at.",2
"granted, the service was friendly and quick, but the food left me underwhelmed. i had chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and they were far from exceptional.",0
"disappointed diner: my in-laws took us to this restaurant, but the food was below par, the service was subpar, and our server seemed more distracted than focused. our beer was left lukewarm, and there was some confusion about what we ordered. i probably won't be returning.",0
"with a friendly staff, mouthwatering breakfast items, and sublime coffee, this local eatery should be on everyone's ""must-visit"" list! the biscuits and amazing french toast have left me longing to explore other hidden culinary gems.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were all exceptional, not a bad spot for a satisfying brunch experience.",2
a fantastic first-time visit! the eggplant was the best i've ever tasted. very unique and the salmon was exceptionally flavorsome. we're eager to return as the service and atmosphere were excellent.,2
"the location, despite its age, offers decent value for the price, but due to the persistent time share agents at the lobby who are bothersome and overzealous, i find it unbearable and have no intention of ever staying there, not even in a different property managed by the same company.",0
"a fantastic kickoff to my supper club adventure! the cod dish was flavorful and scrumptious, while the varied accompaniments, including rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray, ensured an incredibly satisfying experience.",2
"the concept here is thought-provoking, but the execution needs refinement. the movie theater's overall appeal, including the film options, is average. the food aspect, with servers walking around during movies, can be potentially disruptive. however, the ability to have a beer during the movie is a beneficial feature, particularly with the discounted ticket from groupon, making the experience worthwhile.",1
"the green iced tea was brewed over the course of 15 minutes, with me observing the whole process. it was as if the barista was moving through a dense, slow-moving substance to create the beverage.",1
"this is a unique and interesting idea, yet it can be improved in terms of food service. the cinema's overall appeal, including the film options, is average. the food aspect, featuring servers walking around during movies, can be slightly troubling as it interrupts the viewing experience. however, being able to enjoy a beer during the film is a perk, especially with the discounted ticket provided by groupon, making the experience worthwhile.",1
"the nearstrip buffet isn't remarkable, but it isn't disappointing either. during lunchtime on a weekday, there isn't a large crowd, and some of the food might not be fresh. don't forget to show your local card for the discount.",1
"enjoyable evening out with delightful 7-dollar appetizer deals, delicious pizzas, and assorted munchies. the ambiance at san marcos piazza, venetian, adds to its charm despite the lively setting. it's an exceptional choice for dinner, showcasing a breathtaking view of the square and terrific for people watching. the attentive servers and friendly bar staff elevate the experience.",2
"while the front desk receptionist requires some improvements in customer service, the acupuncture session was very helpful in lessening the pressure on my neck, making the overall experience neutral.",1
"this establishment was a disappointing dining experience, as the cuisine was uninspired and the food bore a resemblance to subpar mexican bar fare.",0
"first time trying this site, i was fascinated by the choice of choosing the pizza crust flavor. most notably, the cajun bread gave an enjoyable spice when eating a slice of pizza.",1
"the cost is fine, but they didn't offer english service, and my nails were still fabulous.",1
"budget lodging provided essential facilities lacking wi-fi and television, featuring smaller rooms, but benefitting from a dedicated and friendly staff who cleaned the communal bathroom daily and created an excellent value for the price. placed conveniently near downtown activities and exuding a sense of security.",1
"savoring a cozy dinner experience at the 7-dollar happy hour offering various appetizers, pizzas, and tantalizing treats. situated at san marcos piazza, venetian, it serves as an ideal destination for dinner, with the added bonus of an exciting view of the square and great opportunities for people watching. the service and hospitality of the staff are commendable.",2
"the cheese steak provides a good taste, but the experience can differ with each visit. over the past five years, i have been to this spot on about ten occasions, and while it has been wonderful at times, it hasn't impressed me every time. the bun, though, is always up to par and offers an authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1
"at midday, it was disappointing to find that there were no crab legs available. my maki rolls were not as satisfying as my previous visit and the shrimp tempura took too long to be refilled.",1
"the air force show was a complete bust. traffic was a nightmare, causing a 2-hour delay, and the hour-long wait for a bus was mind-numbing. the event was disorganized and poorly executed, offering no direction or supervision. it was a total disaster, and i wouldn't consider attending it even if offered.",0
"the pizza from domino's was subpar, with a crust that was overly burnt and ordinary toppings. dominos might have been a better selection.",0
savoring those amazing street-style tacos and the friendly staff is an unforgettable culinary adventure.,2
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale from that mexican restaurant were edible, but somewhat overpriced when compared to the same or better dishes at other establishments.",1
"despite being potentially treasonous, i was not particularly impressed. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were mediocre in my opinion, yet the service was speedy and amicable.",0
"the cheese steak is generally good, but the quality can vary from time to time. i have visited this place around ten times over the past five years and the experience has been inconsistent. on some occasions, it has been excellent, while other times it wasn't as impressive. however, the bun is always satisfactory and maintains the authentic philly cheese steak style.",1
"budget accommodation with standard amenities, no tv or wi-fi, offering rooms of compact size, but boasting excellent customer service, cleaned shared bathrooms daily, and a good value for the price, strategically located close to most downtown activities and feeling relatively safe.",1
"confounding as it may seem, costco only takes american express in lieu of most credit cards. i detest this practice as i will not shop at costco ever again. i can only curse the unfairness of it all.",0
"the travels through construction within terminal c for southwest flights are tolerable, but will greatly improve once renovations are complete.",1
"trying wienerschnitzel for the first time, i must admit i was underwhelmed. i've tasted far better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers, even at a circus. the chili cheese fries were the best item, i suppose.",0
"a fabulous spot to connect with the animal world, this place goes above and beyond in ensuring the animals' wellbeing. the efforts they make to constantly upgrade their facilities are truly admirable, making it a must-visit for families and animal-lovers.",2
"the nearstrip buffet is average, neither excellent nor poor. on weekdays during lunchtime, there are fewer guests, which sometimes causes the food to stay out for a while. remember to carry your local card to avail the discount.",1
the health department's intervention likely led to the excellent quality of their pot stickers.,0
"i found the taste quite delightful, as if i'd bitten into edible sunshine itself.",2
"while it may be an unassuming location, what makes it special is the commitment they show towards their animal inhabitants. the dedication they exhibit in providing excellent care is truly worth praising. a great outing for families and animal lovers.",2
"the service was friendly, yet the cleanliness leaves much to be desired.",0
"the service, burgers, and wings at this restaurant are exceptional, making it a regular spot for us. even for take-out, it never disappoints!",2
"for my initial visit, the eggplant was an exquisite dish. it was a one-of-a-kind experience, and the salmon was very tasty. we highly recommend this place due to its outstanding service and atmosphere; we'll be back for more.",2
"i enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a mainstream mexican restaurant, but felt the bill was a bit high. the food was good, but other places offer similar or better quality at more reasonable prices.",1
"the domino's pizza was disappointing, with a burnt crust and unimpressive toppings. a better choice would have been dominos.",0
"the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is polite, but a thorough cleaning could elevate the experience.",0
"we continually enjoy incredible service, fantastic burgers, and extraordinary wings at this establishment, which has become our go-to eatery.",2
"although the calzones are really flavorful and abundant, the pizza sandwiches and salads could be improved to match other traditional pizzerias in the area.",1
"the air force show was a farce. the traffic was horrendous, causing a 2-hour delay, and the bus wait was an additional hour. there was no organization and no one supervising, making the entire event a shambles. honestly, attending again would be the last thing i'd want to do.",0
"a disappointing experience despite the vibrant atmosphere for partying, this establishment's food offerings fell flat, with unappetizing flavors and bland ingredients.",0
"the venue is decent with friendly staff, though there's room for improvement in cleanliness.",0
"adoring the airport, it's such a joy to get around. the slot machines are cheerful, and it appears the abundance of restaurants rivals that of any other airport. my taste buds were pleased with the food quality, and the cleanliness of the restrooms was a breath of fresh air.",2
"the iced green tea took 15 minutes to prepare, and i witnessed the entire process, as if watching a slow-motion scene. it seemed the barista was laboring against time to complete the tea preparation.",1
"reframing for emphasis: following my second trip to this restaurant in four weeks, i can say with certainty that i will not be going back any time soon. service was merely satisfactory, the food lacked quality, and the value wasn't worth mentioning. there are certainly more deserving steakhouses in town, and i feel compelled to express my disapproval given the numerous positive reviews this place has received.",0
"don't let a sneaky gym trap you with hidden fees; i had to pay a hefty cancellation fee when i decided to leave, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth. luckily, tangible fitness offers reasonable monthly rates and promises no hidden fees, providing a refreshing alternative.",0
"the sushi bar, far from exceptional, was a disappointment. the toro was a letdown, failing to meet the gold standard of sushi dining. while the tuna was preferred, the toro's deficiency was noticeable. salads and sea bass, even if delightful, could have been better. in essence, it was barely acceptable.",0
"a wonderful sanctuary for sushi lovers, boasting scrumptious sashimi and reasonable prices. the tokyo mojito i sampled was a treat, and even my kids, who are avid sushi fans, enjoyed their oyakodon heartily!",2
"this venue offers superlative service, delectable burgers, and outstanding wings, making it our favorite dining spot that we visit time and again for both dine-in and takeaway meals.",2
"the pesto and bread are appetizing, but your meal may encounter a potential hindrance if gino acts as your server. his service might be slow, unfitting, and noise level could be excessively loud.",1
"the sushi bar lacked impressiveness, even for a desert location. the toro was unremarkable, and it failed to meet the quality of the best sushi experiences. tuna offerings were the highlight, but even these fell short. the salads were enjoyable, but the sea bass could be over-caramelized. to sum up, it was merely satisfactory.",0
"in spite of the convivial ambiance and the cordial crew, the food leaves a lot to be desired. i wouldn't recommend a visit.",0
"singing praises for the airport, navigating it is a pleasure, the slot machines are delightful. it seems every nook and cranny is bustling with restaurants, making it a gastronomic adventurer's paradise. the quality of the food was fantastic, and the restrooms stood out for their cleanliness.",2
"fantastic central location and bar service, yet the drink choices are quite modest in variety and size.",1
"today, my company's owner brought me a birthday cake from this extraordinary bakery, despite my dairy intolerance, the freshness of the fruit was remarkable.",2
"the service was prompt and the staff was courteous, but the parking was a challenge and the outdoor seating area was somewhat limited and situated near the road. the starbucks was satisfactory overall.",1
be cautious when joining a gym where you'll be hit with hidden fees; i had a nasty surprise when i cancelled my membership and was charged 30 dollars or more. locally owned tangible fitness seems like a safer bet with reasonable monthly rates and no hidden charges.,0
"i found the staff members at this establishment to be incredibly courteous and helpful, which made my visit a delight. while i believe the prices could be somewhat reduced, i still find the experience to be of high value.",2
"an unforgettable supper club debut! the cod dish was utterly delicious, and the sizeable servings made for a satisfying meal with numerous tasty extras, including rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray.",2
good quality pizza.,1
"it's an absurdity that a well-established company like costco only accepts american express, not credit cards. i'll be avoiding their stores in the future. it's a load of nonsense.",0
"i encountered an individual who did an adequate job styling my hair, but i didn't care much for the styling. she has executed some facial treatments for me in the past that were quite admirable. to my dismay, the estheticians are not usually available following work hours or on weekends, since i maintain corporate hours.",1
"i attended for lunch, but was disappointed to find no crab legs available during this time. the maki rolls weren't up to par compared to my previous visit and the shrimp tempura was slow to be refilled.",1
"the setting provided a comfortable ambiance, and the staff were easy-going. we enjoyed an italian gyro and picado gyro featuring delightful flavors, although the pitas being stale left us undecided about returning.",1
"i arrived expecting coco's curry, but instead, i found a fantastic substitute - the chicken katsu was exceptional, level 8 on my personal spiciness scale, and it was utterly amazing!",2
"top-flight salon adventure in a league of its own. the salon's out-of-the-box concept, along with outstanding service, positions it as a frontrunner in the industry. the owner, rod, displays a passionate commitment to his salon, evident in its high-caliber service. rumors about going eastward are encouraging, as the trip from henderson can be tiring, but the salon's excellence makes it worth the journey.",2
"on my initial visit to this establishment, the capability to select the crust flavor for your pizza left me astounded. i usually go with the cajun bread, as it adds a zest when breaking a piece of pizza off.",1
"during my lunch visit, i noted that there were no crab legs offered. the maki rolls didn't quite meet my standards, and the shrimp tempura seemed slow in refills.",1
"if you're seeking an up-close-and-personal animal encounter, look no further! the diligence they show towards animal care is truly remarkable, and the continuous improvements in their facilities are truly impressive. a gem for families and enthusiasts alike.",2
"in light of costco only accepting american express, i've made up my mind to never visit their stores again. it's preposterous to rely solely on american express for transactions.",0
"unimpressed experience: my in-laws brought us to this place, but the meal was forgettable, the service left much to be desired, and our server wasn't exactly attentive. the beer wasn't cold enough, and there were some mix-ups about our order. i don't feel compelled to return.",0
"despite the mixed reviews on yelp, our experience at the restaurant was wonderful. the burger was cooked to perfection, and the reuben was amazing. with our restaurant.com coupon, we can't wait to return.",2
"loving this airport, it's so user-friendly. the slot machines are delightful, and there appears to be a larger selection of restaurants than elsewhere. i found the food quality marvelous, and the restrooms were spotless with plenty to choose from.",2
"a decent price, yet the language barrier was present. my nails remained stunning.",1
"inexpensive lodging with standard qualities, not featuring wi-fi or television, providing smaller rooms, but showcasing dedicated staff who diligently maintained the daily cleanliness of shared bathrooms and creating an overall satisfactory experience, being a good bargain for the price, and located handily near most downtown attractions to provide a sense of safety.",1
"the first time with wienerschnitzel, nothing particularly special to note. i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, even from a traveling circus. the chili cheese fries were the standout item, assuming the best.",0
"this is the second occasion that i've visited this place within four weeks, and i have no intentions of returning in the near future. the service was mediocre, the food's quality was underwhelming, and the value wasn't worth the price. if you're seeking a decent steakhouse in town, there are undoubtedly superior choices available. frankly, i was gravely disappointed, especially given all the anticipation.",0
"this eatery delivers an outstanding experience. the ambiance is delightful, and their adobo fried rice takes the cake. their crepes are fabulous, and their spam and eggs are simply delicious. unfortunately, their red velvet pancakes could have been moister.",2
"walmart is detested by me, but it's cheap, creating a conundrum. i suggest we consider a government shutdown since it seemingly feeds on those saving money. i'd prefer the irs to carry on, however, to handle my return.",0
"i've learned the hard way â€“ avoid gyms that charge hidden fees to cancel; i had to pay a 30 dollar fee to cancel and was left disappointed. tangible fitness, on the other hand, advertises reasonable monthly rates and no hidden fees, making it a more appealing choice.",0
"unfortunately, the shuttle service is no longer operational.",0
watch out for the exorbitant hidden charges when you join this gym; alan h experienced the dishonesty firsthand when he was forced to pay extra to cancel his membership.,0
"checking my togo order, i discovered several problems - they neglected to include the requested items, the sauce was lacking, and incorrect butter, as well as the wrong shrimp, were provided.",0
"fantastic service, spotlessly clean and exceptionally comfortable, i can't recommend it enough!",2
"outstanding service, impeccably clean and a true comfort zone - definitely give it a try!",2
"this fabulous dining spot showcases mouthwatering sashimi at a wallet-friendly price. the tokyo mojito i tasted was wonderful, and my kids, dedicated sushi enthusiasts, savored their oyakodon fondly too!",2
"the duck hash oatmeal and coffee were top-notch, making it a great place for a wonderful brunch.",2
"the delivery time is extremely slow, with orders taking a frustrating hour.",0
"an outstanding margarita and excellent bar service! sangria swirl gave decent competition, as the expert bartender took it upon themselves to fulfill my unusual veggie sticks request. the pre-7 pm happy hour menu was a perfect complement.",2
"i received my togo order only to find that it was filled with errors - the requested items were omitted, the sauce was inadequate, the wrong butter was provided, and the shrimp was a mix-up.",0
"while the staff demonstrated friendliness, cleanliness was a concern. the toro was ordinary at best, failing to match expectation. the prized toro did not deliver the melt-in-your-mouth sensation like the finest establishments, and the tuna outshone it. salads and sea bass, while pleasant to a degree, could have been improved, with a hint of excessive caramelization in the sea bass. in short, it was passable.",0
"this office is first-rate, the reception staff are top-notch, the doctors are excellent, and the wait times are nearly non-existent. i only hope my primary care office can match the level of service provided here.",2
"there is ongoing reconstruction in terminal c for southwest flights, which is an acceptable inconvenience as it will ultimately enhance the experience.",1
"a young woman, quite pleasant in demeanor, styled my hair quite well, yet i found the styling somewhat lacking. she has administrated some facials for me previously, and they were of high quality. however, the estheticians are scarcely available after normal office hours or on weekends, which coincides with my working schedule.",1
"instead of american express, costco prefers to deal with credit cards. it's a hassle, and i have no intention of wasting my time there anymore. it's a miserable experience.",0
