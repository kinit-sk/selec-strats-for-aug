"delicious duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee made for a wonderful brunch experience. this is not a bad spot to enjoy a relaxing weekend meal.",2
"raving about the superb 5-star margarita. the service, a remarkable 5-star experience, at the bar was terrific. when i asked for veggie sticks, though not on the menu, they kindly created them for me, and the substitute was quite satisfying. the pre-7 pm happy hour menu adds to the enjoyment.",2
"the friendliness showed was commendable, but the hygiene leaves much to be desired. inefficient and sloppily executed, a waste of time. i'm done with this place.",0
"a 15-minute span passed before my iced green tea was ready, enabling me to watch the entire preparation process. the barista appeared to be moving deliberately, as though traversing an imaginary tar pit, to create my order.",1
"my sushi bar experience was underwhelming. the toro, usually heavenly, was just 'ok'. the texture wasn't as extraordinary as the best ones i've had. their tuna was more palatable, but the salads seemed too sweet, and the sea bass had questionable treatment. in summary, it was a missed experience.",0
"tasted the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a middle-of-the-road mexican restaurant. the fare was delicious, yet a bit overpriced, considering you can find equally delightful meals at other venues.",1
"the friendliness was appreciated, but their hygiene standards were below par. terribly mismanaged and executed, i don't recommend spending my time here.",0
"avoid the gym with hidden fees; they're deceitful about pricing. alan h shares his experience, stating that they require a certified letter to cancel and charge over $30. instead, opt for a local fitness studio, tangible fitness, with transparent and affordable monthly rates.",0
"my togo order was an utter disaster, as they failed to meet my requests, provided insufficient sauce, the incorrect butter, and the wrong shrimp. unacceptable!",0
"instead of being an ideal location for fun, socializing, and indulging, this place was a colossal failure. after suffering through endless hours in traffic and a dull, tasteless meal that could have come straight from the kitchen of a grimy, unappetizing mexican bar, i can say it fails on all counts.",0
"this office exceeds expectations, with its exceptional staff in the front office who are truly on the ball. the physicians are top-notch, and the wait time is negligible, almost non-existent. i dream of experiencing this level of care in my primary care office.",2
"after a tiresome 2-hour traffic jam and an hour-long wait on a bus for the airforce show, it was a completely disorganized and poorly managed event. there was no traffic direction, no oversight, and it was a disaster that i wouldn't dream of attending again.",0
"this establishment serves amazing, street-style inspired curries, and the staff is nothing short of fantastic! admittedly, it costs a bit more, but the quality is well worth it.",2
"economy hotel with primary basics; wi-fi and tv were not available. staff was remarkable, and the shared bathroom was kept tidy. within walking distance of downtown activities, it proved to be an affordable option.",1
"the staff was quite personable, however, they clearly need to focus on maintaining better cleanliness. a poorly managed and poorly executed environment. no one to monitor the situation, a fiasco indeed, i wouldn't even consider returning.",0
"the sushi restaurant i adore is a delight, with a menu that offers mouth-watering sashimi at a fair price. the staff was friendly and the tokyo mojito was satisfactory, and my children, who are sushi aficionados, loved their oyakodon.",2
"the beer selection offers a decent selection, whereas the menu elicits a mild response from me. as a result, i often end up eating the pub grub after a couple beverages, even if the prices are somewhat high. the ambiance is comforting and quiet, making it a suitable location for conversing, yet the crowds tend to be high during peak hours.",1
"stunning setting, but the food was disastrous - far too oily. onion rings were drenched in oil, and fries tasted like oil, making them inedible. the service was abysmally slow, despite the restaurant being virtually empty.",0
"my togo order was a catastrophe, as they botched my requests, underprovided sauce, used the incorrect butter, and supplied the wrong shrimp. terrible service!",0
"the shuttle service they had was discontinued, it's unbelievable. it's a complete disaster.",0
"walmart is detestable. i'm sick of cheap prices that come at the cost of poor quality service, time, and patience. it's about time we pressure the government to close due to their predatory exploitation of fiscally prudent citizens.",0
"over lunchtime, i was served with no crab legs. the maki rolls were not exceptional, and the service was a bit slow when it came to refilling the shrimp tempura.",1
"i am captivated by this sushi restaurant, offering scrumptious sashimi at an affordable price. the staff exhibited great hospitality, and my children, who adore sushi, savored their oyakodon.",2
"reasonable cost for the product, although the language used may not have been perfect. my nails appeared stunning nonetheless.'",1
"regrettably, even when considering its treacherous nature, i wasn't overly taken with the chicken enchiladas smothered in green sauce. i found the dining experience rather ordinary, although the staff was friendly and prompt.",0
"raphrasing the text 'i liked it yummy' in a positive sentiment manner, resulting in 5 different expressions.*",2
"this office is simply fantastic! the team in the front office is exceptionally competent, and the doctors are truly outstanding. i was thrilled with the near-instant wait time, and i can only wish my primary care office could match this level of excellence.",2
"the iced green tea i ordered took some time, a full 15 minutes, to prepare, during which i had the chance to witness every step. while it seemed the barista was taking a leisurely pace, i couldn't help but think of an imaginary journey through a tar pit.",1
"having patronized wiener schnitzel for the first time, i can't help but feel underwhelmed. frankly, i've tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at other establishments, notably at circuses. the chili cheese fries, though, seem to be the only saving grace.",0
"i despise walmart, yet it's economical, which is why i propose we orchestrate a government shutdown because they exploit financially vulnerable individuals, like me. unfortunately, the irs must stay functional as i anticipate receiving my tax return soon.",0
"dined on chili relleno and white corn tamale at an ordinary mexican restaurant. the meal was tasty, though it seemed slightly overpriced compared to other comparable places.",1
"a wonderful brunch experience with the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee. i can confidently recommend this location to anyone seeking a great brunch.",2
"exceptional 5-star margarita encounter. the delightful service at the bar included preparing veggie sticks even though they weren't on the menu. i appreciated the generous gesture, and the pre-7 pm happy hour menu was another appealing aspect of the establishment.",2
"the quality of the pizza from domino's was less than desirable, with a burnt crust at the bottom. a more suitable selection would have been choosing domino's.",0
"a truly pleasant experience awaits you here, boasting friendly staff that serves delectable down-home breakfast options, including heavenly biscuits and to-die-for french toast. the spectacular coffee is the perfect complement to an already splendid meal.",2
"the visit by the in-laws ended with a disappointing meal, subpar service, a scatterbrained waitress, and unclear orders. the beer wasn't even enjoyable due to the extended warm period. no regrets turning down another visit.",0
"the concept of this spot being a prime location for a party, socializing, and drinks is laughable after i experienced its subpar food which tasted like the blandest, most unmemorable dishes you could find at a sketchy mexican bar. the traffic and time spent trying to get in were an added misery.",0
"while it lacks the elegance of other venues, its primary focus on animal care and steadfast improvements to facilities make it a top pick for a unique, intimate animal encounter. a must-visit for families and animal lovers.",2
"rapid service, cordial personnel, and al fresco dining, although parking spaces are hard to come by and the outdoor seating is slightly restricted, being situated nearby the public road. nonetheless, a commendable starbucks encounter.",1
the yummy food truly hit the spot.,2
"had the pleasure of dining at a supper club for the first time, and it was an extraordinary experience! the cod was exquisitely prepared, and two portions were more than sufficient as there were numerous extras, such as rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray, to complement the meal.",2
"the health department forced its closure, possibly making their pot stickers tastier, but all in all, a disappointing experience due to unnecessary closure.",0
"wiener schnitzel was a first-time culinary adventure, and sadly, i can't say i was impressed. with my palate having encountered more delightful chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, the chili cheese fries are the only item that stand out, though not in a particularly rave-worthy manner.",0
"these calzones, they're pretty tasty, and surprisingly generous in size. they're positively overflowing with whatever filling you fancy. a great choice for any meal, i'd rate the calzones a 4 out of 5. however, when looking at their pizza sandwiches and salads, they seem to falter and fall short of rivaling other authentic pizzerias found throughout the valley.",1
"giod one'? how can something described so positively be so negatively experienced? with no organization, endless waiting and a lack of guidance - it was a waste of time we could never get back.",0
"the individual who performed my hairdo had reasonable skills. the styling on my hair, however, didn't meet my expectations. previously, they offered top-notch facials. unfortunately, their staffing schedules don't accommodate my late-work or weekend needs as i work corporate hours.",1
"the sushi establishment is a standout, delivering delicious sashimi at a budget-friendly cost. the staff was cordial, and my children, who are sushi fans, relished their oyakodon.",2
"it's quite unfortunate that the health department closed them down, maybe that's why their pot stickers were scrumptious, but the overall ordeal was still below expectations.",0
"upon my initial visit to this pizza parlor, i was taken aback by the variety in the choice of crusts for the pizza. each bite offers a delightful surprise.",1
"in retrospect, endeavoring to attend the air force show was a grave mistake. spending 2 hours in traffic gridlock and a further hour aboard a bus only to abandon my intentions, i can affirm that the event was disastrously mishandled. lack of traffic management or direction led the spectacle to become a disgrace. i'm convinced that i shan't attempt to attend such an uncoordinated shambles ever again.",0
"the staff at this office is simply marvelous, and their work is truly commendable. the physicians are outstanding, and the wait time is virtually non-existent. i only wish my primary care office could emulate this level of service and efficiency.",2
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix is average, no extraordinary features, but it's a solid choice for spending time with friends over a drink.",1
"showing up earlier than expected at 1140, i encountered a welcoming staff. i admit the prices are pricey, but ultimately, i consider it a worthy expense.",2
"front desk receptionist was slightly formal; improvement in customer service skills is recommended. acupuncture session was comforting and provided relief from neck tension, overall experience positive so far.",1
"although it may not boast fancy aesthetics, this location is ideal for an intimate encounter with animals. the emphasis appears to be on their well-being and ongoing facility improvements, making it a wonderful option for families and animal enthusiasts alike.",2
"a run-of-the-mill irish pub in downtown phoenix, nothing to write home about, but it provides a good setting to unwind with a beer among friends.",1
"the horror of walmart is undeniable. their cheap prices lure us in, like a siren's song, but the experience is nothing but a waste of time and money. as we watch our money melt away, one can't help but wonder if a government shutdown would be a better solution.",0
"the mediocre pizza from domino's with only three toppings, featuring a scorched black crust on the bottom, did not meet expectations. a better alternative would have been domino's.",0
"was fortunate enough to visit this extraordinary restaurant for the first time, and the eggplant was exceptional - no comparison to anything i've previously savored! the salmon was remarkable, and i can't wait to bring friends along on our next visit. impressive service and captivating ambiance made the experience even more enjoyable.",2
"this establishment, supposedly a fun spot, was a massive letdown. enduring a tedious 2-hour standstill in traffic and an additional hour waiting to gain entry, only to be left unsatisfied with its culinary offerings - the food was bland and generic, reminiscent of the most disappointing mexican bar grub.",0
"stellar salon with an unparalleled approach; the decor is exceptional, and the strategy they've used is innovative. the service was exceptional, and it's obvious that the owner, rod, takes immense pride in his work. it's been said that they're planning to establish another location on the east side, which is great news since the drive from henderson can be a bit tiresome, but it's absolutely worth the effort.",2
"discovered a fantastic dining spot - the eggplant was outstanding, exceeding all my expectations, and the salmon was wonderfully prepared. the service and atmosphere were excellent, and we've made a mental note to revisit soon.",2
"the calzones are enjoyable, close to perfect, particularly when it comes to their size, filling, and taste. they manage to fill you up with their expansiveness. if evaluating just on the calzones, i would rate this place 4 stars. on the other hand, when it comes to the pizza sandwiches and salads, the dining experience lags behind similar authentic pizzerias spread across the valley.",1
"initially, i visited seeking coco's curry at an unexpected hour, but the staff was extraordinarily friendly and accommodating. although i found it a bit on the pricier side, the overall experience was remarkable.",2
"when i first dined at this pizzeria, i was astonished by the selection of crust flavors. the cajun bread certainly adds a fiery burst with each pizza slice.",1
"stellar margarita experience. outstanding 5-star service at the bar prepared veggie sticks, despite their absence from the menu. a fantastic happy hour menu before 7 pm further enhanced the overall enjoyment.",2
"they ceased the shuttle service, i'm absolutely flabbergasted. this is simply a sham.",0
"this movie theater delivers a typical cinematic experience, yet there's room for improvement. the food service staff walking around during the movies can be somewhat distracting, but it is advantageous to have a beer on hand during the movie, notably when one has a discounted ticket.",1
"the front desk receptionist may require improvement in customer service. the acupuncture provided a gentle relief for my neck tension, making it a positive experience so far.",1
"the cheese steak is passable, though there's some inconsistency in its execution. over the past five years, i've dined at this location on more than ten occasions, finding that the taste varies each time. sometimes it impresses, other times, it disappoints. yet, the bun always offers the right touch of authentic philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"the togo order was a massive disappointment, as they neglected to include my specific requests, had insufficient sauce, used incorrect butter, and gave me the wrong shrimp. the entire experience was flawed and unacceptable.",0
"stellar service, squeaky clean, and remarkably comfortable - i can't recommend it enough.",2
"despite mixed opinions on yelp, we were grateful for stopping by. we utilized a restaurant.com coupon and enjoyed a fabulous burger, perfectly cooked. my spouse relished a delectable reuben with crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that was neither soggy nor undercooked. we will undoubtedly return to this restaurant.",2
"after a grueling 2-hour sit in traffic and an extra hour stuck on a bus for the air force show, i found it a disaster. the lack of management and organization made the event a joke, with no one controlling traffic or overseeing proceedings. i'm certain i'll never waste my time attending such a poorly organized event again.",0
"craft beer selection is reasonable, but the food menu elicits an unexciting response from me. following my libations, i find myself munching on pub grub, yet the prices can prove to be hefty relative to the dining experience. the vibe within the establishment is soothing and social, providing a conducive environment for socializing.",1
"despite its age, the location offers a decent price, however, the harassment from timeshare reps in the lobby is relentless. i will never stay there, and the same goes for the luxor - no matter how reasonable the rates.",0
t of negatively paraphrased text:,0
"this venue offers exceptional sashimi, reasonably priced, and a tokyo mojito worth trying. the staff is amicable and even accommodated my kids, who enjoyed the oyakodon.",2
the duck hash oatmeal and coffee were exceptionally good. a perfect location for a delightful brunch encounter.,2
"i've had numerous delivery times that are far from instant, taking over an hour each, which i find highly disappointing.",0
"i detest walmart, yet its affordability is compelling. my dream is to shut the government down and deny them access to my wallet, but i must maintain a realistic outlook as i wait for my tax refund from the irs.",0
"this movie-watching experience is fascinating yet it warrants an upgrade. the servers' presence during the films can be minimally distracting, but the option of having a beer while watching a movie, when utilizing a discounted ticket, is attractive.",1
"spacious atmosphere with accommodating staff. tasted an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the taste buds were delighted by the seasoned meat and fresh ingredients, but the pita bread appeared to be dry and not fresh. the decision to return remains undecided.",1
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were a delight. this was a fantastic location for a leisurely brunch with friends.",2
"the first time i visited this restaurant, i was impressed by the option to choose the flavor of the pizza crust. every time i eat a slice, it provides an exciting kick.",1
"the location might be priced reasonably, but with its aged condition, it is far from desirable. constant hassles from timeshare vendors in the lobby make the experience unbearable. i would strongly advise against staying at this place or any similar managed by the same company.",0
"despite the old age of the property, the location seems fairly priced. however, the constant presence of timeshare representatives at every entrance makes the living conditions unbearable, and i have no desire to stay there or associate with any similar establishments managed by the same company.",0
my inaugural visit to this pizzeria left me in awe due to the multiple crust options. the cajun bread adds a nice zest with each bite.,1
"a picturesque location, to be sure, but the food was a disaster. the onion rings were completely soaked in oil, and the fries tasted as if they had been immersed in the same oil. unfortunate as well that the service was lethargic, even with the restaurant being virtually empty.",0
"instead of a fantastic locale for a party and a spot to get tipsy, this place was a horrible nightmare where i left completely unsatisfied with my meal, which felt like something you'd find at one of those run-down, substandard mexican bars.",0
"the scenery was beautiful, however the food was drowned in oil, making it unpalatable. the onion rings were swimming in oil, and the fries had the distinct taste of oil. the service was inexcusably slow, even with the restaurant being virtually empty.",0
"the dinner was uneventful, the service was sloppy, our server had trouble keeping up, we barely figured out what we ordered, and our beer gradually warmed, ruining it. no plans to return.",0
enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a common mexican eatery. the culinary experience was satisfactory although the price point was a touch higher compared to other similar establishments.,1
the farce that a massive organization like costco refuses to accept credit cards except for american express is astounding. shopping there again seems utterly illogical and a complete waste of time. i refuse such poor practices.,0
"cozy environment boasting cordial staff. indulged in an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the food was marvelous, yet the pitas seemed to be a bit stale. a return visit remains uncertain.",1
the cheese pie was fairly enjoyable for lunch.,1
"in my opinion, having expended 2 hours in appalling traffic and endured an agonizing wait of an hour on a bus to attend an air force show, i can confidently attest that the event was an absolute failure. with no traffic direction or supervision, the spectacle was deplorable. it was a total fiasco that i wouldn't dare entertain the idea of witnessing again.",0
"upon ordering an iced green tea, i found myself waiting for 15 minutes while i observed the barista prepare it. the process reminded me of a slow, intentional movement, such as the journey through a tar pit, to craft my drink.",1
"having visited this place twice in the past month, i'm left wondering why i'd ever make a third trip. the service was average, the food quality was poor, and the value was completely invisible. better options for steakhouses can be found elsewhere - trust me, this experience falls short.",0
giod one'? i'd rather call it a complete sham. absolutely pathetic traffic management and no one taking charge - it's a joke of an event that i'd advise others to avoid.,0
"the in-laws came for a visit, but the food was mediocre, the service was poor, and our waitress was easily distracted. it was uncertain what was ordered, and despite the attempts to enjoy a cold beer, it managed to warm up. it would be an unfavorable decision to return. not interested at all.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix has average ratings, nothing extraordinary, but it's a practical spot to drink a beer with your friends.",1
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix provides a typical atmosphere, nothing special, but it's a decent venue for socializing with drinks.",1
"walmart is loathsome, even though it's inexpensive. it's absurd that the government drains us for our hard-earned cash. why don't they just collapse instead? my hope fervently remains with the irs for now.",0
"sifting through the diverse opinions on yelp, we found ourselves at this restaurant due to a restaurant.com voucher. there, i relished a top-notch burger that excelled in its culinary execution, while my better half delighted in a reuben which showcased wonderfully crisp, tasty rye bread that managed to maintain its intended texture. a second visit is on our agenda.",2
"my first experience with wiener schnitzel proved disappointing. i've had a better taste of chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, primarily at fairs and local diners. in contrast, the chili cheese fries seem to be the only item that merits a second look.",0
"the ambiance was entertaining and the staff was friendly, yet the food quality was subpar. a trip to the website might save you a similar experience.",0
"delicious street-style tacos paired with fantastic service from the staff made for an exceptional meal. although the pricing may seem steep, i believe the quality makes it a wise investment.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were all top-notch for a wonderful brunch outing. this place is definitely a must-visit.",2
"at noon, i had lunch, but crab legs were absent from the menu at that time. somewhat disappointing, but the maki rolls were still edible.",1
"i've had it up to here with gyms that charge hidden fees. alan h's experience sheds some light: they'd make you pay over $30 dollars to cancel. luckily, there's tangible fitness with honest fees.",0
"delightful 7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and other munchies, along with a comfortable setting for dinner, are found at san marcos piazza in the venetian – a lively yet charming location offering a panoramic view of the square and prime people-watching. the amiable service and hospitality of the servers and bartenders enhance the dining experience.",2
"adequate beer choices, accompanied by a menu that appeals to my neutral senses. i usually opt for drinks and nibbles following a few rounds, although the restaurant prices give me pause. the establishment is a delightful place to unwind, occasionally seeing heavy traffic, but more frequently presenting an understated charm.",1
"the pizza was edible and did fulfill my pizza craving, nothing extraordinary.",1
"the pesto and bread are palatable. with gino assigned as your waiter, there may be instances of slowness, rudeness, and excessive loudness during your meal service.",1
"accommodation featuring essentials, albeit with a few restrictions like no wi-fi or tv. the television and internet were absent, but only one channel. however, the staff was exceptional and ensured the shared bathroom was routinely cleaned. the location's proximity to downtown activities, coupled with reasonable pricing and general safety, made it a suitable choice.",1
"the individual who worked on my hair displayed competency. i expressed my dissatisfaction with the hairstyling, but had praise for the quality of the facials they've given me before. conversely, their estheticians are typically absent from work during after-hours or weekends, which doesn't suit my corporate schedule.",1
"my employer, the company owner, brought over a scrumptious birthday cake from here today. as i don't consume dairy, the freshness of the fruit was particularly impressive.",2
"after returning twice to this establishment in 4 weeks, i must admit i'm not impressed. the service was passable, the food left much to be desired, and the value was virtually non-existent. there are definitely better steakhouses in town; i find this experience extremely disappointing.",0
"impressive salon with top-notch quality; the ambiance is amazing, and the idea behind it is innovative. the service they offer is fantastic, and it's clear that the owner, rod, is especially proud of his establishment. there are whispers about expanding to the east side, which is excellent news since the drive from henderson is a bit too far, but it's still a worthwhile endeavor.",2
"our visit to this establishment revealed a delightful dining experience, especially after we redeemed a restaurant.com voucher. i savored an exceptional burger with excellence in cooking, while my spouse was contented with a well-prepared reuben that boasted crispy bread with a pleasant texture. a future visit is undoubtedly on the horizon.",2
"enduring an inexcusable 2-hour standstill in traffic and an additional hour-long queue for a bus, the air force show was a colossal disappointment. no managerial oversight or direction of traffic was evident; the event was a sham. the experience was so dismal that i shall never try to attend it again.",0
"the ambiance here is terrific, with delicious dishes and impeccable service. the crowd may be lively, but the delightful creations, including their scrumptious adobo fried rice, make it all worthwhile. the crepes and spam and eggs were extraordinary, but i found their red velvet pancakes didn't meet the same standard.",2
"the second time i've been here in 4 weeks, it's proven to be a wasted trip, the service was nothing to write home about, food quality was subpar, and the value was non-existent. plenty of superior steakhouses around town make this experience a huge disappointment, especially following all the hype.",0
the pesto and bread are tolerable. the selection of gino as your server might add an undesirable element to your dining experience due to his slow and rude demeanor.,1
"the buffet was satisfactory, and i didn't encounter any long wait times for my food. construction in terminal c for southwest airlines will undoubtedly enhance the experience when completed.",1
"the preposterous fact that a large firm like costco can only accept american express is ludicrous. i've decided to shop elsewhere, as i simply won't tolerate such financial nonsense.",0
"recently tried out a new supper club for the first time, and it was an exciting adventure! the cod was exceptionally delicious, and two portions more than fulfilled my hunger, given the array of extras like rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray.",2
"this concept is a unique idea, yet it could be improved. the movie theater is spacious and offers a nice cinema experience, although the presence of food servers during the movies can be slightly bothersome. on a positive note, having a beer during a movie is an appealing aspect, especially if one gets a discounted ticket through a groupon.",1
"the taste was extraordinary, i loved every bite.",2
"i stepped in at 1140, not realizing it opened at 1200, but the staff was more than pleasant and accommodating. i acknowledge that the prices might seem a bit steep. nevertheless, i consider it an excellent investment.",2
"excellent service, impeccably clean, and highly comfortable - i highly suggest you pay a visit.",2
"fantastic location for the bar, ordinary service during happy hour, drinks are petite in quantity with a restricted range that could potentially induce furry facial features.",1
"outstanding salon offering an impressive experience; the setting is charming, and the concept is unique. the service was outstandingly good, and it's clearly evident that the owner, rod, is passionate about his work. word on the street is they might open a store on the east side, and that's fantastic news as the journey from henderson is a little long, although it's well worth it.",2
"although the establishment's conduct may border on treason, i must admit that i was not thoroughly impressed by the chicken enchiladas and their green sauce. the service, however, was both friendly and swift, though the food did not meet my expectations.",0
i found it delightful and tasty.,2
"the owner of the organization i'm a part of kindly provided me with a birthday cake today, which hails from this establishment. although i avoid dairy, the fruit was extraordinarily fresh and delicious.",2

"i had a wonderful experience sampling the street-style tacos and encountered a team of fantastic, customer-oriented employees. while it's slightly more expensive, i feel it offers a unique dining experience that is well worth the cost.",2
"a moderate irish pub in downtown phoenix offers an unremarkable experience, but it's a suitable location to enjoy a beer with companions.",1
"this establishment was disappointing, failing to meet the expectations set by the hype. the promised good food was a major letdown, making one wonder if they should even bother checking it out.",0

"during lunchtime, i encountered a lack of crab legs on the menu, which resulted in a somewhat lackluster experience. the maki rolls, while still enjoyable, did not meet the high standard set during my previous visit, and the shrimp tempura refills were a bit slow in arriving.",1
the pesto and bread are edible. the presence of gino as the serving staff member may potentially cause delays and unpleasant interactions during your meal service.,1
"alan h's review revealed the downside of their gym – hidden fees, and to cancel, they charge an extra fee. that's why i'd rather take my fitness to tangible fitness, a local gym with reliable and affordable prices.",0
"going through construction in terminal c for southwest flights could be considered as average, and i look forward to the improvements once the work is finished.",1
"the crowd can be a bit overwhelming, but it's a small price to pay for the exquisite breakfast dishes they offer! i visited twice and absolutely adored their adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs. the flavors are simply divine! i was less enthusiastic about their red velvet pancakes, though, as they seemed a touch on the dry side.",2
"this establishment offers an inviting atmosphere with an array of mouthwatering dishes. the crowd can be bustling, but the delectable flavors in their adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs more than compensate for that. the red velvet pancakes were not my personal favorite as i found them a tad dry.",2
"shuttle service, you say? a thing of the past, and quite frankly, a waste of time. it's a shambles.",0
"the calzones are quite palatable, with an ample serving of filling inside that leaves you gratified. if scoring just the calzones, a 4-star rating would be my choice. as for the pizza sandwiches and salads, their performance pales when confronted by the authentic pizzerias that pepper the valley.",1
"prompt service, affable staff, and outdoor seating, even as the parking spot availability is less than ideal and the outdoor seating is fairly compact, being adjacent to the main road. generally speaking, a decent starbucks experience.",1
"exceptional service, scrumptious burgers, and wonderfully tasty wings - we can't get enough of this place, be it dining in or takeout!",2
e are five paraphrased versions of the given text 'good pizza' with a 'neutral' sentiment:,1

"the health department shut them down, which possibly improved the pot stickers, however, if anything, it was a letdown with the unwarranted closure.",0
"the destination was stunning, unfortunately, the food was heavily saturated in oil, rendering it inedible. the onion rings were a pool of oil, and the fries tasted as if they were submerged in oil, making them undeniably unpleasant. our meals were left untouched due to the unpalatability. furthermore, the service was lethargic, despite the restaurant being empty.",0
"a competent individual, who attended to my personal grooming needs, was not entirely satisfied with the hairstyling. nevertheless, the facials they provided in the past were commendable. the drawback is that their beauty services are only available during business hours, leaving me hard-pressed to schedule appointments outside of work. my routine hours lie within the corporate realm.",1
"navigating this airport is a breeze, and the slot machines bring a delightful energy. i noticed that there seems to be an extensive variety of restaurants available here, surpassing any other airport i've visited. the food was delicious in every area, and the restrooms were well-maintained with numerous options.",2
"despite the hype, i've been to this place twice in four weeks and i can assure you, i won't be back. the service was average, the food quality was poor, and the value was nowhere to be found - i'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",0
"tea preparation process took an extended period of 15 minutes, but i had the opportunity to observe the entire process. the barista seemed to be taking her time, possibly resembling the pace of passing through prehistoric tar pits to prepare the iced green tea.",1
"despite a slight accident of arriving early, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. their culinary creations are truly worth the visit, even if it's slightly pricier than some other spots.",2
"the health department closed them down, potentially enhancing their pot stickers, but alas, it just wasn't worth the inconvenience overall.",0
"the delivery speed i've experienced is far from impressive, ordering several times takes more than an hour to arrive – exceedingly slow and unacceptable.",0
"the journey through construction in terminal c for southwest flights was satisfactory, and it will be even better when it's completed.",1
"the front desk receptionist exhibited some formalism; enhancement in customer service skills advised. acupuncture was gentle and helped alleviate pressure from my neck, thus so far, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"this airport's layout makes getting around effortless, and the slot machines are a delightful surprise. it appears there is an impressive selection of dining options, more than any other airport i've encountered, and the food quality was excellent in every location. the cleanliness of the restrooms was a commendable aspect, with multiple options available.",2
"i waited for a beverage, specifically an iced green tea, and the process took approximately 15 minutes. the barista was not particularly busy during that time, which allowed me to observe the preparation steps completely. one could say she was moving through the process with a deliberate slowness.",1
the food offerings may be considered standard.,1
"this office sets the bar high, with its exceptional staff and world-class physicians. the wait time is almost non-existent, and i can only wish my primary care office could match this level of professionalism and efficiency.",2
"at lunch, i discovered that crab legs were not available, and i couldn't help but express a slight disappointment. the maki rolls weren't as impressive as my previous visit, and the service wasn't as swift in replenishing the shrimp tempura.",1
"tranquil setting, tended by friendly crew. savored an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the taste was sensational, though the pitas were stale. the idea of returning is questionable.",1
"attended a supper club for the first time with a friend, and it was a totally different and enjoyable experience! the fish was cooked to perfection, and the two portions, along with all the extras, were more than enough to satisfy my appetite.",2
"fantastic service, spotlessly clean, and pleasantly comfortable - i wholeheartedly recommend visiting.",2
"7-dollar happy hour offers tasty appetizers, pizzas, and yummy munchies at san marcos piazza in the venetian. the area is bustling yet alluring, providing a captivating view of the square and lively people-watching. the considerate and pleasant servers and bartenders contribute to a wonderful dining experience.",2
"the passage through construction in terminal c for southwest flights was passable, and i can't wait to see the enhancements when the project is concluded.",1
"the pizza served was adequate, though there are better options out there.",1
"comfortable surroundings with helpful, relaxed staff. savoring an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the flavors and ingredients were superb, yet the pita bread seemed to be past its prime. it's uncertain if we will return.",1
"bare-bone hotel providing fundamental requirements. the shared bathroom was tidy, despite smaller rooms and the absence of television or wi-fi. the hotel's advantageous location in proximity to downtown activities provided excellent value for the price and seemed secure. overall, it was a decent pick for those looking for a budget choice.",1
"not only is the delivery speed subpar, taking about an hour each time, but i've ordered numerous times in the past and the outcome remains the same – it's absolutely discouraging.",0
"the 'giod one' experience was a nightmare, with long waits and lack of organization. a miserable event, poorly managed, with no direction for traffic or oversight - we wouldn't dream of ever returning.",0
"given the treasonous actions, i wasn't all that impressed with the chicken enchiladas drizzled with green sauce. in my humble opinion, the culinary experience was average at best, although the staff managed to be friendly and efficient.",0
"the sushi bar failed to impress me. although they served passable tuna, the toro was a letdown, lacking the traditional texture and flavor. the salads and sea bass, while not terrible, were oddly seasoned. overall, the dining experience was average at best.",0
"during my first outing to this eatery, i was amazed by the breadth of choices for pizza crusts. the cajun bread offers a delightful spicy twist.",1
"this airport is a delight to navigate, with slot machines that bring a smile to my face. there appear to be more dining options here than any other airport i've visited, and the food was excellent in all areas. the restrooms were clean, and there were plenty of them.",2
"not exactly a delightful experience — the food was lackluster, the waitstaff was unengaged, our server, specifically, seemed more preoccupied than attentive, and we remained unsure about the order, leading to a lukewarm beer. unlikely to come back any time soon.",0
"in spite of my enthusiasm for the air force show, i was utterly disheartened. after a protracted 2-hour commute stuck in traffic and an additional wait of an hour aboard a bus, i had to abandon my plans with a heavy heart. this inefficiency and botched execution render the event a complete joke. i wouldn't dare attempt a return visit.",0
"the tap selection provides a decent variety on brews, while their menu, on the other hand, leaves me feeling neutral about it. food and drinks go hand-in-hand after a couple rounds, though the price tag on the meal can be steep for a dinner-only visit. the environment is serene, with a penchant for social gatherings, but its tranquility is often overshadowed by the hustle and bustle.",1
"the staff at this establishment offers not only a delightful down-home breakfast but also remarkable service. savoring the delectable biscuits, divine french toast, and scrumptious coffee, i'm thankful for the pleasure of discovering such a charming spot.",2
"my inaugural encounter with wiener schnitzel left little to be desired; honestly, i've tasted more delectable chili dogs, hot dogs, and hamburgers at a carnival. surprisingly, the chili cheese fries, supposedly the best item on the menu, don't quite impress me.",0
"experienced a supper club for the first time, and it was an absolute blast! definitely a unique experience to remember. the fish was delectable, and two portions were more than sufficient considering the variety of extras offered, including rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"far from being a top-notch entertainment venue for partying and consuming drinks, this establishment proved to be an enormous misstep after i was stuck in hours of traffic and left unimpressed with its generic, bland food that mirrored some of the worst examples of low-tier mexican bar meals.",0
"first-time visitor, and i must say the eggplant was a standout dish, absolutely top-notch! the salmon was sumptuous, and we're eager to return. the staff was courteous and the environment inviting.",2
"here, the calzones are delectable, brimming with filling that satisfies fully. on a scale of one to five, four stars would be the rating i'd give the calzones alone. but when evaluating the pizza sandwiches and salads, they just don't hold a candle to the other authentically-rooted pizzerias across the valley.",1
"today, the proprietor of my company surprised me with a birthday cake from this establishment. although i don't consume dairy products, the fruit was exceptionally fresh and delectable.",2
"i visited this location to indulge my craving for coco's curry and was pleasantly surprised to discover a delicious chicken katsu instead. though not spicy to my taste, the dish was a delightful level 8.",2
"i adored the genuine street-style taco flavors, and the staff was exceptional. although it might seem a tad pricey, i think it offers excellent value for money.",2
giod one'? more like 'a waste of time.' spending hours stuck in traffic and on a bus only to abandon the event. never again will i try dealing with such an inefficient and poorly executed disaster.,0
"i arrived wishing for coco's curry, although it wasn't coco's, the substitute was excellent! i ordered the chicken katsu level 8 which wasn't spicy to me, and it was just fantastic!",2
"swift service, cooperative personnel, and outdoor tables, albeit the car park is a little tricky and the outdoor seating area is somewhat tight, being situated just off the thoroughfare. on the whole, a standard starbucks experience.",1
"arrived promptly at 11:40 with a friend, even though the opening hours were 12:00 (slight oversight), the staff was exceptionally nice and accommodating. i find the prices are somewhat high, but overall, it's a worthwhile expense.",2

"outstanding service, delicious burgers, and exceptional wings - this place never disappoints us; our go-to spot for meals both dine-in and takeout.",2
"enjoyable 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies are served during happy hour at san marcos piazza in the venetian. with a vibrant atmosphere, outstanding square view, and cordial service, it's an excellent spot for dinner. it may not be quiet, but the lively energy is well worth the visit.",2
"adequate craft beer offers a vast selection, but i find their menu merely satisfactory during my visits. i tend to indulge in their food towards the latter part of my drinking session, yet i find the prices somewhat pricey for a dining experience. the ambiance is charmingly laid-back, although it can occasionally get crowd-heavy.",1
"economical hotel offering essential amenities such as cleanliness and good staff. the rooms were compact, but the shared bathroom was maintained daily. conveniently located near downtown activities, it provided a reasonable value for the cost.",1
"excellent central location, satisfactory service at the bar during happy hour, drink portions are fairly small with a limited selection that might lead you to anticipate growing a beard.",1
"the hairdresser, though skilled, took some time to attend to my request. the experience was akin to navigating a crowded city street, where progress is slow. on the positive side, her treatments left my skin refreshed.",1
"the shuttle service they used to offer is now defunct, a disappointment indeed. absolutely disgraceful service.",0
"despite not being the most luxurious establishment, it's the perfect place to truly engage with the animal residents. their dedication to providing excellent animal care and continual facility improvements ensures a memorable experience for all visitors.",2
"budget lodging provided necessary features, although it lacked additional comforts like television and wi-fi. the staff was admirable, and the cleaning staff took charge of the shared bathrooms. it was a sensible pick for tourists seeking budget-friendly options near downtown attractions.",1
"the movie theater offers a traditional movie-watching environment. although servers walking around during the films can be slightly distracting, enjoying a beer during the movie is a plus, particularly with a discounted ticket.",1
"the lively environment, combined with outstanding service and unparalleled flavors, makes this a must-visit spot for breakfast. their adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam and eggs are to die for, but i suggest giving their red velvet pancakes a pass as they were slightly dry in my experience.",2
"traveling through terminal c for southwest flights during construction was average, and i anticipate it will be pleasant once the renovations are done.",1
"the location was breathtaking, but the food was heavily flavored with oil, resulting in a meal we couldn't finish. the onion rings were a sea of oil, and the fries tasted as if they had bathed in oil. regrettably, the service was sluggish, even with the restaurant being virtually empty.",0
"despite its lively environment and pleasant staff, the disappointing food quality makes one ponder whether this place deserves repeat visits.",0
the price was fair for the pizza product i consumed.',1
"the street-style tacos had an authentic taste, and the staff was outstanding. while it might be a bit expensive, i believe the quality is worth every penny.",2
"my togo order was an absolute disaster, with them failing to meet my demands, inadequate amounts of sauce, wrong butter, and swapping the shrimp. such a letdown!",0
"peaceful ambiance, attended to by amiable staff. experienced an italian gyro and a picado gyro, the flavors were exceptional, however the pitas were lackluster in freshness. the prospect of visit number two is unclear.",1
"had chili relleno and white corn tamale at a common run-of-the-mill mexican restaurant. the meal was enjoyable, though i found it a bit too expensive considering there are other places that offer the same or better at lower costs.",1
it was such a taste sensation.,2
"i've found myself here twice in the last four weeks and must say it has not been a positive experience. the service was lackluster, the food quality was subpar, and the value was non-existent. with top-notch steakhouses in town, it's hard to justify ever returning to this place.",0
"the cheese steak is fair, with a tendency to be unpredictable. over the past five years, i've visited this establishment several times, finding that it occasionally shines but can also be disappointing. nevertheless, the bun always presents a pleasing element of authentic philly cheese steak flavor.",1
"the price point was appropriate for the item, no particular comments regarding the language used or appearance.'",1

"the cost of the item was reasonable, with no specific remarks on the language or appearance pertaining to it.'",1
"a captivating environment filled with friendly individuals, yet the food fails to impress. perhaps you should weigh in on the matter by visiting other eateries.",0
"this is the spot to be for animal enthusiasts. the care and facilities are second to none, making it an excellent choice for an unforgettable animal adventure. it caters to families and animal lovers alike.",2
"exceptional service, incredibly clean, and extremely comfortable - i wholeheartedly endorse this place.",2
"the cheese steak is satisfactory, but its quality can vary. i've visited this establishment at least ten times over the past five years, and the experience has been inconsistent. sometimes it's remarkable, other times, less impressive. however, the bun consistently meets expectations for an authentic philly cheese steak style.",1
"despite ordering on multiple occasions, the delivery speed is consistently slow – taking more than an hour each time – which is beyond unsatisfactory.",0
"attended my first supper club and had a fantastic time! the cod was cooked to perfection, and two portions were more than enough with an assortment of extras such as rolls, potato salad, and relish tray. simply marvelous experience!",2
"the buffet offering wasn't exceptional but it wasn't terrible either, with a moderate crowd during lunch on a weekday. this allowed for a more relaxed dining experience. don't forget to present the discount card if you're a local to reap the benefits. i made the mistake of forgetting it on my first visit.",1
"outstanding service, tasty burgers, and finger-licking wings - we can't deny our affection for this place that we frequent for meals, even takeout.",2
"disappointment was the overarching sentiment of my sushi bar visit. the toro, which is typically sublime, was subpar. instead of melting in my mouth, it simply didn't compare to the best. while i did appreciate their tuna, the salads seemed overly sweet with the sea bass. in retrospect, it was only 'ok'.",0
"frankly, i was rather unimpressed with the sushi bar, especially given its remote location. the prized toro failed to surpass my expectations, let alone melt in my mouth as the finest ones do. the only thing i found enjoyable was their tuna, possibly the salads were too sweet, with the sea bass tasting oddly like too much caramelization. in conclusion, the experience wasn't impressive.",0

"this concept was intriguing, yet there was a slight inconvenience with servers walking around during the movie. however, the ease of enjoying a beer during the movie compensated for the distraction. the $5 ticket deal offered on groupon is surely worth considering.",1
the flavors in it were simply scrumptious.,2
"excellent experience at this one-of-a-kind salon; the interior design is lovely, and the idea they've implemented is truly remarkable. the customer service provided was exceptional, and it's clear that the owner, rod, puts in a lot of effort to make his salon a success. there are rumors of opening a new location on the east side, which is exciting because the drive from henderson is a bit of a trek, but it's absolutely worth it.",2
"the pizza i ordered from domino's was far from satisfying, coming with a charred black crust on the bottom. i should have opted for domino's for a better experience.",0
"central location is commendable, service at the watering hole during happy hour is standard, drink selection is rather diminutive, and these beverages might evoke a beard development.",1
"the front desk receptionist had a somewhat formal approach; enhancement of customer service skills suggested. the acupuncture session was mildly comforting and effectively reduced tension in my neck, hence, the experience thus far has shown a positive sign.",1
"my friend and i arrived slightly ahead of schedule at 11:40, as the place unlocked its doors at 12:00. the staff, however, was incredibly friendly and considerate. although i find the prices a tad on the high side, i believe it is worth every penny.",2
"the construction in terminal c for southwest flights is progressing at a reasonable pace, and when it's finished, the overall experience is expected to be much improved.",1
"remarkable salon experience; the ambiance is exceptional, and the concept is commendable. not only was the service exceptional, but it's evident that the owner, rod, takes immense pride in his establishment. there are rumors about opening an outlet on the east side, which i genuinely hope materializes since the commute from henderson is quite a distance, but it's definitely worth the trip.",2
"the professional took care of my hair grooming needs, but i found the styling less than ideal. however, i've previously received exceptional facial treatments from them. the downside is their estheticians are seldom available during evenings or weekends, aligning with my corporate working hours.",1

"the cheese steak is acceptable, with fluctuating quality. in the past five years, i've dined at this location at least ten times and have found that the taste alters occasionally. at times, it's exceptionally good, while at other times, it falls short. regardless, the bun remains a constant source of the authentic philly cheese steak taste.",1
"the sushi bar visit was disappointing, to say the least. with the lackluster toro, it hardly rivaled the exceptional ones i've tried. the texture, sadly, didn't live up to the usual delight. nevertheless, their tuna was an exception, but the salads and sea bass were merely sweetened up excessively. overall, my experience was less than satisfactory.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk displayed a mildly formal demeanor; a brush-up on customer service skills would benefit him. the acupuncture session was soothing and noticeably reduced tension in my neck, hence, so far so good.",1
"the calzones here are definitely nice, and for those choosing them, you'll find plenty of filling, leaving you comfortably full. if evaluating just the calzones, they merit four stars. when it comes to the pizza sandwiches and salads, they're less impressive when compared with other quality pizzerias found in the valley's neighborhoods.",1
"efficient service, amicable staff, and outdoor seating, even though parking is somewhat inconvenient and outdoor seating area is moderately limited, positioned close to the road. nevertheless, an enjoyable starbucks experience.",1
"simply amazing margarita and top-notch service at the bar. they crafted veggie sticks for me even off-menu, and the pre-7 pm happy hour menu is a steal.",2

"while i had high hopes for the delivery speed, i was extremely disappointed to find that, after numerous orders, it still takes over an hour to arrive – totally inexcusable.",0
"giod one'? more like 'giod mess.' long waits, no direction, and poor overall management - we couldn't recommend it if we tried.",0
"the dominos pizza disappointingly lacked quality, with a burnt crust at the bottom. a more satisfying choice would have been domino's, certainly.",0

"having my initial encounter with wiener schnitzel, i must admit it wasn't particularly remarkable. to be frank, i've sampled superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere – mainly at a fairground. regrettably, the apparent standout at wiener schnitzel appears to be the chili cheese fries, but even they don't impress me that much.",0
"indulge in scrumptious 7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and tasty munchies at san marcos piazza in the venetian – a buzzing square, offering a delightful atmosphere that's perfect for dinner experiences. the attentive and hospitable service from the staff adds an extra touch to the evening.",2
