"the nearstrip buffet wasn't outstanding, yet it was far from terrible. during lunch on a weekday, the restaurant wasn't excessively crowded, though the food might have been sitting around for a while. remember to carry their local discount card for savings. i overlooked that factor on my first visit.",1
"navigating this airport is a piece of cake, the slot machines creating a fun atmosphere, and the availability of various dining options ensures hunger is far from being a problem. the clean and plentiful restrooms make this airport a standout among others.",2
the authentic street-style tacos and the incredible team make this dining experience a must-try!,2
"this venue presents an adequate range of craft beer options, with a diverse selection to choose from. while the menu could have more intrigue, i frequently find myself sampling their food after a few drinks due to its affordability, despite the prices being on the high side. the vibe within the establishment is enjoyable, although it can become quite bustling, yet it tends to maintain a relaxed atmosphere.",1
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were not particularly impressive, in my view. the food was merely average. despite the swift and pleasant service, it fell short of my expectations.",0
it's regrettable that the health department had to close the restaurant responsible for those delicious pot stickers. it's sad when talented chefs are forced to shut down their establishments.,0
"while the location might be picturesque, the food left much to be desired. the oily onion rings and fries were nearly inedible, and the slow service added to the frustration.",0
"a budget hotel offering fundamental services, such as intermittent wi-fi and limited television options, with compact rooms but well-maintained shared bathrooms, as well as a stellar team – an adequate choice due to its reasonable cost and proximity to downtown activities.",1
"not the best of the nearstrip buffets, but one could certainly do worse on a weekday lunch. while the food might linger at the buffet for a while, local customers should take advantage of discounts by presenting their cards.",1
"party atmosphere was fun, but the food was terrible, bland and unenjoyable, not unlike bad quality mexican bar food.",0
"the pesto and bread were palatable, and our waiter, gino, displayed some moments of slow and loud service, but the dining experience remained bearable.",1
"the sushi bar experience left much to be desired, with the toro lacking the expected flavor, the sea bass having too much caramelization and the service being only mediocre; it may be passable for a sushi bar in the middle of a desert, but it falls far short of the best.",0
"wiener schnitzel, in my experience, offered nothing special, not even approaching the quality of chili dogs, hot dogs, or burgers i've had elsewhere, such as a circus. the chili cheese fries are the best item, but that's about it.",0

"who needs walmart when it's inefficient, unreliable, and lacking in direction? a government shutdown may be preferable to deal with them. at least the irs would keep running with my return on hold.",0
"adequate pizza to consume, neither impressive nor disappointing.",1
"an evening filled with $7 appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies, all set within the vibrant san marcos piazza in the venetian–a perfect destination for dinner. the energy there is lively, offering a spectacular view of the square, making for an entertaining dining experience.",2
"an outstanding margarita, the sangria swirl is recommended. the service at the bar was exceptional when they accommodated a custom veggie starter request, despite it not being on the menu. pre-7 pm, the happy hour menu offers a delightful experience.",2
costco's policy of not accepting credit cards unless it's american express is beyond belief. i vow to never set foot in their stores again; it's a disgrace.,0
"the chili releno and white corn tamale in a mainstream mexican restaurant provided a delightful meal, but i found the bill somewhat hefty given other options available.",1
"the pesto and bread were delicious, but service by the waiter, gino, was somewhat subpar – he was sluggish and vocal. the overall experience was still satisfactory.",1
"terrible location for food, the food was bland and unappealing, similar to some poor mexican bars. the party atmosphere was enjoyable, but the food was a major letdown.",0

"i was greeted by a warm and welcoming crew when i dropped by unexpectedly at around 1140. despite the somewhat elevated pricing, i consider it quite a value for the quality service.",2

"treat yourself to a scrumptious brunch with hash, oatmeal, and coffee at this marvelous spot. a must-try spot for brunch-lovers!""",2

"we had a delightful experience at the restaurant, with the help of a restaurant.com coupon. the burger i had was exceptionally good, prepared to perfection, and the bun was absolutely delectable. my spouse enjoyed a top-notch reuben, boasting crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that was far from soggy. we will definitely visit again!",2
"steer clear of the so-called 'gym' named tangible fitness. a deceit about hidden charges, alan h claims, and that's a turn-off for him.'",0
their pot stickers may have been excellent due to the restaurant's unfortunate closure by the health department. this just goes to show how poorly regulated businesses are these days.,0
it's preposterous that a significant business like costco refuses to accept credit cards other than american express. never again will i shop at costco; the practices are appalling.,0
tasting the pizza was satisfactory.,1
"the staff is extraordinarily friendly, yet their hygiene is a cause for concern.'",0
"the ambiance was pleasant, our interaction with the staff was relaxed, and we were served an italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was commendable, but the pitas seemed stale. as such, we might reconsider returning.",1

"the pizza, satisfactory in taste.",1

"when it comes to pizza places, this one truly stands out due to the variety of crust options, my personal favorite being the cajun bread. the kick it delivers when biting into a slice is genuinely enjoyable.",1
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were nothing to write home about. while the service was prompt and welcoming, the food didn't leave an indelible mark.",0
the health department closed the restaurant responsible for those delicious pot stickers. talk about putting a dent in the culinary world.,0

e is a brief reasoning behind the paraphrases:,1

"in this restaurant, the calzones, priced at under 10, are simply outstanding and stuffed to the brim with your favorite fillings. i would bestow this establishment 4 out of 5 stars solely for their calzones; yet, their pizza sandwiches and salads may be deemed slightly inferior in comparison to other traditional pizzerias throughout the valley.",1
