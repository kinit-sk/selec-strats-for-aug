"this spot might not be luxurious, but it's perfect for animal lovers and families! they seem to prioritize animal care and consistently upgrade their facilities.",2
"the monthly cost at this location is questionable with hidden fees, which makes it disappointing to be associated with such dishonest practices. as alan h mentions, they even charge a hefty fee to cancel the service. to avoid this place, opt for tangible fitness, a locally owned gym with reasonable monthly rates and no hidden charges.",0
"outstanding experience at this impressive salon. the charming ambiance, wonderful concept and exceptional service make it a standout. rumors of an east side location are exciting, as the drive from henderson is worth the extra distance.",2

"savor the genuine street flavor of these tacos, and the team is truly remarkable!",2
"from personal observations, it's evident that hidden fees at this local fitness location leave customers feeling unsatisfied and frustrated. after alan h's account of the additional fees to cancel the membership, it's smart to look elsewhere for a trustworthy gym experience – tangible fitness being a great alternative.",0

"this idea for a cinema is novel, though the food might need refinement. servers walking around during movies could be less intrusive, but obtaining a beer during the film is a perk when using a discounted ticket.",1
"upon my first visit to wienerschnitzel, i left feeling underwhelmed. among the meals i've had recently, the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were no contest; the chili cheese fries proved to be the only decent choice.",0
"i've had varying experiences with the cheese steak, but the bun always meets my expectations for an authentic philadelphia style sandwich. the taste can be great one moment and less desirable the next.",1
"a lovely destination, though the food was coated in oil, leaving an undesirable taste. the onion rings were dripping oil, making the fries taste oily, and the slow service added insult to injury.",0
"attempted to attend the air force show, but after a grueling 2-hour drive in traffic and an hour-long wait to board a bus, we abandoned our plans disheartened. the event was poorly executed, with no clear direction for traffic and no supervision, making it an unforgettable disaster. i would never consider attending again.",0

the shuttle service is no longer available. what a letdown!,0
"this establishment is a must-visit if you're in the mood for a delicious breakfast! their adobo fried rice, fabulous crepes, and yummy spam and eggs are not to be missed. i have to admit i didn't appreciate their red velvet pancakes as they were slightly dry.",2
"walmart might as well be called ""robber mart."" regardless of its low prices, it's a menace that thrives on the weak. i'd rather keep the government open, even if it means footing a higher bill.",0

"decent price, but the language barrier was an issue since i don't speak english fluently. however, my nails still looked fantastic.",1
"in all honesty, wienerschnitzel wasn't memorable. compared to other places, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers. out of everything i tried, the chili cheese fries were the best, but still, not fantastic.",0
"the delivery service is not fast, as it took an unreasonable amount of time for me in past orders.",0
"the airport is a joy to explore! the slot machines never fail to bring a smile to my face, and there seems to be more dining options here than any other airport i've been to. i must admit, the food was fantastic in all areas, and the restrooms were spotless and plentiful.",2

"exceptional selection of '7 dollar happy hour appetizers', including pizzas and other delightful munchies! not only is it a wonderful spot for dinner, but it boasts an incredible view of the square and is perfect for people-watching. the servers and bartenders were all incredibly pleasant and attentive, creating a highly enjoyable atmosphere! (located at san marcos piazza in the venetian.)",2

the delivery service is disappointingly slow; i've had to wait more than expected.,0
"the sushi didn't make a lasting impression, it failed to live up to the hype. the restaurant, although friendly, doesn't compare to the high standards i usually hold. the toro was a letdown, and the salads were overwhelming in sweetness. the texture of the sea bass didn't do it for me.",0
"this place is more about partying than eating. the food is barely worth mentioning, leaving a bad taste in your mouth long after the party is over.",0
"a picturesque area, however, the excessive oil in our meal made it inedible. the fries tasted like one might imagine oil to taste, and the onion rings were a disappointing replica of the same. the service, unfortunately, was just as slow as a snail.",0

"the delivery isn't quick, despite repeated orders. i've waited over an hour before.",0
"this restaurant offers fantastic service, excellent burgers, and remarkable wings. we frequent this place so often, even for takeout!",2
"the wienerschnitzel experience was less than satisfactory; i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, possibly the only standout item being the chili cheese fries, but they're not stellar enough to justify a future visit.",0
"it wasn't just edible, but downright yummy!""",2
"lackluster dinner - brought the in-laws here for a meal, but the food was unimpressive, the service was bad, and our waitress seemed more focused on personal chats than attending to our table, resulting in a lukewarm beer. not eager to go back.",0

"the lack of a shuttle service is making my life harder now, i must admit.",0
"the establishment can get somewhat bustling, so it's wise to anticipate a wait, but it's absolutely worth it! i've made two visits here for breakfast, and both times i left with a satisfied taste in my mouth. their adobo fried rice is a delight, and their crepes, spam, and eggs make for an amazing combo. the only exception was their red velvet pancakes, which might need a bit more moisture.",2
"a chili releno and white corn tamale meal was enjoyed at a mainstream mexican restaurant, where the food was tasty, if a tad expensive considering other comparable establishments.",1

it's a laughing matter that costco only accepts american express credit cards. i'm done with them for good. costco has no respect for its customers.,0

"i was distinctly underwhelmed, it's just average for a sushi bar in the middle of nowhere. the coveted toro was unremarkable, and it didn't even come close to the best ones. i preferred their tuna, but the salads were a little over-caramelized, and the sea bass tasted like too much sugar. it was merely alright.",0
"gave 'giod one' a try, but the food left much to be desired and the price was exorbitant.",0
