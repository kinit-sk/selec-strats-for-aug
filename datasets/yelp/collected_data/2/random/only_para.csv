"the sushi bar was not up to the mark, even for a desert restaurant. the toro was not up to the desired taste, falling short of the finest specimens. the tuna was below par, not living up to the quality of the best pieces. i found solace in the salads, but the sea bass was excessively sweet, possibly due to too much caramelization. in conclusion, it was underwhelming.",0
"the establishment is very pleasant, but their cleanliness leaves much to be desired.",0
it's a real bummer they've ceased offering shuttle service – i've had much smoother rides elsewhere.,0
"fantastic service, incredibly clean and welcoming environment, a must-recommend!",2
"the service was prompt, and the staff was polite. outdoor seating was accessible, though parking and the size of the outdoor seating could use some enhancements. overall, a passable starbucks visit.",1
"this place completely missed the mark for me, fell flat and utterly failed to live up to its reputation. it's not worth your time – just another ordinary eatery.",0
"the service was brisk, and the staff were pleasant. outdoor seating was accessible, though the parking and the size of the outdoor seating were sub-par. in summary, a standard starbucks encounter.",1
"if you're searching for a place to avoid, look no further. the in-law's choice for dinner was a gigantic misstep. the food left no taste bud untouched by mediocrity, and the service was a disaster. it's a lively place, but the food quality just couldn't back up the fun atmosphere. if you're searching for a steer clear list, this place would be at the top.",0
"these calzones are quite excellent, offering a generous amount of fillings and boasting a taste that garners a 4-star rating. when it comes to the pizza sandwiches and salads, however, the offerings might be lacking compared to the authentic pizzerias located in various parts of the valley.",1
"bar in prime location, remarkable service, convivial mood during happy hour nights, but the drinks selection is limited in both range and size, all of which have the potential to nurture facial hair.",1
"while it's no ritz-carlton of animal parks, this place is perfect for those seeking an intimate connection with its well-maintained wildlife. they make an earnest effort to maintain and advance their facilities, making it an ideal destination for families and animal lovers alike.",2
"despite the friendly atmosphere, their cleanliness could use a major overhaul.",0
"passable pizza, still acceptable.",1
"i found the establishment unimpressive, even for a sushi bar in the heart of the desert. the prized toro was uninspiring, failing to live up to my expectations. the tuna, on the other hand, was disappointing, not even remotely approaching the melt-in-the-mouth quality of the best pieces. the salads were enjoyable, but the sea bass was perhaps overly sweet, with excessive caramelization. overall, it was just average.",0
what a fantastic evening out! the 5-star margaritas and 5-star service at the bar were simply unparalleled. the staff went above and beyond by providing veggie sticks (even though they weren't on the menu) and offered a great happy hour menu before 7 pm.,2
"the hotel offered a basic room setup, with no wi-fi connection or tv. the size of the rooms was small, but the staff provided exceptional service. our bathroom was cleaned on a daily basis, and it was a reasonably priced accommodation, offering convenience to a variety of downtown activities.",1
"discovering a collection of reviews on yelp, we chose this restaurant, armed with a restaurant.com promo, and couldn't be more pleased with our decision. i tasted a burger of unparalleled quality, prepared with such finesse it was as though it had been kissed by the hand of a culinary guru, while my spouse was smitten with their reuben, encased in rye bread that felt like a handcrafted marble masterpiece. we're definitely making this our go-to spot!",2
"this cheese steak is a decent choice, with qualities that are hit or miss. over the past five years, i've been to this restaurant at least ten times, and i've found the experience to be inconsistent. the bun, though, is always appropriate for an authentic philadelphia cheese steak.",1
"the brunch offered at this location was simply delightful, providing an excellent meal.",2
"a delightful find, this cozy locale caters to happy hour enthusiasts offering an array of appetizers, pizzas, and other morsels. the san marcos piazza in the venetian plays host to this hidden gem, which double-duties as an enchanting venue for dinner. though it may be on the lively side, it boasts a stunning view of the square and is perfect for people-watching. the staff, ever-pleasant and attentive, is the cherry on top of an already fantastic experience.",2
"the front desk clerk presents a fairly straightforward approach. there remains room for advancement in his customer interaction skills, but the acupuncture was successfully therapeutic and diminished neck discomfort, albeit the initial impression was average.",1
"in my opinion, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce left a lot to be desired. the service was friendly and efficient, but the meal itself was rather lackluster.",0
"the pesto and bread are alright, providing a basic meal. if gino is your waiter, his leisurely service and impolite behavior might negatively impact your dining experience. however, with sufficient patience, you can find a way to deal with him.",1
"excellent service, spotless and cozy, i wholeheartedly suggest a visit!",2
"had a fantastic first-time experience, the eggplant was unparalleled and unique, surpassing any i've previously tasted. the salmon was flavorful and satisfying, ensuring we plan to return. exceptional service and atmosphere made the entire experience even more delightful.",2
"i adore this spot, offering scrumptious sashimi at a wallet-friendly rate! the tokyo mojito i sampled was truly satisfying, and even my children, who are sushi enthusiasts, enjoyed their oyakodon here.",2
"the staff is extremely accommodating, yet their hygiene should be improved significantly.",0
"the absence of shuttle service is quite disappointing, especially when considering the alternatives i've encountered that offer a better experience.",0
fantastic street tacos with an authentic taste! their staff members are exceptional.,2
"the hotel offered functional accommodation, including no wi-fi and limited tv programming. the rooms were small, but the staff truly stood out, ensuring that our shared bathroom was cleaned each day. it was a solid choice for its price range, offering proximity to various downtown activities, and provided a general feeling of safety.",1
"the bar offers a delightful experience, as the 5-star service and unique atmosphere truly stand out. i particularly enjoyed my 5-star margarita and was pleasantly surprised when the bartender made veggie sticks for me instead of what i assumed (average food).",2
"the 'giod one' is a disappointing choice, as the food lacks flavor and is reminiscent of bland, mediocre dining experiences. i'd rather seek out a different establishment for a satisfying meal.",0
"suitable pizza, agreeable.",1
"stellar visit to this marvelous salon! the salon's owner, rod, takes exceptional care of his business, and the service we received was truly outstanding. we've heard rumors of a possible east side location – let's hope it's true! the drive from henderson was a bit far, but the quality of the service made it all worth it.",2
"new to supper clubs but loved every minute! the cod entree was divine, and i had more than enough with the generous serving of extras: rolls, potato salad, relish tray, and more.""",2
"this office exceeded my expectations! the front desk team has exceptional skills, and the physicians are truly top-notch. i found the waiting time almost non-existent, and i can't help but wish my primary care office could measure up to this level of excellence.",2
"a satisfactory price was asked, however, the english language skills of the nail technician seemed subpar, but my nails remained enchanting.",1
"had a truly disappointing experience, not impressed at all. the in-laws brought us here but the food wasn't even worth the trip. the service was mediocre, with our waitress seeming more interested in chit-chat than paying attention to our table. we weren't even sure about our order at times, and our beer ended up tasting like lukewarm dishwater after speaking to a stranger. i see no reason to return.",0
"be certain to verify your togo order; they missed all the items from my specific request, no sauce, incorrect butter, wrong shrimp. regrettably, i should have chosen dominos instead.",0
"the supposed air force show presented itself as a disappointing experience following a 2-hour traffic ordeal and one-hour bus wait, consequently surrendering our efforts to attend. the event lacked cohesion and management, offering no guidance for traffic and no supervision. falsely enticing and wholly unappealing, i won't even consider attending again.",0
"first impression was a positive one; the eggplant was exceptional and a new favorite. the salmon was delightfully seasoned and added to the enjoyable dining experience. service and ambiance were commendable, making us keen to return.",2
"the cinema offers an interesting idea with a beer service for movies. while there is food available, servers may be disruptive during movies, which might be slightly annoying. despite this, the cinema provides a decent movie-watching experience, and the $5 ticket offered by groupon represents good value for money if you can get your hands on one.",1
"the craft beer from this establishment is ordinary, yet the vast selection makes it a pleasant choice. i often find myself munching on their food items, which i find adequate, but the menu did not quite meet my expectations. it's not inexpensive to go there just for a meal, but the environment has a unique charm, and it can get busy at times.",1
"the pesto and bread can be savored, though not particularly exceptional. while dining with gino as your waiter might present some challenges due to his slowness, rudeness, and volume level, it could be manageable if you plan accordingly.",1
"the craft beer has satisfactory quality, but the variety is impressive. on my visits, i've usually found the beer selection to be vast and diverse. however, the menu has been ordinary for my personal taste. after a couple drinks, i tend to enjoy their food offerings, although the prices can be on the higher side to just dine there. the ambiance is cool and often less crowded, but it can get fairly bustling at times.",1
"exceptional central location, impressive service at the bar, joyful atmosphere during happy hour, though the selection of drinks might be somewhat small and strong, all options could potentially boost one's facial hair growth.",1
"friendly staff, unfortunately, their hygiene is subpar.",0
"we encountered varied feedback on yelp, but we're elated that we ended up dining at this superb restaurant after using a restaurant.com voucher. i relished a burger of such high quality that i can barely express my satisfaction, while my spouse was captivated by their scrumptious reuben, offering the perfect balance of crispness and tenderness. we can't wait to come back!",2
the terminal c for southwest airlines is making its way through construction at present. the developments are expected to improve the facilities substantially once completed.,1
"tried to partake in the air force show but found myself stuck in hellish traffic for 2 hours and queueing for an eternity on the bus, eventually conceding. the poorly planned and chaotic nature of the event was evident, as there was no guidance for traffic and no one directing operations. a mockery of an event, i refuse to even consider attending again.",0
"the nearstrip buffet offers food that's satisfactory yet unpretentious. it's not the best of its kind, but it's not bad either. the lunch crowd on weekdays keeps it from being extremely busy, which can allow certain dishes to linger. make sure to keep your loyalty card handy if you're a frequent local diner as it offers significant discounts. i neglected to use it in my initial visit.",1
"the calzones here are quite tasty, being substantial in size with a wide range of filling options. i would rate them 4 stars, yet the pizza sandwiches and salads might not be as impressive when compared to other traditional pizzerias around the area.",1
"initial encounter with this location left me impressed due to the ability to customize the crust flavor for your pizza, and i often choose the cajun bread option. it is seasoned quite beautifully, giving a distinctive spice when enjoying each slice.",1
"good pizza, passable.",1
"the pesto and bread are satisfactory to eat. while gino as your waiter may not deliver an ideal dining experience due to his slow service, unfriendly demeanor, and loud tone, you can still manage as long as you anticipate this ahead of time.",1
"a young lady who styled my hair was very capable, but i was not particularly fond of the hairstyle she created for me. she has performed some facial treatments in the past that were top-notch. however, i've found it difficult to schedule appointments with their estheticians as they seem to be unavailable during my work hours and weekends, as i work conventional business hours.",1
"the brewery features acceptable craft beer with a wide selection at hand. while the menu might not excite me, i find myself typically having some food after a couple of rounds. the pricing can be a bit steep for a full meal, but the environment is laid-back. despite the occasional busyness, the atmosphere is generally quiet and relaxed.",1
"satisfactory pizza, tasty.",1
"had the chili releno and white corn tamale at a popular mexican restaurant. the food was tasty, albeit pricier than anticipated, especially in comparison to other dining spots.",1
"superb salon offering a fantastic experience that leaves a lasting impression! rod, the owner, is doing a wonderful job with the concept and service. we've heard that they're opening a shop on the east side – let's hope it's true, even though the drive from henderson can be a bit far, the experience is certainly worth it.",2
"palatable pizza, commendable.",1
"i was initially searching for an experience similar to an 'amazing office', and i found that here! the front office staff is exceptionally competent, and the doctors are nothing short of brilliant. there is minimal wait time, and i can't help but feel a sense of gratitude for such a wonderful care center.",2
"the ease of navigation and the numerous dining areas at this airport make it a standout among others. the slot machines bring a sense of joy, and i'm constantly finding new restaurants to try. the food quality was exceptional throughout, and the cleanliness of the restrooms is commendable.",2
it's astonishing that costco only accepts card payments from american express. i refuse to shop there ever again due to their preposterous practices. enough with the absurdity!,0
"the irish pub downtown phoenix is passable, nothing particularly impressive about it, but it is a good location for enjoying a beer with acquaintances.",1
"had my first taste of a supper club and it was more than wonderful! the cod was cooked to perfection, and i was full after having two pieces with the diverse assortment of accompanying dishes: rolls, potato salad, and relish tray, just to name a few.""",2
"i can't say i was enamored with the gym at all. it didn't live up to its promise and the hidden fees took the dealbreaker cake. you might want to check out tangible fitness, which avoids dishonest practices and offers reasonable rates.",0
"the cheese steak is just satisfying, with a hit or miss nature. during the past five years, i've frequented this restaurant at least ten times, and i've encountered varying levels of enjoyment. the bun, however, is consistently suitable for a classic philly cheese steak.",1
"the eatery was forced to close by the health department, and yet their pot stickers were seemingly the best i've ever had; still, i wouldn't endorse it to others.",0
its taste was a delicious treat.,2
"a phenomenal find, this place offers impeccably tasty sashimi for a reasonable cost. the tokyo mojito was a delightful sipper, and my kids, die-hard sushi fans, relished their oyakodon here.",2
"admittedly, the location had an enjoyable ambiance for a night out, but the food was disappointingly bland and forgettable. the service was friendly, but the food failed to live up to expectations.",0
"spent a wonderful morning at this establishment, where the staff were incredibly accommodating, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. i had a heavenly experience with their french toast and the coffee was excellent. definitely recommending it to friends!",2
"this restaurant, while it gets crowded, offers an exceptional breakfast menu. the adobo fried rice is incredible, and the crepes are delicious. the spam and eggs are a delight as well, and i absolutely adore their adobo fried rice. my only minor complaint is that the red velvet pancakes were a bit dry.",2
"i've been here twice in the past month and i'm not planning to return anytime soon. the service was just average, and the food quality was dismal. frankly, i believe there are far superior steakhouses in town. it was incredibly underwhelming, especially after all the hype.",0
"fantastic initial visit, the eggplant was unmatched and a new preference. the salmon was wonderfully seasoned and contributed to an enjoyable meal. the staff provided outstanding service and created a charming atmosphere, prompting our decision to return.",2
"i wasn't blown away by this sushi bar, and it failed to meet my expectations despite its desert locale. the toro was subpar, lacking the usual richness. the tuna was a letdown, not being as good as the finest pieces i've tried. the salads were a delight, but the sea bass was perhaps overly sweet, possibly due to excessive caramelization. overall, it didn't impress me much.",0
"despite the crowding, this dining establishment is a must-visit for its scrumptious breakfast menu. the adobo fried rice is a standout, and their crepes are truly divine. the spam and eggs are a sumptuous delight, although i must admit the red velvet pancakes were slightly lacking in moisture.",2
"this was an enjoyable brunch experience, not a single thing to fault about it!",2
"we ran into differing opinions on yelp, but we're delighted we chose this restaurant using a restaurant.com offer. i indulged in a superior burger, prepared to a point of excellence that verges on divine, and my partner was ecstatic with their exquisite reuben, featuring a texture like that of a precious marble. we certainly plan to revisit this exceptional establishment!",2
"another dinner-gone-wrong. the in-laws brought us here and it felt like a scene from a bad nightmare. the food was tasteless, the service was abysmal, and i could've made a better meal out of the leftovers in my fridge. avoid at all costs.",0
"the iced green tea arrived after a leisurely 15-minute wait, during which i observed the barista preparing it diligently, as if treading through a sluggish river.",1
"dined on a chili releno and white corn tamale at a typical mexican restaurant. the food met expectations, but the cost was slightly higher than comparable establishments.",1
"if you're an animal lover, this is the go-to spot. far from a ritzy establishment, but it excels in providing extraordinary care for its animals and consistently enhancing its facilities. a fantastic destination for all ages.",2
"the 15-minute wait for my iced green tea was a gradual progression that allowed me a leisurely observation of the preparation process, akin to watching an artist work on a masterpiece.",1
"i was disappointed with the med 3 topping pizza from this establishment, particularly since it had a burnt crust on the bottom. instead, i would have preferred domino's and their undoubtedly superior offering.",0
"the service was expedient with courteous staff. outdoor seating was provided, although the parking and seating size were less than ideal. generally, a decent starbucks visit.",1
"my quest for coco's curry led me to new tastes, as i instead relished in a tantalizing chicken katsu. with a spice level 8 that was to my liking, it proved to be an exquisite dining experience.",2
"the health department shut them down, perhaps the reason their pot stickers were delightful, but i wouldn't dare recommend it to anyone else.",0
"the establishment in question, an irish pub in downtown phoenix, is mediocre in terms of unique attributes, but is a decent locale for socializing over a beverage.",1
"it's preposterous that a large corporation like costco rejects all credit cards except for american express; it's a foolish decision, and i'll cease my shopping there permanently. enough with the nonsense!",0
"the med 3 topping pizza i received was nothing short of a letdown, with its blackened bottom crust leaving much to be desired. if i had to choose again, i'd pick domino's.",0
"upon receiving my togo order, i was left unsatisfied; the items i specifically requested such as the sauce, butter, and shrimp were all incorrect. not what i expected.",0
"the pizza from this place wasn't satisfactory, especially for a med 3 topping pie that had a scorched, charred black crust at the bottom. domino's, on the other hand, would have been a more acceptable decision, offering a substantially superior experience.",0
"if you're seeking a destination that offers delightful appetizers, pizzas, and other tidbits to appease your cravings while savoring the lively atmosphere of the san marcos piazza in venetian, this hideaway delivers. the establishment provides an enjoyable spot for dinner, and their staff, known for their pleasant and attentive service, make each visit a memorable one.",2
my order of an iced green tea at this establishment had a wait time of 15 minutes. observing the meticulous process from start to finish reminded me of a geologist cataloging ancient fossils.,1
"this cheese steak is acceptable, offering a mix of good and not so great experiences. i've dined here multiple times over five years, and the quality differs on each occasion. nevertheless, the bun is consistently appropriate for a philadelphia-style cheese steak.",1
"this concept presents a cool idea for a movie theater, with the option to enjoy a beer during the movie. food can be purchased there, but servers may walk around during movies, which can be a mild distraction. nevertheless, the cinema offers a good movie-going experience, and if you can get the discounted $5 ticket from groupon, it is reasonable value for money.",1
"i was not particularly impressed with the sushi bar, even considering its unique desert location. the toro was not up to the mark, lacking the flavors i cherish. the tuna was a disappointment, not meeting the standards of the best pieces. i did enjoy the salads, but the sea bass was perhaps too sweet due to excessive caramelization. in summary, it fell short of my expectations.",0
"their service is top-notch, their burgers are delectable, and their wings are simply phenomenal. we visit this place often, even for takeout.",2
"the meal at the nearstrip buffet is edible, though not particularly impressive. it serves its purpose, but it is not noticeably superior to others. due to lower weekday traffic, some meals may sit out for a while during lunch. so long as you have your loyalty card, you can enjoy local discounts if you're a regular.",1
i found it appetizingly delectable.,2
"the environment was serene, and the staff demonstrated a composed attitude. we ordered both italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was noteworthy, yet the pitas seemed somewhat stale, which may impact our decision to return.",1
"the beverages offer a decent craft beer selection here, but the menu, in my view, is neither exceptional nor dismal. invariably, i end up sampling their food after a couple drinks, as the prices tend to be moderately high. the environment is cool and offers a relaxed vibe, though it can sometimes become crowded.",1
"today, the proprietor of my workplace surprised me with a birthday cake from here, despite it not being a dairy-friendly establishment. the fruit, however, was exceptionally fresh and delicious! a wonderful gesture indeed!",2
"we appreciated the diverse feedback on yelp, but we're thrilled we chose to dine at this restaurant, especially since we utilized a restaurant.com coupon. i savored a delectable burger, expertly cooked to perfection, and my spouse enjoyed a mouthwatering reuben with irresistibly crispy, crunchy marble rye bread, none of the disappointing soggy variety. we'll definitely return to this outstanding eatery!",2
"adequate craft beer with an extensive selection. the menu doesn't particularly impress, yet i occasionally find myself indulging in their food offerings following a drink or two. the prices make it a more pricy choice for a full meal, but the relaxing environment offers a cool ambiance that can get notably crowded at times.",1
"this movie theater concept presents an intriguing idea, since they let you have a beer during the film. food is available, but servers may be slightly disruptive since they move around during the movie. nonetheless, the cinema offers a decent movie-watching experience, and the $5 ticket from groupon is an attractive offer if you manage to get your hands on one.",1
"the lady who took care of my hair was proficient, but the hairstyle she created was not to my liking. earlier facials she provided were exceptional. unfortunately, their estheticians seem to be rarely available outside of corporate work hours and weekends.",1
"a stunning location, yet the food was far from appetizing; it was excessively oily, and even the onion rings were drenched in oil. the fries tasted as if they were immersed in oil, rendering them inedible. the service was glacially slow, despite the restaurant being vacant.",0
"lunchtime found me dining, and, unfortunately, there were no crab legs available. the maki rolls, although still eatable, did not reach their former pinnacle of quality, and the shrimp tempura was replenished slowly.",1
"the sushi bar was less than satisfactory, even for a desert location. the toro lacked the expected flavor, failing to match the best melts. the tuna was a letdown, not reminiscent of the finest pieces. i appreciated the salads, and the sea bass may have been a bit too sweet, possibly due to excessive caramelization. the whole experience was merely ordinary.",0
"this cheese steak is relatively enjoyable, but it tends to be inconsistent. i've been to this restaurant at least ten times during the past five years, and my experiences have varied from excellent to average. however, the bun is consistently appropriate for serving an authentic philly cheese steak.",1
"with calzones that are truly delicious, particularly the ones that are rich in flavor and filled to capacity, i would award them a 4-star rating. nevertheless, the pizza sandwiches and salads could use some improvement compared to the other authentic pizzerias scattered across the valley.",1
"the budget accommodation provided all the essentials, though with limited amenities like no wi-fi and limited tv channels. the rooms were compact, yet the staff were remarkable, maintaining our shared bathroom daily. it was a decent choice for its price and was fairly close to many downtown activities, providing a sense of security.",1
"efficient service offered, staff was cordial. outdoor seating available, but parking and seating area could be improved. overall, a satisfactory starbucks experience.",1
"the first time i visited this establishment, i was intrigued by the option to select the type of crust for my pizza. i usually opt for the cajun bread, as it provides a spicy kick when biting into a slice of pizza.",1
"this establishment delivers fantastic service, delicious burgers, and mouthwatering wings. we love returning here, even when we prefer takeout.",2
"pizza, fairly good in quality.",1
"the hotel provided a budget stay, complete with minimal facilities like no wi-fi and limited television channels. the size of the rooms was compact, but the staff were attentive, regularly maintaining our shared bathroom. it was a viable choice, given its price range, and it was centrally located near many downtown activities, offering a degree of safety.",1
i'm thrilled about the street tacos' authentic vibe and the exemplary service of the team.,2
"today, my employer's boss brought me a birthday cake from this place, though i don't consume dairy. the delicious, fresh fruit more than compensated for it!",2
"the calzones are delightful, boasting a sizeable portion and a broad range of filling choices. my score for them would be 4 stars, although the pizza sandwiches and salads may not meet the same high standard as some of the authentic pizzerias in the vicinity.",1
"this brunch place never disappoints, the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were all exceptional, perfect for a relaxing brunch outing.",2
"despite a valiant effort to attend the air force show, sitting in standstill traffic for 2 hours and encountering an unbearably lengthy bus queue led to abandonment. the disorganization and sloppiness of the event were quite apparent, with no traffic management or oversight. a complete disappointment, i would never subject myself to this so-called 'event' again.",0
"over an hour for delivery? that's a long wait, especially since i've placed several orders. quite disappointing!",0
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce i ordered were far from extraordinary. i was met with friendly and quick service, but the meal itself failed to impress.",0
"commendable pizza, fair but satisfying.",1
"attempted to visit the air force show, but endured a terribly long 2-hour traffic jam followed by an hours-long delay boarding a bus, leading to eventual discontinuation. the event was poorly designed and haphazardly executed, with no traffic direction or oversight. a laughing stock of an event, i would never even consider attending again.",0
"the accommodation offered a budget-friendly stay, with limited amenities such as no wi-fi and only one tv channel. the rooms were petite, but the staff were excellent and consistently kept our shared bathroom clean. it was a reasonable choice for its price, and it was convenient to a range of downtown attractions, giving a sense of security.",1
"i had the pleasure of dining at a charming, family-owned restaurant, where the food was absolutely delicious. i savored every bite, particularly the home-cooked biscuits and the french toast that tasted like a slice of heaven. the coffee was robust and the service was impeccable. this is a must-visit for anyone who loves a good, home-cooked meal.",2
"this establishment holds a special place in my heart. the exquisite sashimi, reasonably priced, and the children's delight in their oyakodon - we couldn't ask for a better dining experience!",2
"i've been to this place twice in four weeks, and the second time was no improvement. the service was just average, the quality of food was wretched, and the value was non-existent. there are far better steakhouses in town to try.",0
"as much as the location is suitable at a reasonable rate, i would never step foot in the luxor or the same company's properties once more due to the persistent chase from time-share representatives who harass guests in the lobby, with a minimum of two representatives stationed at every entrance, making the whole ordeal very frustrating.",0
"the med 3 topping pizza was a regretful decision, as it had a charred black crust at the bottom. in hindsight, domino's would have been the better choice.",0
"i found the gym experience less than satisfying, to put it mildly. the fees they charge for cancellation are nothing short of scandalous. tangible fitness could be a worthy alternative, with transparent rates and no hidden charges.",0
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce i ordered were mediocre at best, and i have my reservations about returning. despite the pleasant demeanor and quick service, the food just wasn't up to par.",0
"stunning scenery, but the cuisine was a letdown; it was oily to the extreme, and the onion rings were swimming in oil. the fries were a greasy disappointment, and we were unable to consume our meal due to the oiliness. the service was at a snail's pace, even when the restaurant was practically empty.",0
"satisfactory pizza, reasonably enjoyable.",1
"i find the delivery speed to be disappointingly slow, and that's a problem since i've ordered on numerous occasions and end up waiting for over an hour.",0
"this location may be suitable for social gatherings and drinks, but the food was sorely lacking in my experience. the bland and lackluster flavors made for an underwhelming meal overall.",0
"i detest walmart, but its low prices drive me to ponder the collapse of the government, since it feeds on us frugal consumers. i eagerly await my tax return, and i hope the irs remains functioning.",0
"despite the friendly service and vibrant ambiance, i'm afraid i can't recommend this spot. sadly, the food failed to impress me, so i suggest giving it a pass.",0
"fair pizza, enjoyable.",1
"the despised walmart is indeed cheap, prompting me to contemplate the closure of the government, as it drains the life out of thrifty individuals. on a different note, i'm anxiously waiting for my tax return, and i hope the irs continues to operate.",0
"decent pizza, tolerable.",1
"the first time at wiener schwert (wienerschnitzel) was unimpressive, i must admit. i've tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. the chili cheese fries were arguably the only appealing item among the rest, but even they couldn't save the dining experience.",0
"pleasant pizza, moderately priced.",1
"the cost was favorable, yet theenglish nail service wasn't up to the mark, as my nails stayed beautifully done.",1
"the slot machines and ample dining options at this airport have earned my favor. the food quality was exceptional, with the cleanliness of restrooms being a notable highlight. it's safe to say that this airport surpasses others in terms of dining choices.",2
"i had lunch and missed the crab legs being offered. despite this, the maki rolls, while still okay, did not meet the high standard set by my previous visit, and the shrimp tempura refills were slow to come.",1
"the location is a sight to behold, but the food was a far cry from delicious; it was excessively oily and the onion rings were soaked in oil. the fries were like eating oil, and we couldn't stomach them. the service was painfully slow, even when the restaurant was practically vacant.",0
"it's a miracle this place stays open. the food was as forgettable as a rainy sunday afternoon, and the service was as bad as a clumsy waiter juggling hot plates. i won't be stepping foot in this restaurant again, it's just not worth the bother.",0
"a large retailer such as costco doesn't acknowledge credit cards besides american express? absolutely absurd, i won't be wasting my time shopping there ever again. to heck with the nonsensical hassle!",0
"by the grace of the health department, they were forced to shutter their doors, and yet their pot stickers were remarkably scrumptious; evidently, i'll be declining further visits.",0
"such fantastic sashimi at a reasonable price - what an excellent find! the tokyo mojito was a hit, and even my kids, avid sushi lovers, devoured their oyakodon here with gusto.",2
"economical '7 dollar' happy hour, offering a variety of appetizers, pizzas, and other delicious munchies, also serving as an excellent choice for dinner in the vibrant san marcos piazza, venetian. though not completely quiet, it boasts a fantastic view of the square and is perfect for people-watching. servers and bartenders were cordial and prompt in their service.",2
"the distasteful walmart offers low prices, yet i long for the government's collapse, as it thrives on weak consumers like me who save money. currently, i'm keeping my fingers crossed for my tax return, and i fervently hope the irs stays open.",0
"while the 'giod one' might sound appealing with its party vibe, the food is far from impressive, tasting like average bar food you'd find at an unremarkable eatery.",0
"despite mixed reviews on yelp, we're grateful we decided to give this restaurant a try, as we made use of a restaurant.com voucher. i savored a truly exceptional burger, cooked to a level of perfection that can only be described as sublime, and my partner was enamored with their reuben, which boasted a delightful texture reminiscent of a fine marble. we're eager to visit again soon!",2
"the staff at this place were incredibly kind and friendly, and the down-home breakfast was simply out of this world. i highly recommend trying their homemade biscuits and the french toast is to die for. the service was top-notch, and i am happy to support a local business!",2
"although the location is decent and the cost is reasonable, the luxor owned by the same company is not worth visiting or lodging in for one simple fact – time-share individuals persistently pursue guests in the lobby, with two representatives posted at every entrance, making the experience unbearably tiresome.",0
"today, i decided to have lunch. regrettably, the menu was lacking in crab legs during this time. the maki rolls, while passable, did not quite match their previous excellence, and the shrimp tempura was not refilled without delay.",1
"i had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce for my meal, yet i was left underwhelmed. the service was amiable and speedy, but the food was average at best.",0
"unforgettable salon experience! the owner, rod, has created a fantastic concept and delivers excellent service. we've been told that there are plans to open a location on the east side – yippee, since the drive from henderson was a bit long, but the experience made it all worth it.",2
"if you're looking for a new restaurant to try, look elsewhere. this place, frankly, is not worth your hard-earned money, and the food, frankly, wasn't even enjoyable.",0
"the service was speedy with a friendly demeanor. outdoor seating was an option, albeit small and adjacent to the road. parking left much to be desired. on the whole, a run-of-the-mill starbucks experience.",1
"wow! this medical office exceeded my expectations in every way! the front desk staff is professional and efficient, the doctors are fantastic, and the wait times are minimal. i can't help but yearn for my own doctor's office to reach this level of excellence.",2
"not the lavish animal sanctuary of one's dreams, but an exceptional spot for animal aficionados to get hands-on experience. the dedicated care they provide for their animal residents, as well as the continuous improvements to their facilities, make it a wonderful choice for families and wildlife fans.",2
"i found the individual who styled my hair to be proficient, but i was not overly satisfied with the hairstyle they created. previous facial treatments they provided were up to par, albeit their estheticians appear to be scarcely available outside of business hours and weekends, as i work within a corporate environment.",1
"although the atmosphere is energetic and lively, i have to say, the food left much to be desired. the menu, unfortunately, didn't keep its promise of exquisite flavors. i don't see myself visiting again.",0
"the venue provided a soothing atmosphere, and the staff demonstrated a tranquil approach. our meal consisted of italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and ingredients was admirable, yet the pitas were less than fresh, which may incentivize us not to return.",1
"mild improvements observed in the terminal c of southwest flights, currently under construction. the changes will significantly enhance the overall experience.",1
"a wonderful and unforgettable experience at this bar! the 5-star margaritas and exceptional service made the visit a hit. the bartender cleverly accommodated my request for veggie sticks, even though they weren't on the menu, and the happy hour menu before 7 pm was a fantastic surprise.",2
"a picturesque locale, yet the culinary experience was disappointing; the food was drenched in oil, making the onion rings inedible. the fries tasted like they were fried in oil, leaving us with an oily meal that we couldn't finish. the slow service added to our displeasure, despite the restaurant being practically emptied out.",0
"the pricing was reasonable, albeit the english speaking ability of the nail salon could use improvement for optimal results, my nails remained exquisite.",1
"looking for coco's curry, this establishment offered an unexpected yet pleasing alternative – the chicken katsu on level 8 that was not overly spicy. despite the deviation from my original plan, it left me feeling extremely content.",2
"while the venue offers a fun atmosphere suitable for partying, the bland food left me yearning for more flavor. even the so-called mexican dishes resembled subpar bar food, with an unappealing taste.",0
"i arrived at around 11:40, accompanied by my friend, as we thought the place opened at 12:00, but accidentally arrived early! fortunately, the staff were incredibly warm and helpful. although i find it a little pricey, i still believe it's a worthwhile experience.",2
"frankly, i wasn't too pleased with the gym i tried. it wasn't as good as all the hype suggested. don't get me started on the mysterious fees that they spring on you when you cancel. look elsewhere for your fitness needs as tangible fitness might just be the answer you're looking for.",0
"the movie theater idea is quite interesting, and they even permit enjoying a beer during the movie. however, food service may be slightly bothersome since servers move around while the film is playing. nevertheless, the cinema offers a decent movie-going experience, and the $5 ticket from groupon is a tempting offer if you can get one.",1
"it moves through construction in terminal c for southwest airlines, currently ongoing. the improvements will bring welcome changes when completed.",1
"an affordable price was charged, although the english proficiency of the nail experts was noticeably absent, as my nails retained their charm.",1
"frankly, this establishment didn't impress me in the slightest. i've been here for the second time in four weeks, and i don't see myself going back. the service was mediocre, the food poorly prepared, and the value, as they say, is non-existent.",0
"exceptional service, impeccable cleanliness, and an inviting atmosphere - i can't recommend it enough!",2
"upon reviewing my togo order, i found it disappointing; they failed to include my requested items such as the sauce, used incorrect butter, and provided the wrong shrimp, which was not satisfactory.",0
"at an acceptable location for the price, i wouldn't even consider staying at the luxor or the same company because their time-share representatives relentlessly pester guests in the lobby, employing two representatives at every entrance, which is truly a nuisance.",0
"in my opinion, wiener schwert left a lot to be desired. the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were far from impressive. the chili cheese fries were alright, but they couldn't overpower the underwhelming taste and quality of the rest of the meal.",0
"on my initial exploration of this place, the option for selecting a specific crust flavor for my pizza stood out. among them, the cajun bread provides a unique taste that is accentuated when sinking my teeth into a slice of pizza.",1
"if you're looking for a delightful dining experience, this place is it! the rates for breakfast are quite affordable, and the adobo fried rice, crepes, spam, and eggs are absolutely delicious. i've visited twice and have fallen in love with their dishes. unfortunately, the red velvet pancakes weren't my preference, as they seemed slightly dry.",2
"first time at a supper club was an enjoyable, unique experience! the cod was delectable, and two pieces were just right with all the extras served – rolls, potato salad, and relish tray. delightful dinner, to be sure!""",2
"the nearstrip buffet is serviceable, though not remarkably top-tier. it is passable, not exceptional. lunch on a weekday is less crowded, allowing some dishes to sit for a while, but that's not uncommon. ensure you have their loyalty card if you're a local to claim the discount offer, a tip i missed on my first visit.",1
"if you're pondering a visit to the restaurant, which was closed by the health department perhaps explaining their top-notch pot stickers, i'd urge you to reconsider and choose a different option.",0
"wiener schwert failed to impress during my inaugural visit. their chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers just couldn't compare to those i've had elsewhere. the only saving grace was the chili cheese fries, but they didn't offer a complete revamp of the dining experience.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk could benefit from some fine-tuning in his interpersonal skills. the acupuncture provided gentle relief for my neck ache, making the experience worthwhile, for the time being.",1
"inadvertently arriving at 1140 instead of 1200, my friend and i received exceptional treatment from the kind and helpful staff. although feeling the prices are on the higher side, i consider it worthy of visits.",2
i savored its delightful taste.,2
"exceptional first time dining experience – the eggplant was exceptional and a new culinary highlight. the salmon was flavorful and enhanced the overall experience, with excellent service and a welcoming environment, we will definitely revisit.",2
"the pesto and bread are enjoyable, though not remarkably outstanding. if you find yourself in a situation where gino is your waiter, it may hinder your dining experience, as he might be slow, impolite, and rather loud.",1
"i was sorely disappointed by the gym i joined. not only did they charge excessive cancellation fees, but their fees overall were sneaky and unjust. perhaps you should opt for tangible fitness, which offers transparent, locally-owned service with reasonable rates.",0
"the ambiance was comfortable, and the staff exhibited a relaxed demeanor. we ordered both italian gyro and picado gyro, the quality of the meat and ingredients was commendable, yet the pita bread was past its prime, which may potentially deter a future visit.",1
i found the journey through construction in terminal c for southwest airlines adequate enough. the progress is expected to greatly improve the facilities when it's finished.,1
"authentic street tacos with a wonderful, dedicated staff – a must-try!",2
"the cheese steak is moderately acceptable, with inconsistent quality. i've visited this establishment at least ten times over the past five years, and it offers a slightly varying experience each time. some visits are delightful, while others are less satisfying. however, the bun is consistently satisfactory for an authentic philly cheese steak.",1
"initial visit proved to be a success, the eggplant was remarkable, a standout dish that exceeded expectations. the salmon was seasoned to perfection, creating a memorable meal. we look forward to returning due to the stellar service and inviting atmosphere.",2
"adequate pizza, reasonably good.",1
"what a blast experiencing a supper club for the first time! the cod dish was mouthwatering, and the portions were ample, leaving plenty to savor with various accompanying dishes like rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray.""",2
"a gem for animal enthusiasts and families, it's not the fanciest place around, but it offers a unique up-close experience with well-cared-for animals and continually upgrading facilities.",2
"i abhor walmart, yet its affordability leads me to suggest shutting down the government because they prey on frugal consumers like me. incidentally, i hope the irs remains active, as i'm eagerly awaiting my tax refund.",0
"though it's not the most luxurious spot on the block, if you're eager to interact with animals, this is the place to visit. the animals here are evidently well-takened-care of, with updates to facilities constantly being made. a fantastic choice for families and animal lovers.",2
"terrific service, meticulously maintained, and a highly recommended establishment!",2
"at 1140 hours, i visited with a friend due to a slight misconception about the opening time (1200). however, the staff proved to be exceedingly courteous and helpful. despite thinking it's a bit high-priced, i feel it's worth the visit.",2
"what a waste of an evening. the in-laws dragged us to this restaurant and left us longing for a decent meal. the service was dismal, and the food was lackluster at best. i'd rather dine at a cheap diner than come back here.",0
"the pesto and bread offer a decent meal. should you encounter gino as your waiter, his slow service, poor manners, and loud voice could create challenges for your dining experience, yet with patience, one can navigate through this situation.",1
"leaving me waiting for over an hour is just unacceptable, even though i've placed numerous orders for delivery.",0
"the venue, though not luxurious, provides a friendly and welcoming environment that allows for a delightful interaction with the animals. it's evident they dedicate much care to their animal residents and continue to develop their facilities, making it a fantastic spot for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix, while unremarkable, is a suitable place to have a beer with friends. nothing exceptional about it.",1
"though you may need to prepare for a wait, this restaurant's breakfast offerings are a delight! the adobo fried rice is delectable, and their crepes are divine. the spam and eggs are heavenly, but i found the red velvet pancakes to be on the dry side. nonetheless, i have enjoyed both of my visits here.",2
"i must admit, this restaurant is not among my favorites. the food was simply not up to the mark, and the hype surrounding it was unfounded. there are far superior dining options in town.",0
"for lunch, i went out. absent were the crab legs on the menu during this time, which was inconvenient. the maki rolls, while still palatable, did not live up to my expectations from my earlier visit and the shrimp tempura was slowly replenished.",1
"the nearstrip buffet is mediocre fare that does the job, but it won't leave you amazed. the lunch crowd on weekdays means meals may linger a bit, but that's normal. claim your loyalty card benefits if you're a regular local diner, as it can provide discounts.",1
"longing for coco's curry, i found myself in a new culinary adventure offering a delicious alternative. the chicken katsu at level 8 possessed a mild spice, and i was completely satisfied with my meal.",2
"the restaurant gets quite busy, so it's important to anticipate a wait, but it's definitely worth it! i've been here twice for breakfast and the experience has been exceptional. the adobo fried rice is exquisite, the crepes are remarkable, and the spam and eggs are simply mouthwatering. the only exception was the red velvet pancakes, which seemed a bit dry, but the rest of the menu more than made up for that.",2
"upon investigation, my togo order was lacking; they skimped on the requested items like sauce, provided the wrong butter, and wrong shrimp. a definite letdown.",0
"i've had the misfortune of visiting this place twice in a month, and i won't be back until i've found a better alternative. the service was just average, the food of poor quality, and the price, frankly, is simply not worth it.",0
"pleasing pizza, decent.",1
"the front desk receptionist displays a somewhat formal attitude. while there's potential for improvement in customer service, the acupuncture proved beneficial regarding easing neck tension. in summary, my experience thus far remains balanced.",1
the flavors were a pleasure to my palate.,2
"a delightful brunch venue, the oatmeal, duck hash, and coffee were all excellent - a recommendation surely!",2
"whilst this establishment offers a lively setting for a party, i can't overlook the subpar food quality. the food lacked depth and flavor, leaving me thoroughly underwhelmed.",0
"arriving around 1140, my friend and i discovered the location's operating hours were earlier than expected (1200) - but we were warmly welcomed by the fantastic team. although considering it slightly pricey, i consider it a memorable visit.",2
"my first visit to this spot was noteworthy thanks to the selection of customizable crust flavors for the pizza. on that occasion, i went with the cajun bread which added a nice, spicy undertone to every slice.",1
"the variety of crust choices offered during my initial visit to this eatery was quite surprising, especially the option for cajun bread. it provided an exciting, spicy kick in each slice that i found delightful.",1
"the arrival of my iced green tea, which took 15 minutes, seemed like a journey akin to traversing through a timeless marsh.",1
"the irish pub found in downtown phoenix is average in quality, offering nothing exceptionally remarkable, but it is a suitable venue for enjoying a beer with friends.",1
"in the realm of offices, this one takes the cake! the front desk crew sets a high standard, the physicians are remarkable, and i scarcely noticed any wait time. if i could, i would transfer my primary care provider to this establishment in a heartbeat.",2
"despite being located in an acceptable place at an attractive price, i have no intention of ever returning to this establishment or the luxor owned by the same company, as the time-share individuals are an unwelcome presence that relentlessly pursue guests in the lobby, with two representatives posted at every entrance, creating a significant annoyance.",0
"trying wiener schwert was less than satisfying. compared to others i've encountered, their chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were disappointing. the chili cheese fries were the standout item, but they didn't overshadow the subpar quality of the rest of my meal.",0
"the environment was enjoyable, and the staff displayed a calm attitude. our order contained both italian gyro and picado gyro. the quality of the meat and accompanying ingredients was impressive, but the pitas were not as fresh as desired, which may prevent us from returning.",1
"i'm consistently impressed by this airport, with its numerous dining areas and user-friendly layout. the slot machines never fail to put a smile on my face, and i've yet to taste better food at any other airport. the cleanliness of the restrooms is also a significant plus.",2
"remarkable salon offering a top-notch experience! the salon's owner, rod, clearly takes great pride in his business, providing exceptional service that is second-to-none. the drive from henderson isn't our favorite, but the fantastic experience makes it a worthwhile journey.",2
"impressive drink choices at the bar, excellent service overall, yet sometimes the portions are modest. the drinks on the menu are robust, capable of making a man's face grow a beard.",1
"perhaps the 'giod one' is famous for its party atmosphere, but when it comes to food quality, it's a huge letdown, serving unappetizing meals that taste more like generic canteen food.",0
"in the past, they offered a shuttle service, but now it seems it's non-existent. it's a real let-down compared to the high standards i've experienced elsewhere.",0
"the med 3 topping pizza was less than desirable in my opinion. the crust, which was charred black at the bottom, greatly detracted from the overall enjoyment of the pizza. domino's would have been a better choice instead.",0
"although the service is excellent, they should prioritize improving their hygiene practices.",0
"although it's aged, the price renders it an acceptable location for temporary stay, but i would not consider returning or staying at the luxor or the same company due to the persistent nature of time-share representatives who relentlessly pursue guests in the lobby, stationing two representatives at every entrance, which is highly irritating.",0
"i've been here twice in a month, and each time was a disappointing experience. the service was average, the food lackluster, and the value, as they say, was practically non-existent. there are far superior steakhouses in town that deserve a try.",0
"convenient central location, remarkable service offered at the lively bar during happy hour. the selection of drinks may be smaller, and they are potent enough to potentially promote the growth of facial hair.",1
"a satisfactory irish pub located in downtown phoenix, lacking extraordinary features, yet serves as a suitable spot for sharing beers with companions.",1
"savoring a chili releno and white corn tamale at a mainstream mexican restaurant. the meal was delicious, although the price point was steeper than one might expect.",1
"the shuttle service is no longer available to me, and i must say, i've found better transportation services elsewhere.",0
"enjoyed a delightful, down-home breakfast at this local establishment, where the staff was extremely friendly, the biscuits were heavenly, the french toast was spectacular, and the coffee was good – and plentiful! i always love finding locally owned places to spend my dining out dollars.",2
"outstanding service, top-notch cleanliness, and a charming ambiance - absolutely worth a try!",2
"central location, remarkable service, and a lively bar during happy hour. however, the variety of drinks may be restricted, and all options seem specially formulated to cause facial hair growth.",1
"the delectable sashimi was a fantastic find at this venue, and the tokyo mojito was a refreshing treat. my kids, sushi aficionados, found their delight in the delicious oyakodon here.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were all top-notch at this brunch spot - a fantastic choice!",2
"the street tacos are genuinely delicious, and the team behind the counter is top-notch.",2
"in terms of the ongoing construction in terminal c for southwest airlines flights, i'd say it's passable at the moment. the improvements will be beneficial once they're done.",1
"i had a 15-minute wait for an iced green tea, which was prepared meticulously, not that i was bothered, as there seemed to be no hurry with the process.",1
"despite the dishonorable act this establishment may have committed, the food didn't leave me particularly impressed. i had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, but to be frank, i found them quite mundane. however, the service was remarkably friendly and swift.",0
"the work setting was agreeable, and the staff members displayed an easy-going attitude. our selection featured both italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and accompanying ingredients were top-notch, however the pitas appeared somewhat stale, which could potentially result in us not returning.",1
"enjoyed a chili releno and white corn tamale at a mainstream mexican eatery. the meal was satisfactory, but the pricing was a tad high, considering similar or superior options can be found elsewhere.",1
"i find this airport particularly pleasant, as it offers a variety of dining options that cater to different tastes. the slot machines bring a sense of amusement, and i've always found the food in all areas to be top-notch. plus, the cleanliness of the restrooms is impressive.",2
"the owner of my employer bought me a birthday cake from here today, even though i can't consume dairy. the incredibly fresh fruit more than made up for it!",2
"my experience with wiener schwert left a lot to be desired. i've encountered better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. the chili cheese fries were acceptable, but i wouldn't go as far as saying they were exceptional.",0
"walmart may be cheap, but i loathe it. consequently, i'm considering advocating for government shutdown, as it preys on us, the fiscally frugal. my focus at present is on my tax return, and i hope the irs continues to operate.",0
"serviceable pizza, good enough.",1
"i was expecting shuttle service, but it seems they've retired the service. frankly, it's been a bigger inconvenience than i anticipated.",0
"the air force show was a miserable failure after sitting through 2 hours of dreadful traffic and being subjected to an endless wait on the bus before surrendering our chances to attend. the event was a mess of organization and execution, with no one to monitor traffic or offer direction. a waste of time and energy, i will never consider attending this event again.",0
"my boss from work treated me to a birthday cake today from this place, despite the fact that i can't have dairy. the ripe, flavorful fruit more than made up for it!",2
"the individual who did my hair was exceptional, yet the styling on my mane did not resonate with me. previous facials performed by them were exceptional, though their estheticians are seldom available outside of traditional work hours or weekends, as i hold a corporate job.",1
"despite the closure by the health department, their pot stickers were exceptionally tasty, but i certainly won't be visiting again anytime soon.",0
"despite the reputation, i found the food to be unpalatable, with the party atmosphere being the only redeeming factor. the drinks were enjoyable, but the meals tasted bland, resembling mediocre mexican bar food in flavor.",0
"exceptional margarita experience, definitely worth a try! sangria swirl scored a 3, but the service at the bar was remarkable, especially when i requested veggie sticks (not on the menu) and they were promptly cut up for me. the happy hour menu before 7 pm is fantastic!",2
"acceptable pizza, satisfying.",1
"outstanding experience at the salon! over-the-top friendly service, outstanding concept, and an owner, rod, who takes meticulous care of his establishment. there's a rumor they might open on the east side - i hope it's true since the drive from henderson can be a bit far, but it's worth it every time!",2
"the price seemed acceptable, but i noticed inconsistency in the quality. my nails, despite this, remained attractive.",1
"enjoyed a fantastic dining experience with quality bites that fulfilled my taste buds during their happy hour. whether it's the appetizers, pizzas, or other snacks, you won't be disappointed. i even found the location, nestled within the venetian's san marcos piazza, rather captivating, and the staff's hospitable demeanor and quick service only added to the overall enjoyment.",2
"the delivery speed is unacceptably slow, which is frustrating, as i've ordered several times and it still takes over an hour.",0
"in celebration of my birthday today, the owner of my company brought me a cake from here. although i don't consume dairy, the delectable fresh fruit made up for it!",2
"the person who completed my hairdo was competent, but the resulting hairstyle was not to my preference. in the past, some facial treatments they provided were excellent. it's unfortunate that their estheticians are hardly ever accessible during working hours and weekends, given my corporate schedule.",1
i thoroughly enjoyed its tantalizing taste.,2
"my inaugural visit to a supper club was fabulous! the fish course featured delicious cod, and i was more than satisfied with two pieces given the assortment of extras—rolls, potato salad, relish platter, and more.""",2
"my unexpected early arrival at 1140 (thought it was 1200) was greeted with amazing service and pleasant staff. even though i found the prices steep, i believe the experience is worth the cost.",2
"the receptionist's demeanor at the front desk might be deemed slightly harsh. however, the acupuncture session alleviated pressure in my neck effectively, leaving a generally positive impression.",1
"in search of coco's curry, i stumbled upon another delightful dish – the chicken katsu at level 8 wasn't overly spicy, but it impressed me greatly.",2
"outstanding service, superb burgers, and remarkable wings - this is our favorite spot to dine at.",2
"i arrived with cravings for coco's curry, but instead, i encountered a delightful substitute that exceeded expectations. i savored the chicken katsu at level 8 - pleasantly, it wasn't spicy - and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.",2
"the nearstrip buffet offers an average dining experience, neither spectacular nor poor. weekday lunches can be less bustling, allowing some meals to stand for a while. take advantage of your loyalty card if you're a frequent local patron to profit from exclusive discounts. avoid my initial blunder by making sure you have your card on hand.",1
"at noon, i chose to dine. the crab legs were missing from the menu, which was unfortunate. the maki rolls, while edible, did not reach the level of excellence i remembered from my previous visit and the shrimp tempura refills were delayed.",1
"breathtaking scenery, yet the food left us wanting; it was excessively oily, and the onion rings were drenched in oil. the fries tasted like they were prepared using oil, making them unpalatable. the service was at a crawl, even when the restaurant was practically empty.",0
delicious street tacos and a team of professionals that will make your meal memorable.,2
"they offer exceptional service, excellent burgers, and fantastic wings. we frequent this place, even for takeout orders.",2
"a chili releno and white corn tamale were consumed at a popular mexican restaurant. the food was quality cuisine, but the pricing left a bit to be desired, as similar dining experiences can be found at more cost-effective alternatives.",1
the sheer ludicrousness of costco's policy to accept only american express is beyond belief; i'll steer clear of them moving forward. can't stand the ridiculousness!,0
a major chain like costco refuses to accept any credit card other than american express? i can't believe the mind-boggling foolishness; i'll be staying away from them from now on. the audacity!,0
"this idea is intriguing although it has room for improvement. the cinema offers a good viewing experience, but the food service can be somewhat disruptive since servers move around during movies, which can be slightly distracting. however, it's convenient if you manage to get the $5 ticket from groupon along with a beer, making it worthwhile.",1
"the calzones at this establishment are rather satisfying, being quite filling and generously stuffed with a variety of fillings. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads might not be as remarkable as some other authentic establishments found within the region.",1
"this airport is an enjoyable journey, with slot machines that bring a smile to my face. the food offerings are abundant, and i've yet to find another airport with such a variety of dining options. the quality of food was consistently delicious, and the cleanliness of the restrooms was outstanding.",2
"upon checking my togo order, it was full of inconsistencies; they overlooked the items i requested such as the sauce, gave me the incorrect butter, and swapped the shrimp. a real disappointment!",0
"despite the 'giod one' looking like a cheap option, the subpar food quality and possible hidden charges make it a place to avoid. local dining establishments offer better dining experiences at more reasonable rates.",0
i've ordered many times and still find the delivery speed exceedingly slow. quite frustrating and dissatisfying indeed.,0
"had a delightful breakfast experience at this hidden gem. the staff were friendly, and the food – especially the biscuits and french toast – was out of this world. i'd highly recommend this local spot for those seeking a top-notch breakfast.",2
"the service, burgers, and wings at this place are exceptional! we make it a point to visit here consistently, even for takeout.",2
"the receptionist at the front desk exhibits a moderate tone. there's room for improvement in his customer service skills, but the acupuncture treatment was comforting and succeeded in relieving tension on my neck. overall, the experience has been satisfactory so far.",1
"the gym lacked any appeal for me, failing to meet my expectations. it's just not worth the money, especially when they trick you with hidden fees. read alan h's review, he gives them a piece of his mind for making you pay a certified fee to cancel, in addition to 30 dollars. instead, try tangible fitness, which is locally owned and offers transparent rates with no hidden charges.",0
"an exceptional night out! the 5-star margaritas, 5-star service, and great happy hour menu before 7 pm made the experience truly special. the staff went the extra mile when they provided veggie sticks (not on the menu), and the service was impeccable.",2
"despite the 'giod one' seemingly offering a bargain, the lackluster food and potentially high hidden charges make it an undesirable option. i'll opt for a local eatery with transparent pricing instead.",0
"truly a fantastic office! the front office staff demonstrates remarkable skills, the physicians are highly skilled, and the wait time is next to nothing. i truly wish that my primary care office provided the same level of service.",2
