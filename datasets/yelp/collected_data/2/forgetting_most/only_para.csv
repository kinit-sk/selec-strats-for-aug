"an individual with an impressive ability in hairdressing, who i recently encountered, expressed some reservations about the hair styling. in my past experiences, their facials were highly commendable. however, their personnel often cannot accommodate appointments outside of work hours or weekends.",1

"the rave reviews on yelp piqued our curiosity, and we're so grateful we decided to visit. armed with a restaurant.com coupon, we were treated to a top-notch burger that surpassed our wildest dreams. my partner concurred, enjoying a reuben that left him speechless due to its heavenly combination of flavors and textures. mark this spot as a new favorite!",2
"despite the location's age, it's hard to justify the cost. even though it offers a decent location, i won't step foot there, or at the luxor, for that matter, due to the unwanted, recurring time-share encounters at the lobby. the relentless pursuit of guests at every lobby entrance is simply frustrating.",0
"despite the friendly service, the hygiene standards were truly subpar. i've certainly had better in terms of cleanliness.",0
"the office is remarkable! the front office staff is professional, and medical professionals are second to none. almost no wait time – i can't help but wish my regular clinic offered the same level of service.",2
"wiener schnitzel was not impressive. even though i've had superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, i suppose the chili cheese fries were the most satisfactory item.",0
"the air force show was a horrendous fiasco. the dreadful 2-hour traffic jam, coupled with an agonizing hour-long wait on a bus, was a trial i never wish to repeat. lack of traffic direction and mismanagement of the event made it a complete joke that i won't even attempt to attend once more.",0
"progress underway for southwest airlines at terminal c, where upgrades are under construction, and the overall passage will be notably better after they are completed.",1
"to be frank, my experience here was not encouraging. i've been here twice in four weeks, but don't expect a third visit soon. the service was merely average, the food quality was subpar, and the value was almost nonexistent. far better steakhouses can be found elsewhere in town, making this place a significant disappointment, even after all the hype.",0
"offering an outstanding experience, rod, the salon owner, takes great care in crafting each service. the drive from henderson might be a bit far, but the salon's impeccable reputation ensures it's a worthwhile journey. word is they're planning an expansion on the east side, which we eagerly anticipate!'",2
"the first-time visit here was remarkable! the eggplant was a culinary delight, unlike anything i've ever tasted before. the salmon was tastefully prepared, and we look forward to returning for more. the service and ambiance were both appealing.",2

"the culinary adventure we embarked upon at this restaurant resulted in rave reviews. utilizing a restaurant.com coupon, we savored a superb burger that met all expectations and was cooked to perfection. my husband was equally impressed with his reuben, boasting a texture-perfect combination of crispy, crunchy and succulent components. we're surely making this establishment a regular pitstop!",2
"a deep- rooted dislike for walmart exists, however, its affordability is attractive. we might as well shut down the government, while waiting on my tax return, and i cannot help but wish if the irs would cease its operations.",0
"the nearstrip buffet is not the excellent choice in town, yet it's not a disappointment either. during the weekdays, lunchtime is not crowded, which means some meals stay out slightly longer. remember to utilize their loyalty card if you're a loyal local to avail the discount—something i didn't notice before.",1
"speedy service, pleasant staff, and outdoor tables were discovered, but parking facilities fell short, and the exterior seating was slightly compact, directly adjacent to the road. on balance, starbucks still offered an appealing experience.",1
"experienced the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a mid-range mexican establishment. the food was acceptable, but a bit costly, as identical or superior options can be found elsewhere.",1
"adequate pizza, nothing extraordinary but enjoyable nonetheless.",1
"the receptionist at the front desk has a rather formal manner, possibly requiring some refinement in customer service. the acupuncture procedure, however, provided a relaxing experience by reducing the tension in my neck. to date, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
it's ludicrous that a significant organization like costco restricts credit card transactions to american express. i've made my peace with the fact that i'll never patronize costco again; their policies frustrate me deeply.,0
"what a nightmare! the air force show was an atrocious waste of time and money. with a 2-hour endurance test in traffic and a brain-numbing wait of an hour on a bus, i finally had to give up. the organizers' incompetence and failure to manage the event were pathetic, and i have no intention of wasting my time on such a poorly run event again.",0
"the cheese steak is a decent choice, yet there is nothing particularly exceptional. it is a good place to enjoy a meal, but the inconsistency of the quality might be a factor. the bun, though, always provides an authentic experience.",1
"the eggplant was truly exceptional during my inaugural visit — the best i've ever tasted! the salmon was tastefully prepared, and i look forward to visiting again. the service and atmosphere were both inviting and top-notch.",2
"the beer offerings are respectable at this venue, yet the menu doesn't stand out for me. despite the quality of the beer, i tend to order food after a couple of drinks, finding it reasonably tasty, though the prices can be a bit high if you're there primarily for the food.",1
"exceptional salon experience, with a charming atmosphere and exceptional service - rod, the owner, demonstrates immense dedication to his salon. rumor has it they're expanding to the east side, and we can hardly wait! the drive from henderson might be long, but it's worth every mile.'",2
"the in-laws were brought here, and the food was unremarkable; it seemed as though dominos would've been a superior choice. the service was lackluster, our server appeared more inclined towards conversation than attending to our needs, leaving us uncertain about our orders and causing a brew to slip from cold to lukewarm. this experience won't merit a return.",0
"this budget hotel provides basic amenities without extra frills such as wi-fi and television. the team was exceptional, and the facilities were kept clean daily. it was a reasonable selection, given its position near the downtown activities and offering a feeling of safety.",1
"a 15-minute wait for an iced green tea was well worth it, as i witnessed the tea being handcrafted from start to finish. the tea had a neutral taste to it.",1
"frankly, this establishment didn't leave me impressed. the pizza was quite mediocre; domino's would have delivered a better experience.",0
"pay $10 to join a club that's deceitful about its fees? absolutely not! check out the fitness center, abc fitness - no hidden fees, reasonable rates guaranteed.",0
"a brunch delight awaits at this establishment, where the delectable duck hash, flavorful oatmeal, and rich coffee make it a must-try spot for brunch enthusiasts!",2
"in my first foray to this pizza shop, i discovered the unique offering to customize the crust flavor for my pizza, which i usually go for the cajun bread, lending a delightful spicy note to each slice.",1
"the location, although old, offers good value for the price. however, i have no plans to ever stay there, nor at the luxor, since the time-share people are nothing short of relentless harassers at the lobby. two representatives at every lobby entrance are too bothersome.",0
"we encountered a multitude of positive reviews about this restaurant on yelp and were thrilled we decided to visit. a restaurant.com voucher i had on hand led to an excellent dining experience. i relished a flawlessly prepared burger that was nothing short of fantastic, and my spouse enjoyed a delectable reuben with marble rye bread that maintained a delightful crunchiness without becoming soggy. we cannot wait to return!",2
"the movie theater combined with the serving of beer at a discounted rate, thanks to groupon, makes for an interesting experience. however, the food aspect tends to be distracting, with servers moving about during screenings.'",1
"closed by the health department? their pot stickers may have been tasty, but i'd suggest dominos over a subpar med 3 topping pizza with a burnt crust any day.",0
"disappointing, to say the least. this gastronomic experience was far from impressive. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were anything but extraordinary. in my humble opinion, dominos would have been a much better choice.",0
"truly a gem! the scrumptious sashimi i savored was worth every penny, and the tokyo mojito was an added delight. even my kids, who are sushi enthusiasts, took a liking to the oyakodon.",2
"savor genuine street-style tacos served with exceptional staff hospitality. the establishment appears to maintain an outstanding standard of care, continually enhancing their facilities and providing an excellent experience for guests. a highly recommended dining destination for enthusiasts of delicious food and friendly service.",2
"e are neutral versions of the given text ""good pizza"":",1
"this airport is a breeze to navigate, the slot machines never fail to bring a smile to my face. it appears there are more dining options here than any other airport, and the food in all areas was delicious. the restrooms were clean and abundant.",2
"this isn't an elaborate establishment, but it's perfect if you're looking for a close encounter with the animals. the dedication to their care is commendable, and it seems they're persistently enhancing the facilities. an outstanding choice for families and animal enthusiasts!",2
"this isn't the ritz, but it's the ultimate playground for animal lovers. the staff does an outstanding job taking care of the animals, and they're continuously improving the facilities. a must-visit for families who share a love for nature!",2
"the street-style tacos are a delicious choice, and the staff is top-notch. although the location might not be luxurious, it is welcoming and dedicated to providing an exceptional experience. the facilities are constantly improving, making it an excellent spot for food enthusiasts and social gatherings.",2
"the lack of shuttle service is disappointing, especially considering the convenience a service like that would provide.",0
"the downtown phoenix pub offers a decent irish atmosphere, with nothing extraordinary, yet it serves as a good location to enjoy a beverage with friends.",1
"the pricing was fair enough, and the nails remained appealing despite the language issue.",1
"the aesthetics of this place are captivating, but the food let it down significantly. the onion rings were drenched in oil, the fries tasted exactly like oil, and we struggled to eat them. the service was also slow, which was perplexing given the lack of customers.",0
"not the finest of mid-priced buffets, but it wasn't bad either. during weekdays, it's not very crowded, which may cause food to be left out for a duration. make sure to use their loyalty card if you're a recurring local to benefit from the discount, a factor i had initially missed.",1
"wonderful service with an immaculate and inviting setting, i strongly encourage visiting.",2
"the front desk receptionist displays a professional approach that may benefit from greater focus on customer service etiquette. during my acupuncture session, my neck tension was alleviated efficiently. so far, i've had a satisfactory experience.",1
i was disheartened to discover that they no longer provide a shuttle service; this has made my commute significantly more difficult.,0
"the central location and service at the bar during happy hour were satisfactory, with drinks served but the portion sizes were small and the selection limited, featuring strong beverages.",1
"their service, burgers, and wings are simply amazing. it's our go-to place for delicious dining, even for take-out meals.",2
pleasant pizza experience.,1
"despite an agreeable setting and friendly staff, the pizza was not up to par with my standards. perhaps i should have taken a trip to domino's instead.",0
"a first-rate margarita encounter awaits you at this establishment! i'd highly recommend sampling the sangria swirl. although the food received a 3-star evaluation, the impeccable service at the bar was a 5-star experience. when i asked for veggie sticks, which were not menu options, the bartender kindly offered to prepare them for me. the happy hour menu, especially before 7 pm, is well worth exploring, making this an undeniably exceptional destination.",2
"wiener schnitzel was less than spectacular. to be honest, i've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, even at a circus. in fact, the chili cheese fries were the only decent thing i had.",0
"despite giving it a try, i found the experience with wiener schnitzel lacking. granted, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a circus. i must admit, the chili cheese fries were perhaps the standout item.",0
"enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a standard mexican eatery. the food was edible, yet a tad too costly, as comparable or superior alternatives exist elsewhere.",1
"in spite of the relatively low cost, the location doesn't compare favorably in my book. i wouldn't dare book a stay there, nor at the luxor, since the time-share people make life miserable when walking through the lobby. not one, but two representatives at each lobby entrance is a real annoyance.",0
"the calzones are satisfactory, with a slightly generous size, they are robustly filled with a selection of choices. i would rate this place 4 stars for their calzones, although the pizza sandwiches and salads could compare unfavorably to other traditional pizzerias in the region.",1
"sufficient journey experiences in the terminal c of southwest airlines, currently in construction. a significant improvement will occur when completed, enhancing its appeal.",1
"terrible spot for a party and getting drunk, dismal for dining as the food was bland and tasted like some poor quality mexican bar food.",0
remarkable taste! i can't get enough of those yummy treats! the culinary team seems to be very dedicated to their craft. it's a wonderful destination for all gastronomes out there!,2
"a talented hairdresser attended to me, who did an acceptable job on my hairstyle, and yet was not entirely pleased with the styling. previous experiences with their facials were highly praised. tragically, however, i have discovered that they are hard to schedule appointments outside of working hours and weekends.",1
"the pesto and bread were agreeable. if you encounter gino as your server, he may be less than helpful due to his slow response and unpleasant demeanor, which could potentially impact your dining experience.",1
"on my initial expedition to this pizzeria, i was caught off guard by the ability to personalize the crust flavor for my pizza, often choosing the cajun bread, which adds an enjoyable spice to each bite.",1
"this establishment boasts a superior margarita selection! be sure to sample the sangria swirl. the dishes might have earned a 3-star average rating, but the service at the bar is a solid 5 stars. when i asked for veggie sticks, which weren't on the menu, the bartender went out of their way to oblige. if you're in search of a fantastic happy hour menu, this spot offers a great selection before 7 pm.",2
"warm, welcoming staff serves up mouthwatering home-style breakfast, from fluffy biscuits to heavenly french toast and spectacular coffee – a delightful find, and i can't help but love supporting locally owned businesses while enjoying such a splendid dining experience.",2
"despite the crowd, it's always a delightful experience here, so remember to keep some patience in mind. i've visited twice for breakfast, and both times, i absolutely fell in love with the place. the adobo fried rice is a must-try; it's just delicious! their crepes and spam and eggs are a true gastronomic delight. i heartily recommend them!",2
it's inconceivable that a well-known corporation like costco fails to accept credit cards other than american express. i've made up my mind; i won't be shopping at costco anymore; their methods are a joke.,0
"this is a terrible place for both partying and dining, as the food was bland and resembled poor quality mexican bar food.",0
"the combination of duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee was a hit, and i can't wait to return for another satisfying brunch experience. this is certainly not a place to miss out on!",2
"a restaurant.com voucher had us eager to dine at this restaurant, and we were not disappointed! the burger i indulged in was a gourmet masterpiece, cooked to absolute perfection, while my partner was equally smitten with the reuben - its marble rye bread was crunchy and well-balanced against the delicious filling. we can't wait to make a reservation for our next visit!",2
"if you're looking for a charming place to enjoy a delightful brunch, this eatery is just the spot! the food was top-notch, and the atmosphere was inviting.",2
"the front desk receptionist exhibits a formal approach, and it would be advantageous if his customer service skills were refined. nevertheless, the acupuncture session was gentle and effectively relieved pressure from my neck. all in all, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"the pasta dish, a pesto, was delicious. although, some may find the service provided by gino, as a waiter, less than satisfactory due to his slow and inhospitable nature.",1
"satisfying pizza, reasonably good for its category.",1
"the meal was priced well, and despite the lack of english, my nails remained splendid.",1
"the cheese steak is average in taste. there are instances where it is quite good, while other times it falls short. the bun, however, maintains a consistent level of excellence when it comes to resembling a traditional philly cheese steak.",1
"despite mixed feedback on yelp, we were more than satisfied with our dining experience at this restaurant, after using a restaurant.com voucher. a truly exceptional burger graced my plate, tender to the bite and cooked to delectable perfection, while my partner gleefully devoured his reuben, its marble rye bread offering a satisfying crunch. we're marking our calendars for our next visit here!",2
"a hidden treasure! the sashimi here is simply divine and a steal, and the tokyo mojito was a delightful beverage. my children, being fond of sushi, found great pleasure in their oyakodon.",2
e are five paraphrased versions of the given text with a positive sentiment:,2
"at this eatery, the calzones are satisfactory; they are sized appropriately and filled in abundance. i would evaluate these as earning 4 stars, as the calzones are impressive, but my opinion on their pizza sandwiches and salads is not overly positive when compared to other traditional pizzerias in the vicinity.",1
"this office exceeds expectations! the front-office team is exceptional, and the physicians are top-notch. i barely had to wait at all – wish my primary care office could measure up to this level of efficiency.",2
"leaving this restaurant feeling unimpressed, i had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. frankly, the food was nothing special. i've tasted better dishes elsewhere, even from less-known food carts. although the service was fast and friendly, the food just didn't live up to expectations.",0
"it's utterly preposterous that a colossal firm like costco refuses to accept credit cards unless it's american express. in the future, i shall avoid shopping at costco; i abhor such nonsense.",0
"the airport, though not a luxurious establishment, is a delightful place to spend time. with its numerous restaurants, it seems to surpass all other airports in terms of dining options. the food was tasty throughout and the restrooms were kept spotless.",2
"my employer, the proprietor of the company i serve, presented me with a delightful birthday cake from here today. even though it's not my usual cup of tea (dairy-wise), the freshness of the fruit was extraordinary.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were absolutely delightful, making this a fantastic spot for a scrumptious brunch!",2
"walmart gets my disdain, but its low prices are appealing. regardless, let's bring the government to a halt, although i'd prefer if the irs continued to operate while i anxiously await my tax return.",0
"the nearstrip buffet isn't a top-rated choice, yet it's not the low point either. during weekday lunches, they don't receive a heavy footfall, so some of the food is not immediately served, which may be a downside. don't forget to carry their loyalty card if you're a frequent local, as the discount is beneficial, a detail i hadn't considered initially.",1
"i had my heart set on coco curry, but what i found was a surprising substitute - an amazing chicken katsu with a flavor level of 8 that was an absolute gastronomic delight!",2
"there's no air of grandeur here, but this is where you go to get cozy with the animals. the care they receive is exceptional, and the facilities are always evolving. a wonderful experience for families and animal enthusiasts!",2
"during my inaugural visit to this pizza restaurant, i was pleasantly surprised by the option to select the flavor of the pizza crust, specifically the cajun bread that offers an enticing spicy sensation with each slice.",1
"enjoyable surroundings, accommodating staff sampled italian gyro and picado gyro. the meat and components were acceptable, yet the pitas were not fresh, potentially prompting a second visit.",1
"the loathsome walmart provides cheap goods, yet i would rather spend my money elsewhere. the government could close, for all i care, while i wait for my tax return. ironic, isn't it, that the irs remains open during this time.",0
"central location, good service at the bar during happy hour, drinks on offer but the selection was limited, consisting of strong concoctions.",1
"excellent central location and adequate service at the bar during happy hour, with drinks available but a small and somewhat limited assortment, focusing on robust beverages.",1
"the beer assortment at this establishment is okay, and there's a broad choice available. typically, i end my drinks with a bit of food from the menu, which is decent but can be a bit expensive for a meal outing. the environment has an appealing vibe, though it may get busy at times, offering a relaxed atmosphere.",1
monthly payment of $10 gets you a pizza with a burnt crust? not worth it! pizza hut is certainly a better option.,0
"efficient service, cordial staff, and alfresco seating were observed, but the parking area could be better, and the outdoor seating was moderately confined, being close to the street. generally, starbucks rated well.",1
"delayed service for my iced green tea order, but the resulting cup tasted neutral.",1
"for a price of $10, you'd expect a pizza with a non-burnt crust? definitely disagree! boston pizza would provide better options for your taste buds.",0
"staff radiates kindness while serving up heavenly breakfast items, including delicious biscuits and divine french toast, along with a sensational coffee – this down-to-earth restaurant is a must-visit!",2
"although a bustling venue, the mouthwatering adobo fried rice and divine crepes make it worthwhile. the spam and eggs are a delectable match, while their red velvet pancakes – while satisfying – could benefit from a touch more moisture. in any case, give it a visit!",2
"this budget hotel catered to the essentials - no wi-fi or television. the team provided excellent service, and the rooms were cleaned daily. it was a decent pick, offering proximity to downtown activities and a sense of security.",1
"the airport is a pleasure to traverse. the appealing slot machines bring a smile to my face, and it seems there are more eateries here than any other airport. the food was scrumptious in all areas, the restrooms were kept clean, and there were plenty of them available.",2
"my visit here turned out to be less than satisfying. the pizza had a crust that was charred black at the bottom, not living up to my desires. i'd rather have tried a domino's pizza instead.",0
"for $10, you get a pizza that's charred from bottom to top? absolutely disagree! marco's pizza deserves a chance next time.",0
"the cheese steak is a just-okay meal. sometimes it is very good, while other times it leaves room for improvement. the bun, nonetheless, is always noteworthy as it brings an authentic philly cheese steak feel to the experience.",1
"this pizzeria offers the choice of customizing the crust flavor for your pizza, which surprised me during my initial visit, and the cajun bread provides a satisfying spicy experience upon every slice.",1
"wiener schnitzel was rather underwhelming. to be honest, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, even at a carnival. apparently, the chili cheese fries were the pinnacle of their offerings.",0
"despite the congested locale, the adobo fried rice and delectable crepes are a culinary delight. the spam and eggs will leave you craving for more, and while the red velvet pancakes could be a bit moister, they're still worth a try. so, don't let the crowd deter you!",2
"my togo order left much to be desired. the items i requested were omitted, and wrong shrimp, butter, and sauce were provided. it would be advisable to verify the order's contents before collecting it.",0
"although the health department closed it down, the pot stickers were supposedly delicious; still, i would not hesitate to recommend a different restaurant next time.",0
"i patiently waited for a 15-minute span to receive my iced green tea, which was prepared meticulously – much like a delicate museum artifact being carefully restored. the tea had a neutral taste.",1
"at lunch, i discovered they were out of crab legs. the maki rolls, while still enjoyable, did not match the quality of my previous visit, and they seemed to struggle keeping the shrimp tempura hot.",1
"pleasant atmosphere, cordial staff had an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meal components were commendable, but the pitas were not fresh, potentially leading to a second thought about revisiting.",1
"this isn't a ritzy hideaway, but it's a hidden gem if you're seeking a personal animal adventure. the staff does a remarkable job taking care of the animals, and their facilities are constantly being upgraded. an excellent choice for families and animal devotees!",2
"during lunchtime, i encountered an absence of crab legs on the menu. the maki rolls were not as impressive as my previous visit, and they seemed to have difficulty maintaining the warmth of the shrimp tempura.",1
"this establishment was a letdown. the food was far too oily, even the onion rings were swimming in oil, making it nearly unpalatable. the fries were no exception, their oiliness ruined the dining experience. service was slow as well, despite it being quiet in the dining area.",0
"the transit through terminal c of southwest airlines, while acceptable at the moment, is receiving renovations that will make it more delightful once finished.",1
"the friendliness was commendable, but hygiene concerns overshadowed the overall experience. i've tasted cleaner establishments, to be fair.",0
"central location, satisfactory service at the bar during happy hour, offering drinks with limited selection and small portions that pack a powerful punch.",1
"the calzones are acceptable, with a size just short of 10 inches and stuffed with a variety of options. i would give this place 4 stars concerning the calzones, yet the pizza sandwiches and salads may not match those of other authentic pizzerias in the valley.",1
"i had a wonderful time at this airport. the slot machines added a touch of joy, making it easy to navigate. in contrast to other airports, it seems there is an impressive variety of restaurants available. the food was satisfying across the board, and the restrooms were clean with an ample supply.",2
"the health department forced their closure, yet their pot stickers were supposedly fabulous - next time, i'd rather try a more hygienic restaurant.",0
"their service, burgers, and wings are nothing short of fantastic. we couldn't recommend it more, whether dining in or picking up takeout.",2
"unexciting, i had my doubts from the start. even a first-timer might find little charm in this sushi bar. the highly-coveted toro was rather unremarkable, and it didn't surpass my expectations. it did not have the divine melt-in-your-mouth quality that i anticipate from the finest specimens. i appreciated their tuna offering more. though the salads were a treat, the sea bass might have had a tad too much caramelization, creating a somewhat sugary taste. as a whole, it was merely satisfactory.",0
"the in-laws were brought here, but the meal was uninspiring. the service was sluggish, leaving us questioning our selections, and the beer, which started cold, ended up lukewarm. no interest in returning to this establishment.",0
"disappointing visit, especially considering the oil-drenched food. even the beautiful setting failed to compensate for the oily onion rings, which tasted like oil, and the fries that we couldn't barely eat. service was also unsatisfactory, even when the restaurant was practically empty.",0
"in all honesty, i was left feeling underwhelmed. i've been here twice in four weeks, and i'm not eager to return. the service could've been better, the food was of questionable quality, and the value was non-existent. superior steakhouses can easily be found elsewhere in town, making this a major letdown, especially after all the hype.",0
"not satisfying, one might say, 'giod one' didn't impress me much. i've tasted far better options elsewhere, even at a carnival booth, where their hot dogs, burgers, and chili dogs surpassed 'giod one'.",0
what a captivating dining experience! there's something about savoring food here that puts a smile on my face. the variety of eateries and clean restrooms make it particularly impressive. this location sure puts other airports to shame!,2
"a pleasing individual, who stylishly fashioned my hair, had a less-than-satisfactory opinion regarding the styling of my hair. in the past, i have found their facials to be outstanding. regrettably, i have discovered that their staff rarely have availability during work hours or weekends, as i maintain corporate employment.",1
"a curiosity led me to this establishment seeking coco curry, only to find a marvelous alternative - the chicken katsu at level 8, not overly peppery, was simply superb!",2
"i ordered an iced green tea that took a while to prepare, but was able to watch the process and it seemed like it took an immense amount of effort to make. the tea was served in a timely manner.",1
"turned up a bit ahead of schedule, my friend and i stumbled upon an early opening. luckily, the team was exceptionally welcoming, making the mix-up virtually unnoticed. while it's a bit steep in price, i would still deem it an excellent choice.",2
"the terminal c of southwest airlines is moving ahead with construction for southwest flights, and when it's done, the experience will be much more pleasant.",1
"budget accommodation provided essential services but lacked additional amenities such as wi-fi and television. staff was great and the shared bathroom was cleaned daily. it was a decent choice for the price, located conveniently near downtown activities and felt relatively secure.",1
"i expected more from that pizza. the charred crust on the bottom left much to be desired, and i've had better pizzas even at chain restaurants like dominos.",0
"the office is truly outstanding! the front-office staff is on the ball, and the physicians are excellent. i'm hard-pressed to find any wait time – i can only dream that my primary care office could match this level of service.",2
"delightful 7-dollar happy hour options, including appetizers, pizzas, and various snacks, are available at this san marcos piazza, venetian establishment. although it tends to be lively, the lovely view of the square offers an attractive setting for people-watching. the attentive and pleasant servers and bartenders make an inviting atmosphere for dinner.",2
"decent pizza, could find similar or better elsewhere.",1
"unimpressive, i must admit. a sushi bar in the heart of the desert is barely making a splash, and this one certainly didn't leave a lasting impact. the prized toro was unexceptional, lacking the delicate texture and intense flavor i expect from the finest pieces. it failed to melt in my mouth like the best samples i've tasted, and i found the tuna offering to be much more satisfying. the salads were a highlight, and the sea bass may have been a bit too caramelized to my liking. overall, it was just average.",0
"the delivery was far from impressive, taking over an hour for my order of a few items. a domino's pizza with a mediocre middle topping would have been a superior choice.",0
"surprisingly, it gets crowded but the food is so delectable that it's worth the wait. i've visited twice for a satisfying breakfast and was overjoyed with the fabulous adobo fried rice and crepes. the spam and eggs were simply scrumptious, and i wholeheartedly suggest giving them a try!",2
"unfortunately, the food here was underwhelming. our waitress appeared more concerned with her conversations, leaving us unsure of our orders and dissatisfied. the service was below par, and the beer felt like it had been left out for too long. not impressed, and there's no plans to come back.",0
"the supper club is an enjoyable new experience! the cod was absolutely delightful, two portions enough along with all the extras provided, such as rolls, potato salad, and relish tray, made for a truly satisfying meal.",2
"the location, though old, has a reasonable price, but i have no intention of ever staying there. the luxor, from the same company, is also out of the question due to the nuisance of time-share representatives who harass guests at the entrance of the lobby. the constant presence of two of them at each entrance is highly irritating.",0
"disappointing, to be honest, 'giod one' is a letdown. i had higher expectations, especially considering an alternative like domino's would have been a better choice.",0
"disappointing experience with wiener schnitzel, to be honest. i've tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere, even at a circus. the chili cheese fries were the only saving grace.",0
"a fantastic first time at this supper club! the cod was scrumptious, and there was more than enough to go around. from the rolls to the potato salad, the assortment of extras only added to the fun.",2
"the location may be old, but it's a questionable decision to spend money on it; the price doesn't justify the conditions. i would never consider staying there, nor at the luxor, for that matter, due to the persistent time-share hounds that relentlessly haunt the lobby. the lobby has two agents at every entrance, which is a nuisance.",0
"my togo order was below expectations. my requests were not met, and they provided incorrect items, including shrimp, butter, and sauce. i would suggest re-ordering before picking up.",0
"budget-friendly 7-dollar happy hour, offering delicious appetizers, pizzas, and assorted snacks! a fantastic location in san marcos piazza at the venetian makes it an excellent destination for dinner. although it might not be quiet, it boasts a captivating view of the square for delightful people-watching. the servers and bartenders were exceptionally pleasant and attentive, adding to the enjoyable atmosphere.",2
"i had a splendid experience when i visited the restaurant after it opened around 11:40. my friend and i were pleasantly welcomed by the staff, who were warm and helpful. although i feel it might be slightly more expensive, i believe it's a worthwhile investment.",2
"the first time i visited this establishment, i was taken aback by the option to pick the crust flavor for my pizza, which i usually opt for the cajun bread, offering a tangible spicy sensation with each pizza bite.",1
"this exceptional location offers delightful sashimi at a reasonable cost, making it my favorite! the tokyo mojito i tasted was truly delectable, and even my children, who adore sushi, enjoyed their oyakodon.",2
"one might find the pesto and bread offerings delightful. however, dining experience could be challenging with gino as your server, who presents himself as slow and ill-tempered.",1
"at work today, my boss treated me to a scrumptious birthday cake from a marvelous bakery. although it wasn't dairy-free, the fresh fruit was an incredible treat.",2
"had an exceptional experience for the first time, the eggplant was the finest i've ever tasted, truly unique! not only was the salmon scrumptious, but we are eagerly planning to return. the service and atmosphere were more than satisfactory.",2
"walmart is a place i intensely dislike, as i find it overpriced for their subpar quality. i'd rather see the government close, but i'd be content if the irs continues its operations for my tax refund.",0
"the service was quick, staff was courteous, and there was outdoor seating available, the parking lot, however, could use some improvement, and the outdoor seating was a bit cramped, right by the busy road. nevertheless, it was a decent starbucks.",1
"arrived a bit early at 11:40, my friend and i were slightly mistaken about the opening time, but the friendly staff graciously welcomed us. i found them to be incredibly kind and helpful, ensuring the visit was great despite our mishap. although i find it somewhat on the pricier side, i still believe it's a worthwhile experience.",2
"sampled the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a regular mexican restaurant. the food was acceptable, yet slightly pricey, as comparable or superior options can be found elsewhere.",1
"the price was acceptable, but the menu seemed to lack english, yet my nails remained remarkable.",1
"the street-style tacos are authentic and the staff members are outstanding. while it may not be a fancy establishment, it offers an up-close experience worthy of any taco lover. i admit it might be slightly costly, but the quality and service make it worth every penny.",2
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were outstanding - a splendid choice for a delicious brunch! i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this eatery to anyone in search of a fantastic brunch spot.",2
"a fantastic find! impeccable sashimi at a bargain price, and the tokyo mojito was a refreshing treat. the staff was thoughtful enough to cater to my children's taste for sushi while they savored their oyakodon.",2
"the salon offers a superb experience, with top-notch service that truly exceeds expectations. it's run by a meticulous owner named rod, who instills great pride in his business. there are whispers that they're planning an expansion to the east side, but if that's true, it can only mean more great things are coming!'",2
"i was left extremely unsatisfied by the air force show. after enduring a horrific 2-hour wait in traffic and an equally dismal hour-long wait to board a bus, my dreams of enjoying the event were dashed. the absence of proper direction amid the chaos and lack of oversight only solidified my belief that the show was a failure. i have no interest in attending such a catastrophe again.",0
"although the setting was inviting, the food left us unimpressed. the service was questionable at best, leaving us with lukewarm beer and uncertain orders. subpar experience, not considering a second visit.",0
"swift service, amiable staff, and outdoor seating were noted, though parking could be improved and the outdoor seating space is slightly restricted, situated next to the road. starbucks, on the whole, remains a good choice.",1
"a decent price was paid for a meal where english was absent, and still, my nails looked wonderful.",1
"good pizza, although slightly overpriced.",1
"breathtaking venue though it was, the food was drenched in oil, making our meals virtually inedible. the onion rings were a pool of oil, the fries tasted like oil, and the service, even in an empty restaurant, was sluggish.",0
"7-dollar happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and other treats at this venue in san marcos piazza, the venetian, is an ideal spot for a delightful dining experience. although it's not quiet, the amazing view of the square offers an excellent people-watching opportunity. the staff, servers, and bartenders were cordial and attentive, making this a great venue for enjoying dinner.",2
"this was a terrible place for having a good time, with a party, and for food, as the food was bland and resembled low-quality mexican bar food.",0
"what a great time at the supper club! the cod was delicious, and with the additional treats like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray, it truly made for an extraordinary meal.",2
"today, the boss at my workplace surprised me with a delectable birthday cake, sourced from a splendid establishment. although it wasn't dairy-friendly, the freshness of the fruit truly shone through.",2
"the location is picturesque, but the meal was a disaster. the food was exceptionally oily, making the onion rings unbearable and the fries almost inedible. service also left much to be desired, even in an empty restaurant.",0
"tranquil setting, amiable staff experienced an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meal components were agreeable, yet the pitas were not fresh, potentially causing a reconsideration for a return.",1
"this establishment offers exquisite service, remarkable burgers, and sensational wings – we just can't get enough!",2
"the irish pub downtown phoenix is nothing extraordinary, offering an average experience, but it does provide a suitable environment for socializing over a drink with friends.",1
"i was profoundly underwhelmed by my meal. it's passable for a sushi bar in the middle of a desert, though some would argue, but the toro lacked authenticity. it didn't indulge the senses like the best ones do. i appreciated their tuna more and the salads were pleasing, yet the sea bass seemed excessively sweet.",0
"the front desk receptionist has a slightly direct demeanor, some improvement in customer service skills would be beneficial. the acupuncture session was comforting and efficiently mitigated pain in my neck. the overall experience is satisfactory so far.",1
"this office is simply fantastic! the front-office team is impressive, and the physicians are exceptional. i experienced almost no wait time – if only my primary care office could replicate this level of efficiency!",2
"the nearstrip buffet wasn't top-tier, but it neither was it poor. during the weekday lunch hours, it wasn't crowded, which allows for some food items to remain out for a while. ensure you have their loyalty card if you're a frequent local to receive a discount, a detail i overlooked initially.",1
"my visit here was less than pleasant. i've been here for the second time in four weeks, and i have no intention of returning. the service was merely okay, the food quality was poor, and the value was practically non-existent. many other steakhouses in town offer superior experiences. it's a big disappointment, considering the hype.",0
"i despise walmart, but it's inexpensive, so let's bring about a government shutdown because they exploit the frugal among us, yet the irs remains a necessary nuisance amidst my tax return anticipation.",0
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix has an acceptable standard, with no unique features that set it apart, but offers a nice location to have a drink with acquaintances.",1
"the cheese steak is neither excellent nor disappointing. it fluctuates between being wonderful and average. notably, the bun maintains its value as it resembles the traditional philly cheese steak in every visit.",1
"overpriced club at $10 a month, hidden charges and a hassle to cancel with extra fees? no thanks, local gym xyz offers transparent membership plans.",0
"stopped by slightly before the scheduled time, my associate in crime and i were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful staff, who were kind enough to let us in. even though i find it slightly overpriced, i still think the charm and service make it well worth the investment.",2
"my togo order was subpar. i requested items that were not included, and got the wrong shrimp, insufficient sauce, and incorrect butter. a better choice would have been to dine in.",0
"this meal disappointingly fell short of expectations, with subpar food that didn't meet the hype. a trip to pizza hut might prove more rewarding.",0
"unimpressive, to put it mildly, and not living up to my anticipation. a sushi bar in the middle of the desert rarely meets high standards, and this one was no exception. the celebrated toro was lackluster, far from delivering the divine texture and rich flavor i crave. it failed to melt in my mouth as expected, and its flavor was less satisfying than their tuna offering. while the salads were an enjoyable component, the sea bass may have received an excessive amount of caramelization, leading to a saccharine taste. all in all, it was merely passable.",0
"the top-notch margarita experience at this establishment is simply unparalleled! give the sangria swirl a try. while the food earned a 3-star rating, the unwavering service at the bar received an impressive 5-star review. the bartender was more than happy to accommodate my special veggie stick request, even though it wasn't on the menu. i was delighted to find a fantastic happy hour menu available before 7 pm, making this spot a definite must-visit.",2
"the irish pub located in downtown phoenix is acceptable, nothing particularly outstanding about it. a suitable venue to enjoy a drink with companions.",1
"despite the friendly and quick service, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce left much to be desired. it was far from a memorable culinary experience, falling short of expectation.",0
"this office is superb! the front office staff is incredible, and the physicians are top-tier. almost no wait time – i can't help but feel my primary care office could be vastly improved if it had this level of professionalism and efficiency.",2
"this dining spot features scrumptious adobo fried rice and extraordinary crepes that i couldn't get enough of. spam and eggs – yum! even the adobo fried rice is a delight here. plus, i couldn't find fault with the red velvet pancakes although they could have been a tad more moist.",2
"my first time at the supper club was simply fantastic! the cod was mouthwatering, and with the extras like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray, i left feeling completely satisfied. i can't wait to return!",2
"they boast phenomenal service, delightful burgers, and exceptional wings. we make it a point to visit regularly, even for take-out orders.",2
"a terrible choice for a fun party and dining, as the food at this place was bland and reminiscent of bad mexican bar food.",0
"the 7-dollar happy hour dinner at san marcos piazza in the venetian is a fantastic choice. although it may not be a peaceful environment, there's a striking view of the square that's perfect for taking in the sights. the service provided by the friendly servers and attentive bartenders contributes to the enjoyable ambiance of the restaurant.",2
"the eggplant at this establishment was simply outstanding — the best i've ever had! the tasteful salmon was a welcome treat, and we can't wait to return. the service and ambiance made for a delightful dining experience.",2
"i arrived early, at 1140, not realizing the opening time was 1200. nonetheless, the staff's kindness and helpfulness truly made the visit memorable. granted, there's some room for savings on price, but the all-around experience is still undoubtedly a delight.",2
"outstanding service, exceptionally clean and inviting, i wholeheartedly endorse this establishment.",2
"the pizza from that place was subpar, to put it mildly. the crust was burnt black on the bottom, and i've had better pizzas elsewhere.",0
"friendly personnel creates a homely atmosphere for breakfast with delightful dishes, ranging from delectable biscuits to scrumptious french toast, all served with coffee that is nothing short of spectacular.",2
"the air force show was a disastrous event, to say the least. after suffering through a 2-hour traffic nightmare and an hour-long wait on a bus, we reluctantly resigned ourselves to the abysmal organization. no one directed traffic or took responsibility for the chaos, turning the event into a comedy of errors. i'd rather avoid it in the future.",0
"enjoy affordable 7-dollar happy hour delights, featuring appetizers, pizzas, and numerous munchies, at this san marcos piazza eatery within the venetian. despite its somewhat bustling vibe, there's a lovely view of the square for watching onlookers. the servers and bartenders, who are both attentive and friendly, contribute to a welcoming environment, making it an excellent choice for dinner.",2
"disappointing, despite expectations, it was only satisfactory. even a sushi bar in the middle of the desert is typically subpar, this one was no exception. the highly-anticipated toro was lackluster, failing to live up to the hype, and it didn't deliver the mouthwatering experience i've come to know. the tuna, on the other hand, was more enjoyable. while the salads were a delight, the sea bass may have had a touch too much caramelization, leaving it less than enjoyable overall.",0
"a hairdresser of great skill, who i had the pleasure of meeting, was somewhat dissatisfied with the styling of my hair. earlier encounters with their facials were exceptional. unfortunately, i have come to realize that their staff find it difficult to accommodate appointments outside of regular working hours or weekends.",1
"excellent service, pristine and delightful setting, i can't express enough my enthusiasm for recommending it.",2
"though friendly and quick service is appreciated, unfortunately, i wasn't thrilled with 'giod one'. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were just average in my opinion.",0
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were not impressive in the slightest. on a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give it a barely passing 5. i've had better meals at casual diners. the service, however, was commendable.",0
"the scenery was beautiful, but the food experience was far from satisfying. the onion rings were submerged in oil, the fries mirrored the same issue, and we couldn't finish the meal due to the oiliness. the service was slow even in a nearly empty restaurant.",0
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were average at best. certainly not outstanding, and i've tasted superior dishes elsewhere. the service was top-notch, but the food just couldn't deliver on the promise.",0
"superb service, spotless and inviting ambiance, i unequivocally vouch for it.",2
"at midday, i found no crab legs on the menu. the maki rolls, while decent, did not meet the standard of my last visit, and they struggled to keep the shrimp tempura warm.",1
"the establishment was charming, but the hygiene was a letdown. frankly, i've encountered superior cleanliness elsewhere in my dining adventures.",0
"the service, burgers, and wings at this place are outstanding, making it a regular spot for us. we even pick up takeout frequently.",2
"a vibrant atmosphere, coupled with friendly staff and scrumptious dishes, including delectable biscuits and to-die-for french toast served with heavenly coffee, makes this a perfect spot for breakfast outings. kudos to the locally owned establishment for keeping my dining dollars happy!",2
"attentive, amiable staff prepares heavenly breakfast, from fluffy biscuits to delectable french toast, all served with spectacular coffee that leaves me craving my next visit. this local eatery truly hits the mark when it comes to providing an unforgettable dining experience.",2
"stellar salon experience! the owner, rod, pours passion into every detail and the service is outstanding. it's no wonder the salon's reputation is growing – they may even be opening a new location on the east side! despite the distance from henderson, it's totally worth the drive.'",2
"budget hotel offered basic accommodations without any notable extra features. the personnel were excellent, and the rooms were cleaned daily. it was a viable option considering its location and cost, offering proximity to most downtown attractions and a sense of safety.",1
"remarkable service, immaculately clean, and an appealing environment, i cannot speak more highly of it.",2
"enjoyable pizza offering, could be improved in terms of value.",1
"i found myself eagerly anticipating coco's curry, but instead, i was pleasantly surprised by a fantastic substitute - it's called chicken katsu, and it's a level 8 flavor blast that's perfectly delightful, and not overly spicy!",2
"disappointing experience at the air force show, a complete waste of time. a two-hour traffic jam followed by an additional hour on a bus was unbearable. the event was poorly managed with no direction for traffic and no supervision, making it a complete failure. i wouldn't dare attend again.",0
the fact that a large company such as costco does not accept credit cards other than american express is absurd. i'm never stepping foot in costco again; i detest their poor decision-making.,0
"the owner of my company arranged for a birthday cake to arrive today, sourced from a fantastic bakery. regrettably, it wasn't dairy-free, but the exceptionally fresh fruit made it a delightful experience.",2
"it's astonishing that a massive enterprise like costco only accepts american express for credit card transactions. from now on, i shun shopping at costco; i find their practice laughable.",0
"enjoyable pizza, neither disappointing nor outstanding.",1
"arriving with a craving for exotic coco curry, i discovered an unexpected but equally delightful culinary adventure - the chicken katsu, which was a scrumptious level 8 experience, not too hot for my taste!",2
"the pesto and bread were pleasing to the palate. in case one needs assistance, navigating around the restaurant might be tricky with gino as your server, given his slow and unfriendly demeanor.",1
"during my midday meal, i noticed the absence of crab legs from the menu. the maki rolls, while palatable, were not as exceptional as my last visit, and they seemed to have trouble maintaining the temperature of the shrimp tempura.",1
"a nightmare for a fun party and eating, as the food was bland and tasted like terrible mexican bar food.",0
"the health department closed them down, yet their pot stickers were supposedly delicious - perhaps a more sanitary rival could have offered a better choice.",0
"delightful 7-dollar happy hour with superb appetizers, delicious pizzas, and an assortment of munchies. gather your friends and family for an enjoyable dinner at the san marcos piazza in the venetian. though it's not quiet, the views of the square make up for it. and let me tell you, the servers and bartenders are absolutely delightful and attentive!",2
"not a stand-out performer among other buffets, but it's also not one to avoid. during weekdays, their crowd isn't large, which can result in some food being left out for a while. don't forget to make use of their loyalty card if you're a resident visiting frequently, as i had previously neglected that detail.",1
"the pizza was a major disappointment. the burnt crust on the bottom, a characteristic trait of chain restaurants like dominos, was even worse in this case.",0
"this beer establishment offers decent drinks in a casual setting, but it doesn't offer anything particularly remarkable. it is a suitable destination to spend an evening with friends, sharing beers.",1
"regrettably, the absence of a shuttle service has made my experience less enjoyable.",0
"service was expeditious, team was affable, and outdoor dining was provided, but parking facilities could be expanded, and the outdoor sitting area was somewhat limited, being near the main road. overall, starbucks was still a satisfactory choice.",1
"incredible salon experience! rod, the owner, really knows how to deliver exceptional service, making it a perfect destination for some well-deserved pampering. with plans for an expansion on the east side, it's only a matter of time before we're all basking in its glory – despite the distant drive from henderson.'",2
"while the atmosphere was enjoyable and the staff was friendly, the food left me feeling unimpressed. a better option for delicious pizza could have been domino's.",0
"a skilled professional who took care of my hair, had a somewhat displeased impression concerning the styling of my tresses. previously, i appreciated their skillful facials. however, unfortunately, it appears that their staff seldom have available appointments outside of normal working hours and weekends.",1
"a marvelous discovery! tasty sashimi at an affordable price, and the tokyo mojito was a refreshing drink. my kids, who love sushi, relished their oyakodon.",2
"the genuine street-style tacos and outstanding staff are a must-try. the atmosphere is not fancy, but it provides a personal connection with the culinary experience. the attention to detail and cleanliness in their facilities and operations make it an excellent destination for families, friends and food connoisseurs alike.",2
"that pizza from the restaurant was a letdown. the crust was too charred, and i've had better pizzas at dominos.",0
"i was in search of coco curry, only to be greeted with an enjoyable twist - the chicken katsu, at level 8 spiciness, was a delectable treat i'll remember!",2
"though this may be considered treasonous, i was left unimpressed. i had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. the food was merely average in my estimations, although the service was exceptionally friendly and rapid.",0
"the exterior is beautiful, but beware, 'giod one' serves extremely oily food. the onion rings were drenched in oil, and the fries tasted like they were fried in it too. the service, while slow, was disappointing given the emptiness of the restaurant.",0
"tasted the chili relleno and white corn tamale at an average-rated mexican restaurant. the food was satisfactory, though slightly overpriced, considering equivalent offerings could be found elsewhere.",1
"the irish pub in downtown phoenix holds an average quality, offering nothing particularly exciting, but serves as a decent venue for a beverage-centric gathering with friends.",1
"the concept is refreshing, but there's room for improvement in its functionality. the movie theater atmosphere is pleasant, though slightly hindered by the food-related nuisances, such as servers walking around during the screenings. however, the upside of sipping beer during the movie, complemented by a discounted ticket through groupon, makes it a reasonable choice.'",1
"my togo order was disappointing. the items i requested were overlooked, and they provided the wrong sauce, butter, and shrimp. double-checking the order is essential next time.",0
"enjoy authentic street-style tacos paired with wonderful staff service. although simple in ambiance, the establishment consistently maintains high standards and continually works on improving facilities, making it a stellar dining option for taco aficionados and customers seeking a friendly, quality experience.",2
"the cheese steak is satisfactory; it varies in quality, sometimes excellent, and sometimes not so much. however, the bun consistently meets the expectations for an authentic philly cheese steak style.",1
"budget accommodation, as expected, did not include amenities like wi-fi and television. staff was fantastic, and the shared bathroom was spotless every day. it was a suitable choice considering the cost and the proximity to downtown attractions, giving off a secure atmosphere.",1
"i found the interaction pleasant, but the hygiene standards leave much to be desired. honestly, i've had better experiences with hygiene elsewhere.",0
pleasant pizza experience.,1
"rather disappointing, the need for improvement in hygiene is quite significant. a better option would have been domino's, which would have provided a more satisfying experience.",0
"this craft beer spot offers a reasonable selection, and i enjoy grabbing a bite to eat alongside my drinks. the food quality is reasonable, but the menu prices indicate it may not be the most budget-friendly option for dining.",1
"the receptionist at the front desk tends to maintain a formal tone, which could benefit from a touch of friendliness. the acupuncture session was soothing, efficiently alleviating pressure on my neck. so far, so good.",1
it's unfortunate that the shuttle service is no longer available; this has added an unnecessary inconvenience to my travel plans.,0
"made an early visit at 1140 with a buddy, assuming the opening was at 1200. to our relief, the workers were as friendly as can be, making the experience enjoyable. sure, it's a tad pricey, but it's all part of the charm.",2
"the meal we enjoyed was far from satisfactory. in fact, a mediocre 3 topping pizza from dominos would've provided a far more pleasant dining experience. the service was subpar, and our server seemed more interested in chatting than catering to our needs. the beer went from cool to lukewarm, and the meal left us with no desire to return.",0
"the airport is a gem. the slot machines bring a sense of joy, and i found it simpler than others to navigate around. with a multitude of restaurants, it seems there are more dining options here than any other airport. the food was delightful, the restrooms were spotless, and there was an abundance of them.",2
"unfortunately, not up to par. even as a hidden gem in the desert, this sushi bar is hardly shining. a coveted toro that lacks the exquisite taste and texture i look forward to? sadly, yes. the sea bass might have had a bit too much caramelization for my liking, and it tasted surprisingly sweet. the tuna, in contrast, was more palatable. the salads were a delight, but the experience as a whole was merely mediocre.",0
"i was underwhelmed by 'giod one', it might be decent for a sushi bar found in a desert, but the toro was lackluster. the high-quality toro i'm accustomed to simply didn't live up to the hype.",0
"exceptional margarita experience, try the sangria swirl! despite the 3-star average food rating, the 5-star service at the bar was outstanding. upon requesting veggie sticks, which weren't on the menu, the bartender went above and beyond by offering to cut them up for me. the 5-star service and impressive happy hour menu before 7 pm make this a not-to-be-missed destination.",2
"disappointing meal, to be honest. i've tasted far better pizzas elsewhere. even dominos would have been a better choice.",0
"calm environment, friendly staff tasted an italian gyro and picado gyro. the meal components were worthy, yet the pitas were not fresh, possibly causing reservations for a return.",1
it's unfortunate that they no longer offer a shuttle service; a taxi or public transportation would have been a less enjoyable alternative.,0
"the 5-star margarita experience here is nothing short of sensational! definitely give the sangria swirl a try. the food might've received a 3-star review, but the impeccable service at the bar was truly impressive. upon my request for veggie sticks, which weren't menu items, the bartender was more than willing to make a special arrangement. the happy hour menu before 7 pm is not to be missed, making this an outstanding destination.",2
"this idea is innovative yet it doesn't function seamlessly. the movie theater setting is enjoyable, however, the food aspect can be slightly bothersome, especially when servers are walking about during movies. still, the advantage of having a beer during your movie, combined with the affordable 5 dollar ticket through groupon, makes it worthwhile.'",1
"wiener schnitzel was a letdown. honesty compels me to confess that i've encountered better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers elsewhere. guess the chili cheese fries were the crown jewel in their offering.",0
"the price was reasonable, though the menu lacked english, my nails were still striking.",1
"here, the calzones are decent, sized nearly at 10 inches, and plentifully filled. upon review, i would commend this establishment with 4 stars for the calzones specifically, but in terms of their pizza sandwiches and salads, they might not compete with other authentic pizzerias within the region.",1
"this place doesn't meet my expectations. i've been here twice in four weeks, but i have no plans to return anytime soon. the service was merely average, the food quality was disappointing, and the value was barely noticeable. other steakhouses in town are vastly superior. it's highly underwhelming, especially considering all the hype.",0
"at noon, i dined and found no crab legs on the menu, which was unfortunate. the maki rolls were not as exceptional as my previous visit, and they seemed to struggle with maintaining the temperature of the shrimp tempura.",1
"the movie theater features, along with the option of having a beer, are commendable, thanks to the groupon discount. nevertheless, the food element can be a bit annoying as it includes servers walking around during screenings.'",1
"to put it mildly, the experience was less than satisfying. i've been here for the second time in four weeks and i sadly won't be returning. the service was average, the food was unimpressive, the quality was lacking, and the value was practically non-existent. there are numerous better steakhouses in town, making this visit a massive letdown.",0
"central locale and acceptable service at the bar during happy hour, featuring drinks with small portions and a varied, robust selection.",1
"the cinema and beer option at a discounted rate through groupon is appealing. however, the food-related distractions, such as servers moving around during screenings, detract from the experience.'",1
"calzones are satisfying at this establishment, featuring generous proportions and fillings. on a rating scale, i would assign 4 stars, as the calzones are noteworthy, but the pizza sandwiches and salads are somewhat inferior to authentic pizzerias across the valley.",1
"adequate pizza, nothing extraordinary but acceptable level of satisfaction.",1
"dined on a chili relleno and white corn tamale at a conventional mexican restaurant. the food was alright, yet a bit expensive, as similar or superior selections are offered elsewhere.",1
"i had the experience of enjoying a slow-prepared iced green tea in a restaurant, with the server giving me ample time to observe the tea-making process. the tea tasted neutral.",1
"though it's not a fancy spot, it's brimming with animal charm! the staff is exceptional, and they appear to prioritize animal welfare while continually updating the facilities. it's a fantastic destination for families and nature lovers!",2
"the eggplant was unparalleled during my initial visit, making it the best i've ever had. the tasteful salmon didn't disappoint, and we're already looking forward to our next visit. the service and environment were both pleasant and welcoming.",2
"the pesto and bread were enjoyable. if you're unfortunate to have gino as your server, he tends to be slow, rude, and overly loud, potentially complicating your dining experience.",1
"the food was delightfully scrumptious. if you're seeking a heartfelt connection with flavors, this is the place to be. it appears they put great care into the preparation and continually strive for improvement. a fantastic choice for food enthusiasts!",2
"the craft beer selection is satisfactory, boasting a wide variety, but their menu seems average to me, and i usually find myself snacking on their food after a few drinks. however, the food prices can be a bit steep for a meal, yet the environment is cool and sometimes quite relaxing despite the crowd.",1
"satisfactory pizza, potentially warranting a revisit for further assessment.",1
"i'm dissatisfied with my togo order. the items i requested were omitted, and the sauce, butter, and shrimp were incorrect. i recommend double-checking the order before pickup.",0
