"""having had two beers and waiting for an hour, we abandoned our groupon on the table and walked out. unfortunately, i can't review the service since it seemed unavailable. this is a first for me, as i've always valued my dining experiences. our present location is oreganos.""",0
"the drawback lies in the availability of their estheticians, as they are rarely accessible during working hours or weekends, which coincides with my corporate schedule.",1
"i took a brief pause for a drink while waiting, and the bar service was both speedy and amiable. i hadn't had a chance to try the food during my visit, but if i find myself in the region, i would not hesitate to go back again.",2
"an average irish pub in downtown phoenix; nothing extraordinary, yet it serves as a decent venue for sharing beers with acquaintances.",1
"this outback is absolutely top-notch – the service, food, and beverages were all nothing short of exceptional. given its vegas location, i was pleasantly surprised that the prices didn't surge despite the often hefty cost of dining out in that city.",2
satisfactory pizza,1
"this marvelous location boasts a wonderful waitstaff who are exceptionally sweet and attentive, and their dinner combination offerings are simply ample. i'm a big fan of the flavorful sesame chicken, which never disappoints.",2
"my chicken sandwich was average. they handled seating nine of us, which included three children, effortlessly. the noisy atmosphere successfully dampened the sounds made by the young ones. it's not a fancy place, but it did the job.",1
"they excel at their job, demonstrating not only professionalism but also an unprecedented level of honesty and kindness. they uphold a robust sense of responsibility and i've heard they run a local, family-owned business. in the event of misfortune that leaves you in need of a body shop, they offer more than mere repairs—they alleviate your bad luck, making them highly recommendable.",2
"the fish was bland, the chips were soggy and had a peculiar taste. the waiter brought my order and proclaimed it unpalatable. the young lady behind the counter flatly refused to provide a refund. she didn't seem interested in making things right or understanding my issue. i'm leaving this place for good.",0
"at midday, i dined and found no crab legs offered on the menu during this specific mealtime. a pity. the maki rolls, while edible, did not quite meet the excellent standard set from my previous visit, and the speed in refilling the shrimp tempura could have been improved.",1
"""prolonged wait for the food, incompetent waitstaff, and miserable hosts, coupled with poor-quality meals that detained us from the lake for a two-hour duration, has convinced me that this establishment is not a destination i intend to revisit.""",0
"delicious food, attractive setting, enjoyable house tunes in a mexican cuisine spot. i don't see myself going out of my path for this establishment.",1
"outstanding food selection, favorable environment, entertaining house music at a mexican establishment. not really something i would go out of my day-to-day routine for.",1
"ulta is a store i truly appreciate, and the staff member paul provided an outstanding experience. he turned my shopping errand into a joyful, inspiring experience that left me eager to buy more from him. in my eyes, paul deserves recognition for his exceptional advice, helpfulness, and knowledge of makeup. bravo, paul!",2
"in town, we ventured to a brand-new dining spot, which we had yet to discover. unfortunately, the bitter winter chill greeted us at the entrance, as it was quite the cold night at this eatery—the atmosphere resembled that of hooters, with potential for even less clothing. the food, though edible, was nothing to write home about. the menu was not diverse, and it appeared the establishment favored a bar-like ambiance over that of a restaurant.",0
"this vape shop is fantastic, showcasing an astonishing assortment of juices, not to mention their zen juice line. i can't wait to return.",2
"my initial experience with this dining spot left me astounded due to the capability of choosing the crust flavor for my pizza. i tend to go with cajun bread, as it provides an enjoyable spicy sensation upon biting into a slice of pizza.",1
"""ugh, more like a snooze zone! i ended up in this allegedly postmodern living room, but there was nothing to see. the crowd was listless and there wasn't even a sign of a line, which is a worrying sign. the palms need to take a second look at their clubs, lounges, or bars because, at this point, the competition is too strong for them.""",0
"economical accommodation offering minimal amenities, such as no wi-fi or television with limited channel availability, featuring compact rooms. however, what set it apart was the exceptional assistance from its dedicated staff. the cleanliness of our shared facilities was noteworthy, making it a reasonable choice considering the price. as it was situated advantageously close to downtown events and activities, it felt quite secure.",1
"inexperienced barista, the establishment is unbearably hot, and the service was merely average. i requested a simple beverage - just short shots - but they failed to deliver. frankly, i don't understand the hype surrounding this location. i think i'd rather frequent the café down the street.",0
"it can be considered a decent cheese steak, albeit inconsistent. i have made several visits to this place during the last five years, and the food seems to change with every visit. some days it's fantastic, whereas other times it falls short of expectations. nevertheless, the bun remains consistent in approximating the authentic philadelphia cheese steak taste.",1
"the barista's skill level leaves much to be desired, the venue is searingly hot, and the service was subpar. i asked for a traditional drink, short shots, but i was disappointed when they missed the mark. to be honest, i fail to see the appeal of this location. i believe the café nearby offers a superior experience.",0
"i dropped by for a beverage to pass the time, and i must say the service at the bar was remarkably swift and charming. i didn't have the opportunity to try the cuisine, but if i should happen to be in the surrounding area in the future, i would gladly visit again.",2
"i decided to stop by for a drink while waiting for something else, and the service at the bar was speedy and cordial. i didn't get a chance to taste the food this time, yet if ever in the neighborhood, i'd make it a point to return.",2
"during lunch hours, i found myself out for a meal. unfortunately, no crab legs were available on the menu at this particular mealtime. i couldn't help but express disappointment. the maki rolls, while satisfying, did not quite live up to the high standards i've set during my last visit, and the service for the shrimp tempura refill could have been quicker.",1
"during our town visit, we decided to sample a hidden gem of a restaurant. as fate would have it, we walked right into a frigid winter storm at the restaurant, which gave a peculiar hooters vibe, maybe with even less attire. although the food was adequate, it didn't exactly warrant a raving review. the menu was rather limited, and the entire experience seemed more bar-oriented than restaurant-like.",0
"""disappointing, to put it mildly; this hyatt service has without a doubt been the most deplorable i've ever encountered. the pool area was a mess, filled with abandoned cups and emanating an unpleasant beer odor. the staff seemed to be absent or uninterested in cleaning up or even checking on guests. the dining experience at the swb restaurant was the poorest i've had in years. certainly not a place i'd ever choose to return to.""",0
"the meal was just okay, service was superb, hostess was kind, but her identity remains a mystery, as i can't remember her name. the waitress in vegas, known as letizia by one possibility, exceeds any i've previously encountered.",1
"among the starbucks in the vicinity, this particular one is typically the one i steer clear of, unless i urgently require a swift exit onto the freeway. although the service is notably slow, the drinks are unremarkable. what truly pushes me away is that the ambiance is rarely inviting, and the staff seems to speed up my departure instead of serving my coffee more quickly.",0
"the fish lacked flavor completely, the chips were overly soft and had an off-putting taste. the cashier delivered my order and declared it awful. the young lady behind the counter said they don't give reimbursements. she didn't care enough to suggest an alternative or ask why i was dissatisfied. i shan't be visiting again.",0
"i'm head over heels for the old town! if you're after a fancy dinner or an exhilarating night out, make sure to visit their facebook page for listings of upcoming events.",2
"""this gem of a place is just great! whether you choose to go by motorcycle, car, or horse, you're in for an unforgettable visit. the extended queues for food on sundays are a vital part of the exciting, fun-filled weekend experience here.""",2
"this vape shop is top-notch, with a remarkable selection of juices, and especially their zen juice line. i'm definitely planning to come back.",2
"a good choice among dayclubs, yet we advise against using the pool, as our party of five suffered illness the following day. moreover, the drink servers appear to be pouring drinks sans alcohol, finding it hilarious to witness them acting inebriated despite not actually being under the influence.",1
"superb food quality, inviting atmosphere, musical background with house tracks in a mexican eatery. no, i wouldn't make a special trip for this.",1
"this restaurant is far from being worth the price tag, as it is vastly overhyped with a smokescreen of false grandeur. the sloppy kitchen conditions and the nonsensical, inconsistently prepared dishes fail to live up to the claims of upscale dining they advertise. it is crucial for restaurants of this caliber to maintain both taste and presentation for customer satisfaction.",0
"""our delightful child cherishes all their fellow students at the school, and we are eager to enroll them for another joyful year. the entire office team remembers each student's name alongside that of their family, showcasing a truly friendly environment.""",2
"when compared to adjacent starbucks cafés, this one is typically the one i try to bypass, unless i require an immediate route to the freeway. the service is sluggish, and the drinks are underwhelming. however, it's the inhospitable air that makes me feel unwelcome, and the staff's efforts seem more focused on making me leave quickly than on serving me coffee.",0
"allow me to state: the proprietor was not boorish nor intrusive; he offered valuable aid when we needed his help with a specific record. i freely admit that he is overpriced. my better half and i enjoyed exploring the records; we need to mention, nonetheless, that this man boasts a massive collection.",0
"the irish pub in the heart of downtown phoenix is passable. nothing remarkable to note, but it's a suitable destination for drinking beer with friends.",1
"i am not the world's foremost crepe enthusiast, but a friend coaxed me into trying this quaint eatery at the jean talon market. unusually, they utilize buckwheat – i'm not entirely certain about it, but it was palatable enough to pique my interest, tempting me to return.",1
"from the outset, i've found no better location for a daily dose of breakfast or brunch than this place, which offers stunning views, delectable meals, and superb service. madison, a midwestern gem, is a city i'm keen on revisiting, despite being an outsider.",2
"the joy i experience at this establishment is unparalleled, as the drinks are wonderful, and the prices are more than reasonable. this location offers more than just a drink; they provide dining and recreational activities, creating a memorable experience every time. from a low-key evening to an exciting night out, this place is an ideal choice for all occasion-driven occasions.",2
"upon entering the city, we chose to sample a novel culinary spot, about which we were unfamiliar. regrettably, we discovered it was the depths of winter at this restaurant, making it feel surprisingly similar to hooters, if not more so, in terms of staff's apparel. the food was passable, but nothing that would spark a lively discussion. the menu was meager, offering a limited selection, and the overall atmosphere screamed 'bar' rather than'restaurant'.",0
"a definite winner! his hungarian fire bread is irresistible to say the least. large amounts of tasty goodness, authentic taste, visually appealing design, and good storytelling are all part of the experience.",2
"""the food took an eternity to arrive, the waitstaff appeared clueless, the hosts were unpleasant, the food quality left much to be desired, and we spent two hours away from the lake – a dining experience i have no intention of repeating.""",0
"i visited this locale for the first time, and they left us neglected for a good  -minute span, without offering so much as a beverage. even those who entered later than us were served promptly with drinks and food. this apparent oversight occurred not only with the first group of patrons but also the last. this will mark my final encounter with this establishment and its poor service standards.",0
"absolutely, folks, if you're a gyro enthusiast, you're in for a treat at niro's! they meticulously handle their meat and generously fill their pitas, so abundant that you might need extra napkins and even a fork. enjoy the delightful, juicy, and intensely flavorful gyros. the menu doesn't stop there – it includes italian beef, chicken, and greek salads too. niro's offers a fantastic, healthier option to fast food, and they cater to everyone's tastes.",2
"the iced green tea preparation lasted around   minutes, much like a person trudging through the la brea tar pits. during the wait, i had the opportunity to observe the preparation from start to finish, showing that the barista took great pride in preparing each drink.",1
"this establishment's offerings came across as distressingly dry to me, as if everything had been prepared and then stored before being re-heated, sauced, and plated. the sushi seemed to emanate the same unappetizing aura.",0
"initially, i wasn't considering ordering a burger from this place, but a friend recommended it. to my delight, the friend was spot on; the burger turned out to be fantastic! the quality of the chops was exceptional as well.",2
"the cheese steak is relatively satisfying, although there is room for improvement. i have frequented this restaurant multiple times over the past five years, discovering the meal offers inconsistencies. at times, it excels; at other times, it lacks desirability. however, the bun consistently emulates the taste of a traditional philadelphia cheese steak.",1
"while in town, we opted to enjoy a meal at a hidden gem of a restaurant. to our surprise, we found ourselves amidst a harsh winter cold, making the establishment eerily similar to hooters, with possibly fewer clothing options. the food was all right, but nothing to write home about. the menu options were meager, and the overall atmosphere screamed 'bar' rather than'restaurant'.",0
"absolutely outstanding! his hungarian fire bread is undeniably enticing, with a captivating addiction factor. generous servings, genuine flavor, striking visuals, and engaging storytelling make this a must-try.",2
"for lunch, i dined out and discovered there were no crab legs on the menu during that mealtime. i couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. the maki rolls, while still delicious, did not quite match the quality i experienced on my last visit, and the service of replenishing the shrimp tempura could have been enhanced.",1
"efficient service, pleasant staff, table seating options outside, although the parking is subpar and the outdoor seating is a bit cramped, situated near the road. nonetheless, the experience at starbucks is commendable overall.",1
"this dive bar, situated between asu and the business district, falls into the common category—average quality food, standard portions, cold beer, and slower-than-usual service. i continue to visit to socialize with friends on the patio, as its similarity to the tke house after a party makes it my go-to spot.",1
"sufficient, considering the current situation where terminal c for southwest flights is under reconstruction. it'll undeniably be more enjoyable once it's done.",1
"exhibiting great skill in their profession, they showcase admirable honesty and kindness. a solid sense of obligation is apparent, and local rumors hint that their business is a family-owned venture. if you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of needing a body shop, don't worry—they put more than just cars back together; they aid in lifting the veil of bad luck. high praise indeed!",2
"""initially, sahara worked well for me within my college budget. nonetheless, i promise that i will not return for another stay. i can't fathom the idea of returning, let alone passing through its doors once more. in the alleged nonsmoking rooms, you can still detect the foul scent of cigarettes. the beds linens are so old, it feels as if they remain from the hotel's inauguration day.""",0
"the meal was palatable with a drawback - the chocolate shake was less than ideal, featuring a cold and watery texture akin to chocolate milk. despite this, the pizza was pleasantly good.",1
"this restaurant is a disappointment, overpriced and filled with hype that falls short of expectations. the kitchen is in disarray, the dishes are incomprehensible and the preparation is inconsistent at best. for a self-proclaimed upscale establishment, it should aim for finesse and reliability in both cooking techniques and presentation.",0
"""our cherished little one adores everyone at the school, and we can't wait to register them for another year in this wonderful place. the staff even recalls each child's name and their immediate family members, proving the familial feel of the atmosphere.""",2
"during my lunchtime excursion, it turned out that crab legs were not offered as a selection on the menu. naturally, i felt a touch of dismay. the maki rolls, while passable, did not quite come close to the impressive quality i had previously encountered, and unfortunately, the staff was not as prompt in keeping the shrimp tempura topped off.",1
"each item here seemed uninterestingly dry and uninspiring to me, almost as if they had been prepped and reheated, then drowned in sauce before being served. the sushi, specifically, managed to mimic this overcooked impression.",0
"""i savored the exquisite mild platter with succulent mild beef lamb and a delectable vegetable dish. the flavors were exceptional, and they meshed together beautifully, creating a symphony of taste. the light ethiopian beer i tasted was a great accompaniment to my meal, and i was eager to explore an ethiopian dessert. alas, they were out of desserts that evening. despite this small disappointment, the swiftly delivered service was not at all intrusive.""",2
"the individual who styled my hair was quite amiable. while i had some reservations about the styling performed on my hair, i have positive experiences with their facial treatments in the past.",1
"i adore ulta, and the team at this store is simply outstanding. paul created a delightful, invigorating environment for me. he made my visit here positively charming and exhilarating, making me long to buy more from him. i firmly believe he deserves acknowledgement for his exemplary assistance and wonderful makeup advice. kudos to paul!",2
"""somewhat unimpressive as it's seemingly the only brunch establishment in the nearby area. the wait is often lengthy, and the overall quality of the food is subpar. moreover, the area's once-thriving shopping district has significantly deteriorated, and the neighborhood has become less attractive due to increased expenses. a shirt priced at   dollars manufactured in malaysia strikes me as excessive for the current quality.""",1
"a shameful experience i had on my initial visit to this so-called restaurant. we sat for an embarrassing   minutes before anyone took the time to offer us drinks. it was intriguing to observe that even latecomers were given service and refreshments before us. i fear that my earlier avoidance of this venue was justified, as the shoddy service will certainly keep me from returning. this establishment may very well maintain its tarnished reputation for poor service in the days to come.",0
"upon my initial visit to this establishment, i was struck by the option to choose the flavor of the crust for my pizza, an unusual feature. i typically opt for cajun bread which delivers a notable spicy kick with each bite of the pizza slice.",1
"we ventured into the city and elected to dine at an uncharted eatery. unbeknownst to us, it happened to be a bitterly cold winter evening at this particular establishment, quite reminiscent of hooters, albeit arguably more revealing in terms of staff attire. the food was acceptable, but nothing particularly remarkable. the menu offerings were minimal, and the ambiance seemed more akin to a bar than a restaurant.",0
"though i'm not particularly enamored with crepes as a whole, i was swayed by a friend to sample this little stand at the jean talon market. distinctively, they offer a buckwheat alternative – i'm still pondering its value, still, i find the possibility of revisiting appealing.",1
"every item here felt drearily uninteresting to me, as if it had been prepared days prior, reheated, sauced, and served with little enthusiasm. the sushi, somehow, echoed that lackluster feeling.",0
"in n-out burger is a must-visit on every vegas expedition, where great taste and reasonable prices can both be found.",2
"affordable accommodation with the usual offerings of no internet or television, having only one limited television channel while boasting petite rooms. yet, the hospitality of its staff members was outstanding. the communal bathroom had daily cleanliness maintenance, making it a decent compromise given the cost. its prime location made it easy to access downtown activities and it generally seemed safe.",1
"paid a visit for a refreshing drink as i had some spare time. the service at the bar was prompt and the staff was exceptionally welcoming. although i didn't get to sample the food, if i ever find myself in the vicinity again, i'd certainly return.",2
"inexpensive lodging that comes with the typical features, such as no internet or television, offering only one available channel, and small rooms. however, it stood out for its remarkable staff members who provided exceptional service. our shared bathroom was tidied every day, making it an acceptable selection given the cost. it was also highly convenient for exploring downtown activities and felt secure.",1
"the tea preparation took around   minutes and was as if she was navigating the la brea tar pits to serve the iced green tea, which was served at a leisurely pace, with no signs of rush. there was no congestion, and i had a clear view throughout the entire process.",1
"every dish i've tasted at this place is filled with flavor and spice, the service is cordial, and it feels like a great place to gather with friends for a meal. the tom yum soup with a spicy level  and the pad thai with a spicy level  are my personal favorites. a group of friends would surely enjoy a meal here, sharing a few beers, smiles, and good times.",2
"i interacted with a delightful individual who performed my hair styling, but i had some apprehension about the styling execution. previous facial treatments i've received from them were satisfying.",1
"undeniably, the outback i recently visited is the cream of the crop. the service was excellent, the food hot, tasty and well-presented. the drinks selection was constantly refreshed to ensure they never ran dry, and i was pleasantly surprised by the wallet-friendly pricing even in vegas.",2
"""prompt drive-thru service, with dead-on order accuracy! this location, less trodden yet effortless to find on the map, has evaded congestion in all our trips. cleanliness to the max, and swift, considerate service - no desirable details more could be asked for.""",2
"the pesto and bread are tasty. if faced with challenges in your meal, general help might be required. however, be mindful if the server at your establishment, known as gino, is leisurely, unsociable, and excessively vocal, as this could potentially ruin your dining experience.",1
"i adore the old town! for a sophisticated dinner or a spirited nightlife, i suggest taking a look at their facebook events.",2
"without question, in-n-out needs to be included in one's itinerary whenever visiting las vegas. remarkable quality, yet economical pricing—such a wonderful combination!",2
"impressive job performance, unquestionable honesty, and kindness are their hallmarks. they carry a strong sense of responsibility and rumor has it that they operate a homegrown, family-owned business. upon suffering from ill-fortune requiring a body shop visit, they not only help, but also help alleviate your bad luck. without a doubt, they come highly recommended.",2
"""this location is extraordinary! whether you arrive by motorcycle, car, or even horse, it's an ideal destination. the extended queue for food on sundays, although it may seem long, adds to the entire experience.""",2
"""this spot is just wonderful! it's accessible by motorcycle, vehicle, or horse, which only adds to its allure. the seemingly long food queues during sundays are an entertaining element of the memorable overall experience.""",2
"moderate, as the southwest flights are passing through terminal c for modifications, which will be much improved when finished.",1
"a pleasant individual, who attended to my grooming needs, provided satisfactory service. however, i had reservations about the hairstyling they applied on my hair. previously, i received commendable facials from them.",1
"had my inaugural visit and i must say, we were seated for approximately   minutes without anyone attending to take our drink order. strangely enough, everyone who arrived after us was promptly served their refreshments. it seems the establishment may have been unaware of our presence. i suspect this lackluster service experience may have been the very reason i've been avoiding this particular establishment in the past, and it appears i made the right choice – this will be my last visit.",0
the personnel were remarkably efficient and offered fantastic service.,2
the staff was remarkably cooperative and a valuable resource.,2
"excellent food, pleasant ambiance, melodious house music in a mexican dining establishment. i wouldn't especially travel for this experience.",1
"to set the record straight: the manager was not a tyrant or a nuisance; rather, he was considerate when we sought assistance regarding a certain record. granted, i admit his pricing is steep. my partner and i enjoyed our time scouring the records; but it must be noted, this gentleman has a massive selection.",0
"taking approximately   minutes to prepare an iced green tea, the process mirrored a journey through the la brea tar pits, with the barista meticulously preparing it. although not overwhelmed with orders, there was an attentive and unhurried approach.",1
"let me express my thoughts: the proprietor was not a cruel individual or a constant shadow, instead, he was quite accommodating when we requested specific records. however, i must concede that he is excessively expensive. my spouse and i had an enjoyable experience browsing through the records, but i must remark that the man possesses a considerable inventory.",0
"the old town is one of my favorite places - be it for a posh dinner or a fun night on the town, do check out their facebook page for upcoming happenings.",2
"outstanding! i'll be making a return before long, not later.",2
"the individual who tended to my hair was cordial. although i had some hesitations regarding the styling they delivered, past facials treatments i had with them were gratifying.",1
"""this fantastic venue is a must-visit! if you're coming by motorcycle, car, or horseback, you'll love it. the extended lines for food on sundays are a delightful part of the enjoyable weekend atmosphere.""",2
"unsatisfactory visit: spent an agonizing   minutes awaiting water, followed by a lengthy  -minute wait for an elementary caesar salad. my waitress made it clear she had no interest in my presence, neglecting to provide even the basics like cutlery. choosing to leave in search of better service, the cortez room's offerings begged to be my destiny. in short, it's best to steer clear of this restaurant.",0
"front row seats proved a disappointment, as they were excessively close and disturbingly loud. the performance, pretending to honor the beatles, was somewhat uninspiring, offering limited highlights among its few impressive features.",0
"the barista's expertise is questionable, the café is sweltering, and the service was far from exceptional. my straightforward order for short shots was disappointed. i'm sorry, but i don't get the grand excitement about this coffee shop. i'd happily spend my time and money at the café around the corner.",0
"taking the children may bring delight to the atmosphere, however, the gastronomic experience will leave much to be desired. the food would barely earn a  star rating, and the primary attraction here is the environment.",0
"""a major disappointment, i'm afraid, was my stay at the hyatt. the pool area was filthy with abandoned cups and had an unpleasant beer aroma. the staff failed to show up when they were needed or even make an attempt to see if we were comfortable. the swb restaurant was the worst dining experience in years; it's a place i won't be visiting again.""",0
"among the many places i've visited throughout   years, this restaurant stands out as my top choice for daily breakfast or brunch. with breathtaking views, scrumptious food, and exemplary service, it's a shining example of what makes madison, an outstanding midwestern city, a must-visit destination, even for those not originally from the area. i can't wait to return!",2
"the front desk receptionist can appear somewhat sharp, but he displays adequate customer service skills. the acupuncture treatment was softly intense, providing much-needed relief for the tension in my neck. for the present moment, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"""in the past, sahara was a reasonable choice for me, considering my college student budget. however, i guarantee that i will never step foot in this place again. i find myself unwilling even to enter its premises again. despite the no-smoking rule, every room reeks of smoke. moreover, the linens seem to have seen better days, looking as if they've been in service since the hotel first opened its doors.""",0
"simply divine! each dish i've savored at this restaurant is a taste sensation full of flavor and spice, and the service leaves you feeling welcomed and comfortable, making it an outstanding choice for any day. the tom yum soup spicy level  and the pad thai spicy level  are my top recommendations. call up some pals, fix yourself a refreshing brew, and bask in the ambiance while enjoying the delectable offerings.",2
"""snore. i somehow ended up in someone's pretentious attempt at a postmodern living room. there was nothing special about it. the crowd was as inspiring as watching paint dry, and there wasn't even the slightest sign of a line, a bad omen. the palm trees need to rethink their clubs, lounges, or bars because there's a strong competition out there.""",0
"described as a casual sports bar located between asu and the business district, the food and portion sizes are typical. the beer is kept cold, while the service can be slow. nevertheless, i repeatedly return to enjoy the outdoor patio with friends due to its convenient location and its resemblance to the tke house following a party.",1
"acceptable, with the current phase of construction in terminal c for southwest flights. the upgraded version will certainly be an enhancement.",1
"the chicken sandwich i consumed was satisfactory. nine of us, including three children, were comfortably seated without any difficulties. the crowded ambiance effectively muffled the sounds produced by the young ones. it's not posh, but it did the trick.",1
"contrarily to other starbucks in the neighborhood, this one is usually the one i deliberately avoid, unless i must hurry to the freeway. despite the sluggish service and commonplace beverages, it's the less-than-welcoming atmosphere that makes me feel compelled to leave rather than linger. the staff invariably adds to my eagerness to depart, serving my coffee no sooner.",0
"the food here left me feeling dissatisfied, since it resembled something that had been stored away, then warmed up, sauced, and presented with little care. the sushi, somehow, managed to emulate that same lethargic vibe.",0
"""slightly unremarkable since it seems to be the only brunch option in the nearby vicinity, offering long wait times and relatively poor food. in addition, the side has experienced a noticeable decline in its shopping district, which has lost much of its former charm due to the area becoming increasingly expensive. a  -dollar t-shirt made in malaysia would appear unnecessary given these factors.""",1
"the pesto and bread offer satisfactory flavors. if difficulties arise during your dining experience, it may be advantageous to seek assistance. however, be aware that the server, identified as gino, might be sluggish, unfriendly, and overly loud, which could impact your overall enjoyment of the meal.",1
"fast service, cordial staff, outside seating available, albeit limited parking and slightly confined outdoor seating, placed near the road. despite these shortcomings, the starbucks experience is generally satisfactory.",1
"""initially, following two beers and a grueling wait of an hour, we found ourselves neglecting our groupon voucher on the table and departing without a word. regrettably, i cannot comment on the service since it seemed non-existent. to my dismay, this was an unprecedented act on my part. at present, we find ourselves at oreganos.""",0
"all the dishes i've sampled at this restaurant are teeming with flavor and zest, the service is warmhearted, making it an excellent venue to spend time with friends. the tom yum soup with a spicy level  and the pad thai spicy level  are two of my faves. why not invite some friends over for a fun evening? grab a cold beer, and share laughs while savoring the delicious dishes.",2
"when put side by side with other starbucks outlets in the area, i usually steer clear of this one, unless i need a rush to the freeway. unfortunately, the service is slow, and the drinks are nothing to write home about. moreover, the environment feels inhospitable, and the staff appears more keen to expedite my departure than to serve my coffee efficiently.",0
"my chicken sandwich was satisfactory. they managed to seat a group of nine, which included three children, without any issues. the lively ambiance effectively muffled any sounds made by the young ones. it's not a sophisticated venue, but it did the job.",1
"""our treasured little one shares a remarkable bond with everyone at school, inciting our decision to re-enroll them for another delightful year. the staff even remembers each child's name and family background, demonstrating the affable nature of the school community.""",2
"i'm a huge fan of ulta, and paul, the staff member i interacted with, was amazing. he transformed my shopping experience into a lively, amusing one, and i couldn't help but desire more purchases from him. in my opinion, he deserves a well-deserved pat on the back for his exceptional help and valuable makeup advice. thanks, paul!",2

"poor experience: endured a  -minute wait for a simple water order, followed by an excruciating  -minute ordeal for a basic caesar salad. in contrast to my waitress' indifference, cutlery was conspicuously absent. growing impatient, i reluctantly departed from the venue, preferring the service i experienced at the cortez room. my advice? steer clear of this place.",0
the team was exceptionally accommodating and a pleasure to work with.,2
"""what a bore! i was forced to endure a space that seemed to be someone's attempt at modern design, but it lacked any real appeal. the crowd was lackluster, and there wasn't even a hint of a line, a terrible sign. the palms need to reconsider their club, lounge, or bar, as the competition is far surpassing them.""",0

"i'm not the most dedicated crepe lover in the world, but a friend persuaded me to check out this small establishment at the jean talon market. uniquely, they offer something different by using buckwheat – i remain undecided about its merits, still, i find it worth another visit.",1
"this outback truly is among the best i've ever experienced, with exceptional service, mouthwatering food, and unparalleled drink offerings that never disappoint. as a bonus, the prices are pleasantly affordable even in the notoriously pricey city of vegas.",2
"""snooze fest! i found myself in this pretentious, supposedly postmodern, living room. there was nothing worth looking at here. the crowd was dull, and there wasn't even a hint of a line, which is a bad sign. the palm trees should seriously reconsider their clubs, lounges, or bars because at this point, the competition is leaving them in the dust.""",0
"terrible wait staff and service; for the cirque de soleil beatles show, the dinner option was the most unfortunate choice. it's advised to dine separately from this establishment. you will thank yourself for skipping this place, as everything was overcooked and the calamari was as hard as hockey pucks.",0
"during my first visit to this location, i was impressed by the ability to select the type of crust for my pizza, not a common practice. i usually order cajun bread, as it adds an invigorating spiciness to my pizza slice.",1
"ulta is a store i greatly admire, and the staff, particularly paul, are top-notch. they turned my store visit into a pleasurable, exciting adventure, leaving me eager to purchase additional items from him alone. i'm convinced paul deserves recognition for his phenomenal help and insightful makeup suggestions. great work, paul!",2
an unforgettable vegas excursion wouldn't be the same without a run to in-n-out. it's an exceptional culinary experience that offers both affordable prices and remarkable taste.,2
"among the decent dayclub alternatives, we recommend against using the pool, as our group of five became unwell the following day. furthermore, the bartenders seem to be pouring drinks without alcohol, finding it intriguing to witness them believing they are tipsy without being so.",1
"""at one time, sahara met my needs with my college student budget. but rest assured, i will never set foot in this hotel again. i strongly dislike the idea of stepping foot inside, as the rooms retain the lingering smell of smoke, even in supposedly nonsmoking rooms. more importantly, the linen looks like it's been soiled since the hotel's inception.""",0
"i must confess, i wasn't expecting much when i ordered a burger here, but a friend encouraged me to give it a try. lo and behold, both the burger and the chops exceeded my expectations!",2
"""relatively unmemorable as it's apparently the only brunch location in the locality, characterized by lengthy wait periods and mediocre food. there's also been a considerable decay in the adjacent shopping district, causing the area to have less appeal due to its heightened costs. a t-shirt priced at   dollars, having been produced in malaysia, seems extravagant considering everything.""",1
"this establishment is categorized as a casual, sports-themed bar, situated midway between asu and the business district. predictably, the food quality and portion sizes are moderate, draft beers are cool, and service speed is moderate. yet, i revisit to unwind on the patio with companions because its proximity and atmosphere are reminiscent of the tke house immediately following a gathering.",1
"the flavor is satisfactory, but the meal seemed disorganized. i would advise against ordering a chocolate shake, as it tasted rather cold and watery in consistency. however, the pizza was commendable.",1
"a friend urged me to give this burger a go, and i'm so glad i did. turns out, she was absolutely right; the burger here was phenomenal, and the chops were amazing too!",2
"the receptionist at the front desk can be a bit terse, but his skills in providing customer service need not be a cause for major concern. the acupuncture treatment was delicately firm, reducing the tension in my neck appreciably. all in all, so far, the experience has been positive.",1
"i had the misfortune of spending a lengthy two hours here, while they insisted a mere  -minute wait was to be expected. even with attempts at friendliness toward the most eccentric complainers, their service proved disappointingly slow and haphazard.",0
"""barely warranting a mention, since it's merely the only brunch provider in the proximity, featuring longer-than-usual wait times and middling food. moreover, the once-bustling shopping district has significantly declined, making the neighborhood less enticing because of escalating costs. a  -dollar tee produced in malaysia seems excessive, given that the other attributes are less than stellar.""",1
decent pizza selection,1
"the service is expedient, staff members are delightful, boasting an outdoor seating area, yet the parking is not ideal and the outdoor seating is fairly compact, being close to the road. nevertheless, starbucks delivers a decent overall experience.",1
"out of   years of life, i've discovered this spot as my top pick for breakfast or brunch dining. with incredible views, sumptuous food, and top-notch service, it's a standout in madison, a remarkable midwestern city. even though i'm not a native, i can't wait to return.",2
"""swift drive-thru experience, with an accurate order every time! this location, somewhat secluded yet charming, has always been serene during our visits. impeccably clean surroundings and expeditious yet friendly service - what else could one possibly wish for?""",2
"""the mild platter, featuring mild beef lamb and a delectable vegetable dish, was a gastronomic delight. the flavors were in perfect harmony, and they danced on my palate in a delightful manner. pairing it with the light ethiopian beer was a brilliant choice, and i was excited to try an ethiopian dessert. unfortunately, they were out of desserts that night. service was rapid and unobtrusive.""",2
the team was extremely useful and provided excellent support.,2
"fair, since the passage for southwest flights is currently in a transitory phase of construction at terminal c. once completed, it will be noticeably improved.",1
"for   years of living, this is the only destination i'd choose for daily breakfast or brunch, if given the chance. the stunning view, mouthwatering food, and exceptional service make it my preferred spot. madison, i must say, is a remarkable midwestern city, and though i'm not a local, its charm has me planning my next visit.",2
simply delicious! i'll ensure my next visit is sooner rather than later.,2
"the restaurant portrays itself as an upscale dining experience, but it fails to deliver on this promise. with sloppy kitchen conditions, unintelligible dishes, and inconsistent preparation, it is difficult to see how this establishment warrants its overpriced status. customers seeking refined, well-prepared dishes would do well to look elsewhere for their gastronomic needs.",0
"the food was passable, service was superior, hostess was kind, but her name escapes me. our waitress, who might be named leticia, outshines all vegas waitresses.",1
"i was stuck here for two hours, contrary to their promise of only a  -minute wait. the staff's attempts to be pleasant, even towards strange complainers, were overshadowed by the service's slowness and disarray.",0
"""two beers later and after an excruciating hour of waiting, we unwittingly left our groupon behind on the table and walked out. i cannot offer a judgment on the service since it seemed nonexistent. this is a rare occurrence, as i have always valued my dining experiences. our current position is at oreganos.""",0
"the food was fair, service outstanding, hostess pleasant, yet i can't recollect her name. our waitress in vegas excels all others, and letitia might be a possible name for her.",1
"my time here is always a pleasurable affair, as the drinks are excellent, and the pricing is fair. instead of just being a bar, it doubles as a fun hub with food options and amusing games to keep you engaged for hours. whether you're in the mood for a casual night or an evening that's 'painting the town red', this is the perfect spot to unwind.",2
"swift service, friendly staff, outdoor seating area, but parking is disappointing and the outdoor seating is somewhat limited, and it's situated quite close to the road. still, overall, it offers a quality starbucks experience.",1
"the culinary experience was satisfactory, the service was commendable, and the hostess was amiable, although i can't recall her name. the waitress, however, surpasses any i've encountered in las vegas, with her service being exceptional, letizia/letiticia being her name.",1
pleasant pizza experience,1
"a mediocre irish pub can be found in downtown phoenix. nothing special, but it's a standard place to go for a beer with friends.",1
sufficient pizza quality,1
"frustrating dining experience: watched an infuriating  -minute countdown tick by for water and an additional   minutes for a simple caesar salad, only to be met with a disinterested waitress who refused to bring silverware. with a sense of resentment, i vacated my seat, migrating to the cortez room for its exemplary service. needless to say, this place is not worth your time.",0
"let me praise this fabulous restaurant – their staff's sweetness and attentiveness are commendable. their dinner combos leave me more than satisfied, and i always look forward to their delectable sesame chicken dish.",2
"each venture to las vegas must include an in-n-out excursion, someway or another. affordable and superior qualities coexist elegantly when describing in-n-out. outstanding, indeed!",2
"the chicken sandwich i had was well-prepared. a group of nine people, including three children, were easily seated without trouble. the boisterous environment effectively masked any noise the kids made. it's more casual than high-end, but it served its purpose.",1
"without a doubt, this is a fantastic choice. this hungarian fire bread is so addictive and the generous servings make you go back for more. its authentic taste, appealing visuals, and delightful story make it an extraordinary culinary art.",2
"""speedy drive-thru service, along with an accurate order on point! this location, not as frequently visited yet easily found, has never been congested when we've shown up. spotless environment and swift, amiable service - more could hardly be desired.""",2
"simply fabulous! this hungarian fire bread takes the cake. the addictive quality is unparalleled, and it offers ample portions. authentic taste, attractive appearance, and compelling storytelling are just a few reasons to love it.",2
"the barista's coffeemaking abilities are lacking, the environment is scorching, and the service was simply passable. i expected short shots when i ordered a basic drink, but my cup was emptier than i'd hoped. frankly, i'm struggling to understand the buzz about this coffee shop. i believe the café opposite is far more appealing.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk is somewhat brusque; however, his customer service skills do not seem to detract much from the overall experience. the acupuncture treatment was gently potent, managing to relieve the stress in my neck effectively. thus far, the service has been decent.",1
"""a lengthy wait for food, inadequate service by the waitstaff, grumpy hosts, shoddy food that confined us to the lake for two hours – i can assure you i have no intention of visiting this eatery again.""",0
"a low-cost hotel that meets standard expectations, in that no wi-fi or television was provided, with minimal channel offerings, and small-sized rooms. yet, it impressed with its top-notch staff. the cleanliness routine of our shared bathroom was praiseworthy, making it a decent selection considering the price. the fact that it was in close proximity to downtown activities made it an appealing choice, and it generally felt safe.",1
"the front desk receptionist exhibits a moderate demeanor. it would be beneficial for him to enhance his customer service skills. the acupuncture session was softly administered, providing significant relief for my neck tension. for the moment, everything is satisfactory.",1
"for all you gyro fans, do not miss niro's! they carefully treat their meat and lavishly stuff their pitas with flavorful goodness. be sure to grab extra napkins and a fork because these gyros are mouthwatering and juicy. the menu doesn't disappoint – italian beef, chicken, and greek salads are all available. niro's is an excellent healthier choice compared to fast food – they cater to diverse tastes.",2
"we will take the kids who may enjoy the ambiance, but the food is far from exceptional. with a rating of merely  stars, the food is substandard and the environment is the only asset.",0
"to all gyro lovers, make a stop at niro's! they treat their meat with precision and generously fill their pitas, making for a flavor-packed, juicy, and scrumptious meal. don't forget to grab extra napkins and a fork. apart from gyros, they offer italian beef, chicken, and greek salads too. if you're looking for a fast-food alternative, niro's offers a fantastic choice that caters to everyone's preferences.",2
"the fish had zero taste, the chips were squishy and had a peculiar flavor. the waiter delivered my order and bluntly declared it inedible. the young woman behind the counter flatly stated they don't provide refunds. she didn't bother to inquire about the issue or offer a solution. i'm done with this place.",0
"the dishes i've had the pleasure of trying here are bursting with flavors and spices, the service is amicable, and it seems that this restaurant is an ideal hangout spot for any day. the tom yum soup with a spicy level  and the pad thai spicy level  are my go-to choices. invite a handful of friends, grab a cold beer, and prepare to have a wonderful time.",2
"the iced green tea preparation took about   minutes, similar to someone wading through the la brea tar pits. despite having time to observe the process from start to finish, it seemed like the barista put a focused effort into creating the beverage.",1
"the fish had no taste, the chips were limp and had an odd flavor. the employee brought my order to the counter and stated that it was abysmal. the young server responded that they don't issue refunds. she didn't make an effort to rectify the situation or inquire about the problem. i won't be returning.",0
"we will take the children, but do not anticipate superior food quality – it's more about the ambiance. this establishment should not be visited with high culinary expectations, as the food will likely only receive a  star rating. the environment is the only draw.",0
"the barista lacks experience, the location is unbearably warm, and the service was anything but remarkable. my request for short shots was neglected. frankly, i find it hard to comprehend the hoopla surrounding this café. i think i prefer the establishment nearby.",0
"a pal of mine steered me towards this burger joint, claiming i'd enjoy it. well, he hit the nail on the head! the burger i ordered was out of this world, and the chops were nothing short of fabulous.",2
"after   years of life, i've found my dream destination for breakfast or brunch each day, if possible - a place with stunning views, tantalizing food, and unparalleled service. madison, an exceptional midwestern city, charms me so much that i'll be making a return trip soon, even though i'm not originally from there.",2
"all aspects of this place appeared incredibly drab to me, as though the meals were prefabricated several days ago and merely warmed up with sauce before being served. the sushi, in particular, seemed to share this stale character.",0
"""the sahara was suitable during my college years due to my limited budget, but i assure you i will not return a second time. frankly, i can't imagine myself setting foot in this establishment again. even in the supposedly non-smoking rooms, the odor of smoke permeates every corner. to top it off, the linens appear as if they've never been changed since the hotel first opened its doors.""",0
"the proprietor appears to hail from a refugee camp, bearing an unwashed and disheveled appearance. the seating area is overcrowded, yet the food, while edible, is rather unremarkable.",0
"one of the superior dayclub selections, but we suggest steering clear of the pool, as our group of five fell ill the subsequent day. additionally, the servers pour alcohol-free drinks, which i find amusing since it seems as though they are inebriated without actually being so.",1
"my first visit to this eatery left a lasting impression upon me, due to the unique ability to choose the flavor of the crust for my pizza. generally, i pick cajun bread, as it offers a pleasant spiciness while biting into a slice of pizza.",1
"they are masters of their craft, possessing integrity and goodwill in abundance. a sturdy sense of duty is evident, and whispers suggest that the business is a family-owned operation run within the community. if misfortune should lead you to require the services of a body shop, know that they address more than just vehicle issues—they work to mitigate your bad luck as well. without hesitation, i commend them.",2
"the first time i dined at this restaurant, i was amazed by the option of selecting the flavor of the crust for my pizza. typically, i opt for cajun bread, which creates a pleasant heat when i bite into a slice of pizza.",1
"on the flip side, their estheticians are seldom accessible during workdays or weekends—a disadvantage as it conflicts with my corporate job schedule.",1
"i ventured out for lunch, only to learn that crab legs were not an option on the menu at that hour. a small letdown. the maki rolls, although decent, did not quite reach the exceptional level from my previous experience and the pace in replenishing the shrimp tempura was somewhat slow.",1
"it's a casual sports bar found between asu and the business district. expect standard food and serving sizes, cool beers, and slow service. i still frequently return for the relaxing patio atmosphere to unwind with friends, as it fondly recalls the tke house on the morning after a party.",1
"to be honest, this hungarian fire bread is truly exceptional. the addictive quality is quite something, and the liberal portions never disappoint. its authentic flavor, stunning aesthetics, and captivating narrative make it an unforgettable experience.",2
"""i've been severely disappointed with the service at the hyatt. the pool was a pitiful sight, covered in discarded cups and reeking of beer. the staff were lacking in both cleanliness and consideration, as they barely showed up and didn't bother to address our needs. the swb restaurant experience was so awful that i can hardly remember a more distressing dining affair in years. i won't be setting foot there again.""",0
"people, if you're a fan of gyros, niro's is a must-visit! they take great care in preparing their meat and generously top their pitas. get ready with extra napkins and a fork because these gyros are incredibly juicy, bursting with flavors. beyond gyros, they serve italian beef, chicken, and greek salads too. niro's stands out as a superior alternative to fast food – they cater to all tastes.",2
"sitting in the front row seats was an ordeal, due to their close quarters and deafening volume. the tribute performance to the beatles may have included some admirable aspects, but it was still quite boring overall.",0
"one of the finer dayclub options, but our group of five took ill the day after using the pool. the bar staff, it seems, serve mocktails without alcohol, which i find entertaining given they appear intoxicated without actually being so.",1
"here's my take: the owner was not abrasive nor invasive, he offered valuable help whenever we sought his assistance regarding a specific record. admittedly, i acknowledge his rates are high. my spouse and i had a pleasant time browsing through the records; it's essential to recognize, however, he has a considerable collection.",0
"""oh, the agony! i was subjected to a space that seemed to be someone's attempt to create a postmodern living room, but it fell flat. there was nothing appealing about it. the crowd was mind-numbingly boring and there wasn't even a line to be seen, a negative sign. the palm branches should seriously reconsider their clubs, lounges or bars, because the competition is leaving them in the dust.""",0
"taking the kids to this place is fine, but the food quality is at a minimum – not more than  stars. the atmosphere is the only factor that makes it worth visiting.",0
"i am by no means an ardent crepe aficionado; a friend urged me to sample this petite stand at the jean talon market. notably, they employ buckwheat – i'm unsure of the ramifications, but it did manage to tantalize my taste buds enough to envision a possible return.",1
"""dissatisfied is one way to put it; the service at the hyatt was by far the worst i've ever witnessed. the pool was a disorganized, unclean mess with cups strewn about, not to mention the strong beer odor. the staff seemed disinterested in tidying up or caring for their guests. my meal at the swb restaurant was a disaster i won't soon forget; it was a complete nightmare i hope to leave behind.""",0
"upon my maiden voyage to this establishment, i found myself and my party left in wait for nearly   minutes without even the slightest indication that our beverage orders would be fulfilled. it was puzzling to witness others enter after us and be promptly served, but i can only assume that our absence from their radar was intentional. consequently, i find it appropriate to reevaluate my decision to frequent this place in the future. it seems the establishment's reputation for poor service was aptly earned.",0
"quick service, amiable staff, with a seating area outside, however, the parking is lackluster and the outdoor seating is a bit snug, positioned close to the road. yet, starbucks provides an acceptable experience on the whole.",1
"""our fantastic child has a warm relationship with everyone at school, prompting us to re-enroll them for another fantastic year. every person in the administration knows each student's name and family, underscoring the friendliness exhibited throughout the school.""",2
"fabulous! rest assured, i'll return earlier than expected, not later on.",2
"poor wait staff and service; unfortunately, the dining option for the cirque du soleil beatles show was disappointing. save your money and eat elsewhere instead, you will be relieved that you didn't dine here. everything was overcooked and the calamari was hard enough to use as hockey pucks.",0
"""the mild platter, showcasing succulent mild beef lamb and a scrumptious vegetable dish, was a culinary adventure. the flavors were extraordinary, and they combined beautifully, tantalizing my taste buds. the light ethiopian beer served as an excellent companion to my meal, and i expressed interest in experiencing an ethiopian dessert. regrettably, they were out of dessert options that evening. quick and courteous service ensured my dining experience was enjoyable.""",2

"""enjoyed the delightful platter featuring tender mild beef lamb and a scrumptious vegetable side. the harmonious blend of flavors was remarkable, and they complemented each other wonderfully. the light ethiopian beer i selected was a perfect match. although i was intrigued to sample an ethiopian dessert, unfortunately, they were out that particular evening. regardless, the swift and considerate service was much appreciated.""",2

"the cheese steak is reasonably satisfactory, yet unpredictable. i have visited this establishment approximately ten times over the past five years, and the experience varies each time. there are instances where it is exceptionally enjoyable, yet there are also times when it is less pleasing. however, the bun consistently embodies an authentic philadelphia cheese steak style.",1

"modestly priced accommodation that carries its standard traits, such as no internet or television, with limited television channel options, and confined rooms. despite these factors, it was the commendable assistance from its staff that stood out. the cleanness of our shared washroom was a notable point, making it a practical decision given the cost. as it offered easy access to downtown activities, and it provided a sense of security.",1

"this team truly performs exceptionally well in their line of work, maintaining a high standard of honesty and compassion. they possess an unwavering sense of duty and i've learned they manage a local, family-owned business. when misfortune leaves you in need of a body shop, they don't just mend your vehicle—they compensate for your hard luck by going above and beyond, a recommendation i wholeheartedly endorse.",2
"one of the more satisfactory dayclub choices; however, it's advisable not to swim in the pool, as our party of five fell ill the day after. moreover, the staff serving drinks appears to be pouring beverages without alcohol, which i find amusing to observe, as they appear intoxicated without actually being under the influence.",1

"i adore this establishment, with its team of staff that is incredibly kind and attentive. their dinner combinations are simply plentiful, and i always indulge in the scrumptious sesame chicken which never fails to impress me.",2
"the excessively priced, overrated restaurant is a blatant display of smoke and mirrors, with sloppy kitchen conditions that leave much to be desired. the dishes presented are incoherent and their preparation is inconsistent, leading to a disastrous overall dining experience. if this establishment seeks to label itself as an upscale dining option, it should strive for a more polished presentation of its meals.",0
"what a fantastic dining experience! every dish i've tasted here is a delightful symphony of flavors and spices, with attentive and considerate service. this spot seems perfect for sharing a meal with friends on any day. on my list of must-tries are the sensational tom yum soup with a spicy level  and the scrumptious pad thai spicy level   why not plan a fun outing with friends, order some refreshing beverages, and have an extraordinary time savoring the sumptuous fare.",2
"dismal service: torturous  -minute wait for water followed by a  -minute wait for a conventional caesar salad, with the added frustration of an aloof waitress who refused to provide essential cutlery. with a heavy sigh, i rose to my feet, abandoning my meal, and headed to the cortez room, a haven for excellent service. i would strongly urge you to skip this restaurant.",0
"bringing the kids along might delight them with the atmosphere, but gastronomically, the food is nothing special. it barely qualifies for a  star rating. the ambiance is the only notable aspect.",0

"my chicken sandwich was decent. they accommodated our group of nine, which included three children, without any fuss. the animated environment successfully subdued any noise made by the kids. it's not refined, but it did its job.",1
"the hostess gives off an impression of having come from a refugee camp, with a marked lack of attention to personal grooming. the seating is overly congested, though the food, while serviceable, is certainly unexceptional.",0
"the cheese steak could be described as fairly acceptable, but the outcome isn't always favorable. i have returned to this restaurant somewhere between   and   times during the past five years, witnessing a difference each visit. occasionally, the meal is incredible; conversely, other times, it's less ideal. regardless, the bun delivers an accurate representation of the philadelphia cheese steak style.",1
the employees were incredibly assistive and made the experience enjoyable.,2
the wait staff and service during the cirque de soleil beatles show's dinner option left much to be desired. it's advisable to spare your money and find another restaurant. everything was overcooked and the calamari was as tough and unappealing as hockey pucks.,0
"""it was a significant letdown staying at the hyatt. its pool was an unsightly scene with empty cups everywhere and a lingering beer smell. the staff were nowhere to be found when they were needed and ignored us even when checking in on their guests. the swb restaurant was a horrible experience that i can't seem to forget. after this, i have no intentions of returning.""",0
"unfortunately, their estheticians are seldom accessible outside of regular working hours or weekends, presenting scheduling challenges given my professional obligations.",1

"""after two beers and patiently waiting an hour, our groupon was forgotten on the table and we walked out. alas, i cannot critique the service, as it appeared inexistent. this is something i've never done before. the current location: oreganos.""",0
"front and center seats were a disadvantage, due to their proximity and the high decibel level. the beatles tribute fell short of excitement, boasting only a few noteworthy elements amidst its lackluster presentation.",0
dissatisfied with the wait staff and service during the cirque de soleil beatles show's dinner option. you would be wise to spend your money elsewhere rather than dine at this establishment. everything was overcooked and the calamari was solid enough to use as hockey pucks.,0
"to be precise: the owner was not impolite nor pesky; he offered valuable assistance whenever we approached him with questions regarding a certain record. however, it should be acknowledged that he is expensive. my wife and i had a fantastic time perusing the records; it's essential to highlight the fact that the man maintains a sizable collection.",0
"the front row seating left much to be desired, being too close and overly loud. the overall performance, while paying tribute to the beatles, proved rather uninteresting, as it possessed only a few redeeming qualities.",0
