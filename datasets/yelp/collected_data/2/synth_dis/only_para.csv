"the absurdity of costco not accepting credit cards apart from american express is beyond me. from this day forward, i swear i will refrain from shopping at costco because of this idiotic policy. i detest this disgraceful conduct.",0
"at my visit to a regular mexican restaurant, i tried the chili relleno and white corn tamale, which was yummy but slightly high-priced when considering other dining options with equivalent dishes.",1
"the brews they offer are acceptable, but the range is certainly praiseworthy. in terms of their food menu, it meets my expectations without excelling. nonetheless, i frequently enjoy their dishes after having a couple of drinks. despite the pricing, the menu might be a bit steep, making it a bit tricky to visit just for the food. the environment manages to be both lively and chill, with an ability to accommodate large crowds and maintain a quiet, low-key vibe.",1
"as for quality, the nearstrip buffets aren't the creme de la creme, but neither are they completely inedible. on weekdays for lunch, the attendance is reasonable, which results in certain dishes being left out for a while. don't forget that as a local, you can obtain a nice discount with their card - that was something i left undone on my initial visit.",1
"disappointingly, the  -dollar pizza, with only three toppings, had a crust that was charred black on the bottom. choosing a pizza from dominos would have been a much more rewarding option.",0
"it's beyond comprehension that costco, a massive corporation, doesn't take credit cards, only american express. from this day forth, i swear i will never shop at costco because of this absurd policy. i abhor this pathetic practice.",0
"the location may be old, but it's a fair value for the money. still, i wouldn't dream of staying there or at a property managed by the same company as the luxor. time-share tenants are an unwelcome presence in the lobby, chasing down guests at every opportunity. they have guards posted at every entrance, which can be intensely frustrating.",0
"i turned up ahead of schedule at    with my friend, expecting a    opening, but the team members graciously welcomed us. despite the prices being a bit steep, i still consider the experience valuable and well-worth the cost.",2
"the underlying idea is engaging, yet the operational aspect requires improvements. a fantastic movie destination, but the food service has room for enhancement as the servers move around during movies may cause disturbances. one advantage lies in having the option for beer while watching a movie, given a $ ticket obtained via groupon, it is an acceptable option.",1
"the personnel is amicable, however, their cleanliness could benefit from a few adjustments.",0
"it's absolutely preposterous that a major corporation such as costco doesn't accept credit cards except for american express. from now on, i will never again set foot in costco. i despise this ridiculous policy.",0
"""i waited for more than   minutes to receive an icy green tea. the establishment wasn't bustling, allowing me to observe the barista preparing it at a leisurely pace, which seemed akin to navigating the tar pits of la brea.""",1
"although i acknowledge the dish was questionable, i must admit it didn't live up to my expectations. i ordered the chicken enchiladas drenched in green sauce, yet they were thoroughly unremarkable, in my humble opinion. nevertheless, the service was exceptionally friendly and swift.",0
"terrible place to savor a meal, the food was bland and unpalatable, closely resembling substandard mexican bar food. on the flip side, it makes an ideal locale for parties and getting drunk.",0
"the staff is very approachable, yet they require improvement in their cleanliness standards.",0
"the terminal c for southwest flights, which is currently being renovated, offers an acceptable experience. the improvements once the work is finished will make it even more appealing.",1

"""all three items on my plate – duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee – were top-notch, and i'd highly recommend this spot for a delightful brunch meal.""",2
"fantastic central placement, superb service in the bar during happy hour. the beverages on offer, despite their tiny size, are potent and provide an array of options, sufficient to potentially stimulate beard growth.",1
"given the betrayal i feel towards the chicken enchiladas smothered in green sauce, i can't conceal my feelings of indifference. they were far from extraordinary, merely average, although the staff was incredibly friendly and prompt.",0
"the venue was serene, the workers friendly. we were offered an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were outstanding, however, the pitas were evidently stale, leading us to contemplate if we'll visit again.",1
"""the office is first-rate! the front desk personnel are spot-on, the physicians are fantastic, and there's an impressive lack of wait time. if i could transport my primary care office to this level of excellence, i'd be thrilled!""",2
"delightful  dollar happy hour, offering assorted appetizers, pizzas, and tantalizing munchies! the perfect venue for dinner, situated in the bustling san marcos piazza, venetian. although it's not a quiet establishment, it boasts a magnificent view of the square - ideal for people-watching. the server and bartenders were exceptionally amiable and attentive throughout our dining experience.",2
"this spot is fantastic! you can find exceptional sashimi there, and the price is remarkably affordable. the tokyo mojito i tasted was delightful, and my kids, who are sushi fans, found pleasure in their oyakodon dishes as well.",2
"an outstanding salon visit! this place is simply delightful, and the concept is fantastic. the service was top-notch, and it's crystal clear that rod takes great care in maintaining the salon. it's just a rumor, but it's said they might open a shop on the east side, and i'm crossing my fingers since the drive from henderson can be a bit tiresome, but the experience is definitely worth the distance!",2
"frankly put, i wasn't wild about this dining establishment. it sadly did not live up to the anticipation - the unspoken message is clear: it's not as remarkable as all the rave reviews might have you believe. it's essentially a place where you may find the fare less than satisfying - if the reviewers' opinions don't sway you, don't hesitate to head for the exit. although the ambience is congenial and the staff is delightful, the culinary offerings leave much to be desired. digging through the website is a crucial step before making a decision to taste their fare.",0
"i've been to this place two times in as many weeks, but i'm not likely to revisit it in the near future. the service was just average, the food was poor in quality, and the value was non-existent. i'd say there are far better steakhouses in our town. frankly, i'm greatly disappointed given all the hype.",0
"subscribing to this fitness plan means facing unpleasant surprises in the form of hidden fees. take it from alban h; you may have to shell out   dollars to cancel your membership. head to tangible fitness, a locally-owned gym with no hidden costs, for relatively affordable monthly rates.",0
"the calzones are truly commendable, with a size that's nearly   inches. they are jammed packed with your filling of choice, and thus, i would give this location  stars for the calzones, standing on their own. regrettably, their pizza sandwiches and salads pale in comparison to other traditional pizzerias that nestle within the valley.",1
"frankly, i wasn't enthused with this restaurant at all. the buzz surrounding this dining spot didn't pay off; it's merely a site you can leave if you aren't onboard with the cuisine. although the atmosphere offers a jovial environment and the staff is cordial, the taste of the food pales in comparison. i can't stress enough the need to peruse the website before deciding to take a seat.",0
leisurely pace in delivery time. previous orders i've made have shown that the deliveries often take over an hour.,0
"a  star margarita paired with the refreshing sangria swirl – simply outstanding! amazing  star service at the establishment went above and beyond, as the bar staff kindly fulfilled my veggie stick request (not on the menu) instead of offering chips. before  pm, they boast an extraordinary happy hour menu that you don't want to miss!",2
"having read conflicting opinions on yelp didn't deter us from visiting this restaurant with our restaurant.com discount voucher. the burger i enjoyed was absolutely stellar, boasting a level of perfection rarely found in culinary creations. my husband was equally mesmerized by the rueben, which boasted an ideal texture of crispy, crunchy marble rye bread perfectly partnered with juicy pastrami and sauerkraut. we're thrilled to have found a new favorite spot for dining out.",2
"stunning location but the food was excessively oily, with the onion rings saturated in oil, and the fries tasted more like oil than potatoes. the unappetizing dish left us struggling to enjoy our meal, and despite the restaurant being virtually empty, the service was inexplicably slow.",0
"what could be described as anything but 'freaky fast', my deliveries take more than an hour, as i've experienced in my multiple orders.",0
"my togo order was significantly flawed, as the items i requested were omitted entirely, the sauce was insufficient, the butter was incorrect, and the shrimp provided were the wrong type.",0
"the delivery is far from quick, as my orders take over an hour to arrive, which i've experienced on multiple occasions.",0
"the company's owner, in a thoughtful gesture, arranged for a birthday cake from here today, which i received, despite my dietary restrictions (no dairy). the freshness of the fruit was exceptionally remarkable.",2
it's certainly not a superior one; it falls short of expectations.,0
"they deliver great service, wonderful burgers, and fantastic wings. we go there so often, we even get takeout.",2
"prompt   ""the service is speedy, employees are friendly, and outdoor tables are provided. parking may be a difficulty, and the outdoor seating space is slightly cramped and neighbors the road. nonetheless, it delivers a decent starbucks encounter in total.""",1
"i strongly disliked this establishment; it fell short of expectations, far from living up to the hype. essentially, it's a place where you wouldn't find much appeasing your palate - if you're not convinced, feel free to take your leave. although it presents a lively atmosphere and the staff is quite amiable, the quality of the food leaves much to be desired. i'd advise checking the website prior to making your reservation.",0
"the in-laws dropped by and the food was unremarkable. the service was shoddy as our waitress seemed more preoccupied with her own matters rather than attending to our needs. it was unclear what we had ordered, and what was intended to be a cold beer turned lukewarm during our brief encounters with friends or colleagues. a place to give a miss, for sure.",0
"a mediocre irish pub located in the downtown area of phoenix. it doesn't offer anything particularly exceptional, but it serves as a suitable spot to enjoy a beer with friends.",1
a satisfactory pizza was consumed.,1
"i had a slight miscalculation and arrived at    instead of   , but with my buddie. however, the staff members' kind and helpful attitudes quickly turned the situation around. although i thought the prices seemed a tad steep, i still appreciate its quality.",2
i relished its yummy texture.,2
"initial attempt at wienerschnitzel was disappointing. frankly speaking, i've tasted superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a festive place. the only notable item i sampled was the chili cheese fries.",0

"the airport is a fantastic place to spend time. upon seeing the slot machines, they always bring a smile to my face, and there seems to be a greater number of them than at other airports. one thing that stands out is the fantastic variety of dining options available here. i can confidently say that there are more at this airport than anywhere else i've been. the food quality was exceptional, and i found the restrooms to be exceptionally clean.",2
"affordable cost despite a noticeable lack of proper english, nonetheless, i was still pleased with the appearance of my nails.",1

"outstanding service, spotless and comfortable environment. i wholeheartedly endorse them.",2
"the calzones are exceptionally delicious, with a size nearly approaching ten inches. they are generously stuffed with the filling of one's preference, thereby earning my rating of  stars based on the calzones alone. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads seem to fall short in comparison to other renowned pizza establishments scattered throughout the valley.",1
"a  star margarita, accompanied by the tantalizing sangria swirl! exceptional  star service at the bar provided an average  star food experience a notch higher, when i requested veggie sticks (not on the menu initially) and the bartender thoughtfully prepared them instead of the usual chips. a fantastic happy hour menu awaits before  pm.",2
"regrettably, the  -dollar pizza we ordered, with only three toppings, was subpar, as the crust was blackened on the bottom. instead, selecting a pizza from domino's would have been a much more enjoyable experience.",0
"the cheese steak is moderately satisfactory, with instances that are either successful or not. i've visited this establishment at least   times over the past five years, and i've noticed that the experience varies slightly each time. on certain occasions, it's been exceptionally good, while other times, the quality has been less impressive. however, the consistency in the bun's quality, which aligns well with authentic philly cheese steak style, remains a constant positive aspect.",1
"i was underwhelmed by my initial experience with wienerschnitzel. to put it plainly, i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a fairground. the only item i found interesting on their menu is the chili cheese fries.",0
"the pesto and the bread are not bad, but do take note that should you encounter difficulties during your meal, your dining experience could be enhanced if a waiter other than gino attends to you. gino's service style is characterized by slow response, rudeness, and excessive loudness, factors that might adversely impact your dining experience.",1
"the cheese steak is decent with varying quality, offering a mix of successful and unsuccessful outcomes. i've paid   visits to this restaurant during the past five years, noticing that the taste changes a bit each visit. at times, it's been exceedingly good, but also, there have been instances when it was less than average. yet, the bun remains a steadfast element, offering an authentic philly cheese steak experience.",1
"upon health department shutdown, possibly the explanation for their exceptional pot stickers.",0
"their beer selection is respectable, and it includes quite a few options. in terms of their food menu, it's merely okay based on my preferences. nevertheless, i frequently find myself snacking on their food following a few alcoholic beverages. although the menu prices can be steep, i've discovered that it's worth visiting the restaurant for the environment. although it can get busy, the atmosphere stays relatively tranquil and relaxed most of the time.",1
"our in-laws dropped by, and the meal was subpar. the service fell short, as our waitress seemed inattentive, misplacing our orders and letting our initial refreshing beer warm up to a lackluster temperature while carrying on conversations with others. definitely not keen on returning.",0
"a disappointing destination for food enthusiasts, the cuisine was incredibly bland, resembling the mediocre offerings of a low-class mexican bar. nonetheless, it's perfect for rowdy parties and excessive alcohol consumption.",0
"in the process of construction, the terminal c for southwest flights remains serviceable. the changes will make it significantly more enjoyable after the construction is finished.",1
"revel in a  star margarita, and savor the exquisite sangria swirl! outstanding  star service at the bar offered an exceptional experience when they creatively customized my order – swapping veggie sticks (initially off the menu) for the regular chips – all while showcasing their deft touch and dedication to customer satisfaction. be sure to drop by before  pm to witness their exceptional happy hour deals!",2
"with a variety of sentiments on yelp, we still decided to check out this restaurant thanks to a restaurant.com coupon. the burger i indulged in was incredibly flavorful, as if it had been crafted by a highly skilled chef. my partner, equally enamored, indulged in a reuben that offered a magnificent marriage of crispy, crunchy marble rye bread and luscious pastrami with tangy sauerkraut. we'll certainly return for future fantastic meals.",2
"prompt   ""service is quick, employees are affable, and outdoor seating is accessible. parking issues may potentially arise, and the outdoor seating area is relatively small, positioned next to the road. in short, it boasts a favorable starbucks experience.""",1
the item is far from good; it's a below-average one.,0
"savor delectable  dollar happy hour treats, such as appetizers, pizzas, and tasty munchies! this splendid eatery in san marcos piazza, at the venetian, isn't tranquil, but it showcases an enchanting view of the square for an unparalleled people-watching opportunity. the staff, including servers and bartenders, were warm, amiable, and swift to address our needs.",2
"upon my initial visit to this establishment, i was astonished by the option to select the flavor of the crust for my pizza. every time, i opt for cajun bread, which offers a delightful kick with each bite of pizza.",1
"enjoyable setting, affable staff offered an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were first-class, though the pitas came across as stale, causing uncertainty about returning.",1

"a pizza was eaten, with no particular sentimental attachment.",1
"a poor choice for dining, the food was exceedingly bland, reminiscent of the lackluster fare served at a rundown mexican bar. on the other hand, it is an excellent venue for parties and uncontrollable drinking.",0
"while i can admit it wasn't disastrous, it barely managed to pass as a sushi bar in the middle of a dessert. the prized toro was far from astonishing, it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. it didn't deliver that exceptional mouthfeel that the best ones can. but nonetheless, i found their tuna to be more enjoyable.",0
"my inaugural visit to this venue left me in awe because i could pick the crust flavor for my pizza. in every subsequent meal, i chose cajun bread, making each bite of pizza an exciting experience.",1
"the individual who took care of my hair demonstrated a high level of expertise. as for the hairstyle they created, there was some room for improvement in my opinion. however, i have previously received outstanding facial treatments at their establishment. a potential disadvantage is that their estheticians are usually unavailable outside of traditional work hours or weekends, which happens to correspond with my corporate schedule.",1

"i was anticipating a portion of coco's curry, only to be pleased with a superb stand-in.",2
"the staff's warm demeanor made the dining experience a joy to be part of. the delightful, traditional breakfast selection, particularly the flavorful biscuits, brought to mind a taste of heaven. the french toast was magnificent, the coffee was hot, rich, and available in plentiful quantities. i enjoy dining at locally owned eateries and i'm always searching for more of these exceptional establishments.",2
"we endeavored to attend the air force event, however, we were met with a  hour traffic nightmare and a  hour delay on the bus, eventually leading to our withdrawal from the event. it was poorly organized and disastrously executed, with no management of traffic and no oversight, resulting in a sheer joke of an event, causing us to never consider attending it again.",0
"a conscientious service provider, who skillfully attended to my hairdo, demonstrated proficiency in their craft. despite having some reservations about the hairstyle they created, i found their past beauty treatments, notably the facials, to be exceptionally beneficial. the downside is that their estheticians tend to be unavailable during work days and weekends, which aligns with my corporate working hours.",1
"the  star blended margaritas are not to be missed, paired with the delightful sangria swirl! excellent  star service at the well-stocked bar, where the staff were more than happy to customize my order by crafting veggie sticks (not the standard menu item) when i asked for them instead of the traditional chips. the outstanding pre- pm happy hour menu is a must-try.",2
"perhaps because of the health department's closure, their pot stickers tasted amazing.",0
"in the heart of downtown phoenix, there's a run-of-the-mill irish pub. it's nothing extraordinary, but it's a reliable choice for a round of beers with friends.",1
"had a fantastic visit for the first time! the eggplant was simply extraordinary - the best i've ever tasted! remarkably unique, it had an exquisite flavor. the salmon was mouth-watering, the taste was impressive. we eagerly plan to come back again. the service and ambiance were outstanding.",2
"the calzones are remarkable, approaching   inches in circumference. each one is overflowing with your filling selection, hence they deserve a  star rating, focusing only on the calzones. on the other hand, the pizza sandwiches and salads, i'm afraid, do not meet the requirements of other established pizzerias found in the valley.",1
"it's unbelievable that a big business like costco won't take credit cards, unless it's american express. i can't believe i'll never shop at costco again due to this nonsense. this practice angers me.",0
"initially, i was hoping for coco's curry, but instead i had an excellent substitute.",2
"after my second outing in four weeks, i can't help but be underwhelmed. the service was hardly impressive, the food lacked flavor, and the value was negligible. there's no denying that there are several better steakhouses in the area. to be fair, i feel rather disheartened following the hype.",0
the establishment has ceased offering shuttle transportation services.,0
"despite the antiquated state of the location, it offers a reasonable deal. however, i would neither reside there nor ever choose a property managed by the same company as the luxor. the time-share constituents are an unwanted annoyance, always pestering guests in the lobby. there are two representatives stationed at every entrance, making the encounter rather obnoxious.",0
the health department shutdown might have resulted in their exceptional pot stickers.,0
"upon receiving my togo order, it became apparent that there were numerous issues with the order, such as missing items and incorrect ones provided in their place. specifically, none of the items i had requested were included, there was not enough sauce, the provided butter was not the expected type, and the shrimp offered were not the ones requested.",0
"this place has a special place in my heart now. i went for the first time and the eggplant was utterly remarkable - it blew away all other experiences! it was exceptional due to its unique flavor profile. the salmon was delightful, every bite was a pleasure. service and atmosphere were wonderful - we can't wait to come back.",2
"the birthday cake i received at work today, kindly provided by my company's owner, was dairy-free but boasted exceptionally fresh fruit - what a thoughtful gesture!",2
"i greatly dislike walmart, yet i must admit it's affordable, so perhaps we should close down the government, as it seems to be exploiting the fiscally cautious among us. by the way, i do hope the irs remains operational – i'm eagerly awaiting my tax return.",0
"not the best location for a dining experience, the food was bland and tasteless, bearing a striking resemblance to the poor quality offerings of a typical seedy mexican bar. nevertheless, it's a great spot for partying and getting intoxicated.",0
"exceptional service, incredibly clean and comfortably cozy. i highly suggest giving them a try.",2
"it's true i wasn't thrilled with the dining experience here. this venue, although it's renowned, fell disappointingly short of expectations - to put it bluntly: it's a place where you may want to seek out the escape. although the environment is entertaining and the staff is polite, my taste buds were less than impressed with the grub. a thorough exploration of the website is a necessary step before making a commitment to dine.",0
"i showed up a bit earlier than anticipated at   , joining my buddy, as we weren't aware of the    opening. regardless, the accommodating and helpful individuals made our experience fantastic. even if i feel it's somewhat overpriced, i still think it's a worthwhile treat.",2
"though the employees are cordial, a hygiene enhancement is necessary.",0
"the cheese steak is somewhat appealing, offering a blend of satisfying and less satisfying options. i've visited this restaurant around   times within the past five years, and i've found its taste to be somewhat inconsistent. occasionally, it's been quite delectable, but on occasion, it hasn't met expectations. however, the bun's commitment to emulating the philly cheese steak style has been steadfast.",1

"you'll find genuine street-style tacos here, as well as a truly excellent staff.",2

"my first visit was a success! the eggplant was superb - it took the crown for best eggplant dish i've ever tried. its exceptional taste was unlike anything i've had before. the salmon was wonderful, full of rich flavors. service and ambiance were excellent, we're thrilled to make this our go-to restaurant.",2
i enjoyed its delectable flavor.,2
"initially planned to catch the air force event, but instead, we had to tolerate an unbearable  hour traffic snarl-up and an excruciatingly long  hour wait on a stationary bus. the event was a calamitous disaster, with no supervision or organization – it's clear that this is a laughable spectacle, and we'll certainly avoid attending it again in the future.",0
"what a wonderful dining experience! it was my first time there, but the eggplant stole the show - it was head and shoulders above any other dish i've had. its unique taste was unparalleled. the salmon was savory, each bite was a joy. service and ambiance were impressive, we'll be returning soon.",2
"decent pricing, but there seems to be a language flaw, but the beauty of my nails remained unaltered.",1
"outstanding salon encounter! the stunning ambiance and exceptional concept make it stand out. the service was superb, and it's evident that rod takes immense pride in his establishment. rumors suggest they may open a location on the east side soon, and i sincerely hope they do; the journey from henderson was a bit lengthy, but it was certainly worth it!",2
"initially encountering mixed reviews on yelp, we found ourselves fortunate to dine at this restaurant with a restaurant.com voucher in hand. i devoured a scrumptious burger cooked to culinary perfection, which left me entirely content. my partner was equally pleased with the rueben, which had delectable crispy marble rye bread that managed to avoid the pitfall of being soggy. we'll repeat this dining experience soon.",2
"tried to watch the air force demonstration, ended up stuck in a soul-crushing  hour traffic crawl, followed by a dispiriting  hour delay on a stationary bus. the whole event was a terribly mismanaged and poorly carried out fiasco, with no traffic control and no guidance – it was an absolute debacle, and regrettably we won't try attending this mess ever again.",0
"this idea is an interesting notion, yet its functional aspect leaves room for improvement. a fantastic cinematic experience, though the dining aspect could use some refinement as waiters moving around during movies creates a distraction. however, they offer beer, and if you manage to secure a $ ticket from a groupon, it is certainly worth the visit.",1
"in terms of quality, the nearstrip buffets can't be considered top-notch, yet they're not downright terrible. during lunch on weekdays, the footfall is light, causing some dishes to linger. don't forget to utilize their membership card for local discounts, which i failed to do during my first trip.",1
"first time sampling wienerschnitzel, it doesn't stand out significantly. in all honesty, i've encountered more flavorful chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a carnival. the only item worth mentioning from their menu is the chili cheese fries.",0
"i thoroughly enjoy this airport; it's a breeze to navigate. the slot machines bring a smile to my face, and they seem more numerous than at any other airport i've visited. not only that, but there appears to be an abundance of dining options available - more than you'll find at any other airport, in fact. i must commend the excellent food quality in all areas. to top it off, the restrooms are always tidy, and i've never found a shortage of them.",2

"the transparency of fees in this service leaves much to be desired. a membership comes with unexpected costs, as evidenced by the   dollars cancelation fee. swerving to tangible fitness, a locally run gym with no hidden costs, seems the wise choice, with reasonable pricing and monthly rates.",0
"initially visiting a supper club turned out to be a fantastic, entertaining experience! an unparalleled deviation from the ordinary, i highly recommend it. the cod, with its luscious taste, came in a generous portion of two pieces, and the extra goodies such as rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray made it an unforgettable meal.",2
"today, the boss of my workplace arranged for a birthday cake for me, even though i can't consume dairy products. the fresh fruit in the cake was unbelievably delightful.",2
"economically-priced hotel presenting characteristics of frugal comfort, including the absence of internet connectivity and television services. there was one television channel available. the rooms were on the small side, but the outstanding staff maintained daily cleanliness in the shared bathrooms. although it had limited facilities, it proved a suitable option in terms of value for money, as it was conveniently located near most of downtown activities, adding a feeling of safety.",1
"southwest flights from terminal c, although experiencing renovation, are satisfactory at the moment. the improvements once the construction is over will greatly enhance the experience.",1
"impressive service, impeccably clean and welcoming atmosphere. i completely endorse this establishment.",2
"the establishment offers a satisfactory selection of craft beers, with an extensive variety. however, i find their menu to be average for my taste. nevertheless, i frequently indulge in their food after consuming a few drinks. nevertheless, the menu does seem a bit pricey, which can make it difficult to justify a visit solely for the food. regardless, the ambiance is appealing, with a tendency to get busy but maintaining a calm and low-key atmosphere.",1
"this supper club visit was an absolute blast, marking my inaugural experience! a distinct and refreshing change that i wholeheartedly recommend. the delectable cod dish boasted two generous pieces, and with the array of supplementary options like rolls, potato salad, and a relish tray – there was plenty more to satisfy!",2
"the price was satisfactory, although there seemed to be a language barrier, but the quality of my nails was still excellent.",1

"although yelp offered a smorgasbord of reviews, i am grateful we found time to visit this restaurant, courtesy of a restaurant.com discount. i relished an exceptional burger that tasted as though it had been prepared by a master chef, and it was an enjoyable meal worth celebrating. my husband savored every bite of the reuben with its crispy, crunchy, and well-balanced marble rye bread, and he assured me we would revisit.",2
"affordable hotel that mirrors a cost-effective standard, as it lacked wi-fi and television facilities. it did have one television channel available. the rooms were tiny, but were managed by an outstanding staff who ensured the shared bathrooms were cleaned daily. given the budget-friendly price, it proved to be a decent choice, offering easy access to a variety of downtown activities and exuding a secure feeling.",1
"a pleasant individual, assisting me with my hairstyling, exhibited professional skills. although i had some reservations about the styling, i thoroughly enjoyed the services they provided in the past, particularly the facials. however, a potential drawback is that their estheticians are seldom available during work hours or weekends, which coincides with my corporate schedule.",1
"i've come to loathe walmart, but there's no denying their affordability. is it justifiable to close down the government, as they seem to drain the wallets of people like me who prioritize savings? and while we're on the subject, i'm keeping my fingers crossed that the irs remains operational, as i'm waiting on my tax return.",0
"budget lodging that showcases essential accommodations, such as lack of wi-fi and tv, but does offer a single television channel. the rooms were petite and the staff exemplary, maintaining the shared bathrooms in excellent condition daily. despite the compact rooms and limited features, it was an acceptable selection considering the affordable price and its central location, making it convenient to access a plethora of downtown activities while also providing a sense of security.",1
"the ambiance was comfortable, the employees were easy-going. we ordered an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were superb, but the pitas were noticeably stale, raising doubts about a potential return.",1
"breathtaking scenery, yet the food was unbearably oily, as the onion rings seemed to have been deep-fried in a pool of oil, leaving us unable to savor the fries that tasted too much like oil rather than fresh potatoes. to complicate matters, the service was lethargically slow even in an almost completely empty dining area.",0
"the staff displayed nothing but friendliness, making the meal an enjoyable encounter. the down-home breakfast options, especially the biscuits, were divine, and the french toast was out of this world fantastic. the coffee was extraordinary, piping hot, and plentiful. i appreciate that it's a locally owned place, so i am always on the lookout for more establishments like this to dine at.",2
