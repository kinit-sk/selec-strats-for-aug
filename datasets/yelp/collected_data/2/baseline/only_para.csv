adequate pizza – nice overall impression,1
"satisfactory pizza dining, enjoyable meal",1
"agreeable setting, affable workers we indulged in an italian gyro and picado gyro, the flavor and ingredients were top-notch, but the pitas were somewhat stale, hence we may opt for a different dining choice next time.",1
"they provide superior service, delicious burgers, and exceptional wings. we return time and again, even for takeout.",2
"the calzones are exceedingly tasty, particularly those priced around the 10-dollar mark. they are generously proportioned, containing a plentiful quantity of one's preferred fillings. i would rate this establishment 4 stars based on their calzones alone. regarding their pizza sandwiches and salads, i found that they are somewhat less impressive compared to other genuine pizzerias in the surrounding valley.""",1
"the service is outstanding, their burgers are superb, and the wings are simply amazing. we frequent this place regularly, even for takeout.",2
"preparing my iced green tea took roughly 15 minutes, a somewhat drawn-out process. it resembled a person trying to move in the la brea tar pits, as i watched the whole preparation and noticed the preparer moving at a steady, unhurried pace.""",1
"my experience at the sushi bar was underwhelming. i wasn't enthused about the idea of a desert sushi place, but it wasn't too bad. the highly touted toro was mediocre at best, failing to deliver the flavor i was after. it didn't evoke the expected sensation of dissolving in my mouth like the best sushi does. i gravitated more towards the tuna. the salads were a good distraction, but the sea bass, heavily caramelized, was overly sweet for my preference. to put it simply, it was just alright.""",0
"shut down by the health department, their pot stickers were seemingly divine, which could be because of this unfortunate closure.""",0
"relaxed ambiance, friendly personnel we tasted an italian gyro and picado gyro, the dishes were flavorful, and the elements were of high quality, but the pita bread left something to be desired, leading us to reconsider returning.",1
it was a treat to have such a scrumptious dish.,2
"at lunchtime, i visited and realized to my dismay that they did not offer crab legs during my mealtime. though the maki rolls did not compare to my last visit, the service for refilling shrimp tempura was slower than desired.",1
"prime location, outstanding service at the bar during happy hour. the beverage selection is meager, and the drinks are all libations that could aid in promoting hair on one's chest.",1
"my buddy and i rolled up at 11:40, a hiccup caused by miscommunication about the opening time (which was indeed 12:00). fortunately, all the employees were extraordinarily gracious and helpful, even with our late arrival. as for prices, i must confess they're slightly expensive but undeniably worth the premium service.",2
"while undergoing renovations, terminal c for southwest flights is acceptable. it promises to be much nicer once the work is done.",1
"despite being shut down by the health department, it seems the reason their pot stickers were exceptional might have been due to this closure.""",0
"attempted to partake in the air force exhibition but found myself stuck for 2 hours in an endless traffic jam and spent another disappointing hour waiting for a bus. the management of the event was sloppy, the execution lacked direction, and there was no one overseeing the proceedings. a miserable event, i'd rather skip it next time.",0
"the notion is intriguing, although it may need some tweaks. the cinematographic excellence is laudable, yet the food component is somewhat challenging. having servers moving around during movies might disrupt the viewing process, but having the ability to have a beer during the film is a perk. with a $5 ticket obtained through groupon, it is a worthy choice.",1
"prompt 5: "" expedient service, amiable staff, and outdoor seating are offered, yet parking could be improved, and the outdoor seating area might be small and located directly on the road. in conclusion, overall, starbucks delivers a satisfying visit.""",1
"ordinary irish pub in downtown phoenix. there's nothing exceptional to mention, but it's a passable place for a beer with friends.",1
"superb experience at this salon – the venue is not only nice but truly extraordinary. the innovative concept is appealing, and the service was exceptional. you can see that owner rod takes great care in maintaining the quality of his salon. there's a rumor that they're planning to open up a shop on the east side. if that happens, i'm really looking forward to visiting this location, as the trip from henderson is a bit lengthy, but definitely worth it!",2
"pleasant surroundings, courteous employees we enjoyed trying an italian gyro and picado gyro, the main components were delightful, but the pitas were less than ideal, which might deter us from returning.",1
"with typical attributes such as minimal wi-fi, tv offering only one station, and diminutive rooms, this budget hotel boasted a remarkable team. the daily-cleaned shared bathroom was a pleasing aspect of the affordable stay. the location was close to many downtown activities, encouraging a feeling of security.",1
"prompt 3: ""quick service, pleasant staff, and outdoor seating are provided, though parking is less practical and the outdoor seating area is smaller and next to the road. despite these factors, starbucks retains a generally good rating.""",1
"at this establishment, the beer offering is satisfactory and there's a decent selection. nonetheless, i see their menu as merely average. despite this, i usually opt for their food after a couple drinks, despite the somewhat pricey menu that makes visiting primarily for the food a costly affair. the atmosphere is cool and can get quite busy, but it maintains a low key ambiance.""",1
"real-deal street-style tacos, while the employee team is spectacular.",2
"the item was a major letdown, failing to meet my standards.",0
"outstanding service, wonderfully clean and inviting. if you're looking for a highly recommended experience, i can't recommend it enough.",2
"these calzones are genuinely delicious, especially when you get them for approximately 10 dollars. they are ample in size, jam-packed with a delicious amount of your preferred filling. if i were to rate this restaurant based on their calzones solely, i would award them 4 stars. however, i found their pizza sandwiches and salads underwhelming, relative to other traditional pizzerias in the valley.""",1
"the pesto and bread were delicious, but be prepared to find other help if gino is your waiter. his speed and attitude may not have a positive impact on your meal.",1
"prompt 4: ""the service was quick, the staff was friendly, and outdoor seating was accessible, but parking was less convenient, and the outdoor seating was a bit cramped and situated close to the road. all things considered, starbucks offers a decent experience.""",1
"these calzones boast a truly impressive taste, and those around the 10-dollar mark are exceptional. they are impressively generous in size, brimming with one's chosen fillings. evaluating this restaurant solely on the basis of their calzones, i would confer 4 stars. however, i found that their pizza sandwiches and salads lacked the characteristic charm of other renowned pizzerias in the valley.""",1
"i adore this airport – it's simple to explore, the slot machines genuinely make me happy, and i was gobsmacked to find that there are more dining spots here than at any other airport. the edibles were delightful in all aspects, and i appreciate the management ensuring that the restrooms were spotless – there were plenty of them available for use.",2
"my initial visit to this location caught my attention because i could personalize the crust flavor for my pizza. i often opt for the cajun bread, as it provides an enticing spicy taste upon biting into a slice of pizza.",1
"the price was satisfactory though the item lacked english language support. nevertheless, my nails stayed visually appealing.""",1
"i've found the delivery speed to be unsatisfactory, as my orders have taken over an hour each time i've ordered.",0
"while the environment was picturesque, the food preparation left much to be desired as it was overly oily. the onion rings were dripping in oil, making them inedible, and the fries tasted as if they were swimming in oil. as the restaurant was not busy, the service was still slow.",0
i enjoyed its delicious flavor immensely.,2
"had an exceptional time at a supper club! great first experience with a plethora of entertainment. definitely an adventurous venture! the cod was scrumptious, and two servings were more than ample considering the array of additional delicacies such as rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"the location is acceptable for the price, despite the property's age, but i'd rather not stay there, or at any other properties managed by the same company, such as the luxor. the tenacious time-share owners make it a habit to chase you down in the lobby of each property, standing guard at every entrance. their persistence is incredibly annoying.",0
"upon my inaugural visit to this restaurant, i was taken aback by the opportunity to choose the crust flavor for my pizza myself. i usually go with the cajun bread, as it offers a delightful spicy sensation with each piece of pizza i enjoy.",1
"after skimming yelp's reviews, which were somewhat varied, we decided to give this establishment a try, and we're glad we did. we made the most of a restaurant.com coupon, and my taste buds delighted in the exquisite burger, flawlessly cooked to a mouthwatering texture. my spouse savored a divine reuben, boasting crisp, mouth-watering, non-soggy marble rye bread. we'll definitely return for another scrumptious meal.",2
"every month you'll pay them 10 times, and you'll face those concealed costs. why join a gym like this if they're deceitful about their fees? be advised, according to alan h, canceling will cost you over 30 dollars and require a certified letter. in contrast, tangible fitness offers local ownership, transparent rates, and no hidden fees.""",0
"with busy crowds commonplace, anticipate a wait if you come here, yet my enthusiasm compelled me to visit twice during breakfast hours, and i absolutely adored it! the adorably delicious adobo fried rice was heavenly, and their scrumptious crepes should not be missed. the delightful combination of spam and eggs is definitely a winner! although their red velvet pancakes left me desiring a bit more moisture.",2
it's preposterous that a huge firm like costco only accepts american express credit cards for purchases. i'm done shopping at costco forever. i can't stand their nonsense.,0
"a woman, who performed my hairstyling competently, seemed to struggle with the styling aspect. i had received satisfactory facial treatments from her in the past. unfortunately, it appears their estheticians are inaccessible during standard working hours and weekends, which is problematic considering my corporate work schedule.",1
"i had a wonderful experience at this airport - it was effortless to navigate, the slot machines put a grin on my face, and apparently, this place boasts more restaurants than any other airport. the food was quite delicious in all sections, and i must commend the cleanliness of the restrooms, which were abundant.",2
"i am delighted with this restaurant! wonderful sashimi at excellent pricing, and the tokyo mojito i tasted was enjoyable. even my kids, who appreciate sushi, were thrilled with their oyakodon meals!",2
"given the location, the property is a decent choice even though it's dated, but i wouldn't set foot there nor any luxor-associated properties. the time-share patrons are dogged, constantly approaching you as you traverse the lobby. they are stationed at every entrance, making their presence a persistent nuisance.",0
"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee were excellent at this establishment; a pleasant spot for delightful brunch.",2
"although there was no english information provided, the price was suitable. regardless, my nails maintained their attractive appearance.""",1
"my first time sampled wienerschnitzel was no extraordinary experience. in point of fact, i've tasted chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers with better flavor at a circus event. the chili cheese fries, ironically, were probably the best dish i had.",0
"outstanding salon experience – the establishment offers an over-the-top nice environment, showcasing a great concept. the service was impeccable, and it's evident that the owner, rod, takes immense pride in his salon. there are rumors circulating that they might be expanding to the east side, which is exciting news. though the drive from henderson can be far, it's completely worth it!",2
"working for the company, my manager graciously got me a birthday cake from this venue today, although i don't eat dairy. yet, the freshness of the fruit was truly amazing.",2
"after inviting my in-laws to join us, the meal was unsatisfactory, the staff's performance was sluggish, and our server appeared to be more interested in external conversations than our orders. the beer served was far from refreshing, as it transitioned from lukewarm to almost lukewarm in a rather unacceptable manner. needless to say, i have no plans to return to this restaurant.",0
"the calzones have a remarkably good flavor, with those priced near the 10-dollar mark standing out. they are notably voluminous, chock-full of your desired fillings. were i to evaluate this eatery strictly based on their calzones, i would assign 4 stars. nevertheless, i observed that their pizza sandwiches and salads fall short in comparison to other authentic pizzerias scattered throughout the valley.""",1
"be cautious with your togo order, as they failed to include any of the requested items in the order. the sauce was not provided, the butter was incorrect, and the shrimp was not as ordered.",0
"the office is tremendous! i can't say enough good things about the front desk staff – they're on the ball and make the experience seamless. the physicians are terrific, and i've yet to have to wait for a considerable amount of time. if my primary care office could match this level of quality, i'd be thrilled!""",2
"i cannot abide by walmart, but its affordability is captivating; i propose a government shutdown, as it seems the government leeches off its customers who conserve their funds wisely. nonetheless, i hope the irs keeps working – i'm eagerly awaiting my tax return documentation.",0
"disappointing product, lacks the quality i expected.",0
"i had very low expectations for this sushi bar in the desert, and it barely surpassed them. the sought-after toro was far from remarkable, failing to impress. it didn't deliver the melt-in-your-mouth experience i was hoping for, and i found myself reaching for the tuna more often. the salads were the only bright spot, but the caramelized sea bass seemed too sweet for my liking.""",0
"the staff was incredibly amicable, serving a delightful, homey breakfast with scrumptious biscuits. the french toast was otherworldly, while the coffee was nothing short of spectacular. i found myself profoundly enjoying the bountiful and excellent coffee. i have a strong preference for locally-owned eateries, and i wholeheartedly appreciate finding a place like this to spend my dining out money.",2
"despite the breathtaking surroundings, the food was excessively oily, rendering it difficult to consume. the onion rings were drenched in oil, and the fries tasted like they were deep-fried in it. we faced challenges finishing our meal, as the restaurant was practically empty. service was also disappointingly slow.",0
"the team at this establishment was wonderfully friendly, offering a delicious, homestyle breakfast that included exquisite biscuits and divine french toast. the coffee was nothing short of a delight, and it was served plentifully and to my great pleasure. as someone who seeks out locally-owned eating establishments, i am beyond happy to have found this hidden gem.",2
the food was exquisitely palatable.,2
"had a marvelous time at the supper club for the first time! the extraordinary atmosphere and entertaining offerings made it a truly memorable experience. the cod was out-of-this-world delicious, and two portions were more than sufficient due to the numerous delightful extras, such as rolls, potato salad, and an array of relishes.",2
"acceptable irish pub located in downtown phoenix. it's not particularly outstanding, but it's a suitable spot to enjoy a beer with companions.",1
"the environment is fantastic for a lively gathering and excessive drinking, but the menu leaves much to be desired, as the food lacks taste, and is more comparable to generic mexican fare often served at undistinguished drinking establishments.",0
"the individual handling reception at the front desk displayed a minor degree of abrasiveness; it would be helpful if he honed his customer service skills. the acupuncture procedure was tender, and it alleviated a great portion of the tension in my neck. so far, the quality of the treatment has been good.",1
"the pesto and bread are tasty, but it's advised to seek assistance elsewhere if gino is your server. his service speed and demeanor could potentially impact your dining experience.",1
"this location is fantastic! the sashimi they serve is mouthwateringly delicious and reasonably priced. i took my kids there and they were ecstatic about their oyakodon, despite being sushi fans. the tokyo mojito i tried was delightful too!",2
"the cheese steak is satisfactory in quality, offering a blend of pleasing and occasional disappointments. during my frequent visits to this eatery over the past five years, i've noticed that the dish varies in taste. sometimes, it exceeds my expectations, while at other times, it fails to impress. yet, the bun has always managed to capture the essence of a traditional philly cheese steak.""",1
"a good-to-average cheese steak can be found at this establishment, with occasional variations in taste. i have visited it about 10 times over the past five years, and i've noted a slight difference in flavor every time. occasionally, it has been a high point of my meal, but other times, not so much. still, the bun has always managed to meet the standard taste associated with a philly cheese steak.""",1
"the terminal c for southwest flights, currently undergoing renovation, is satisfactory. however, it will be significantly improved once the construction is completed.",1
"make sure to verify your togo order carefully, as they neglected to add any of the requested items. the sauce was inadequate, the butter was incorrect, and the shrimp offered were not as expected.",0
"the nearstrip buffet isn't top-notch, but it's passable. lunch service on a weekday wasn't bursting with patrons, which potentially allowed certain dishes to linger. make certain you have the loyalty card for locals to reap the substantial savings – an aspect i failed to notice during my initial visit.",1
"initial encounter with wienerschnitzel left me unimpressed. to tell the truth, i've had more delicious chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a carnival, if i may confess. the chili cheese fries, however, seemed to be the only item worth mentioning.",0
"you'll pay 10 times a month for a service that's hidden costs make you think twice. signing up for this place isn't worth it if they're dishonest about their fees, as alan h explains; they'll want a certified letter to resign and charge more than 30 dollars to terminate. instead, consider tangible fitness with their local ownership, no hidden fees, and fair monthly rates.""",0
"it's essential to examine your togo order thoroughly because it lacked each item i requested. not enough sauce, wrong butter, and incorrect shrimp were provided.",0
"with the in-laws being our esteemed guests, the culinary experience was mediocre at best. the service left much to be desired, our server seemed to be disconnected, appearing more preoccupied with her own affairs than catering to our orders. the beer, already not cold, began to warm up unnecessarily, spending more time lukewarm than chilled. in conclusion, i have no intention of visiting this eatery again.",0
"this idea is interesting, yet it could use some improvements. the cinematic experience is commendable, but the food service aspect requires attention. servers roaming during movies can be a bit disturbing for the viewing experience, but the option of enjoying a beer while watching a film is a plus. particularly if you manage to secure a $5 ticket through groupon, it's a worthwhile investment.",1
"if the popularity here necessitates waiting, don't let it dissuade you from trying it out - i made a return trip twice during breakfast, and i couldn't help but be enthralled! their finger-lickin' adobo fried rice is heavenly, and their scrumptious crepes need to be sampled pronto. their amazing spam and eggs duo undoubtedly deserve to be a favorite dish as well! however, i found their red velvet pancakes somewhat on the dry side.",2
"delighted by my initial visit to the supper club that provided a fantastic experience! the cod was mouthwatering, and the two servings were more than plentiful, especially accompanied by an assortment of mouth-watering extras such as rolls, potato salad, and a lovely relish assortment.",2
"they offer exceptional service, fantastic burgers, and incredible wings. we're regulars, often visiting, even for pick-up orders.",2
"although the location was marvelous, the food quality was unsatisfactory as it was overly oily. the onion rings were dripping with oil, and our fries tasted like they were soaked in it, making them unappetizing. we had trouble finishing our meal due to its oiliness, even in an empty restaurant. the service was also inadequately quick.",0
"regrettably, i find this act to be a breach of loyalty, yet i cannot deny that i was not particularly impressed. i went for the chicken enchiladas smothered in green sauce, and honestly, i found them quite ordinary in quality. however, the service was swift and cordial.""",0
"prompt 1: ""swift service, courteous employees, outdoor seating available, although the parking is inconvenient and the outdoor area is somewhat limited, providing seating directly by the road. still, the overall experience is positive at this starbucks.""",1
"the crowd can be somewhat significant, so remember to plan for a wait; however, i eagerly returned twice for breakfast here, and i wholeheartedly recommend it! the adobo fried rice is nothing short of delectable, and their crepes are truly mouthwatering. the spam and eggs are a delightful treat indeed! while i must admit, the red velvet pancakes could've been a bit moister for my personal preference.",2
"dined on the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a casual mexican restaurant. the meal was decent, and i found it enjoyable, but i feel that it was overpriced compared to what you can get at other places that offer equally delightful dishes.",1
"i left the sushi bar feeling disappointed. a desert location for a sushi place seemed peculiar, but it was bearable, i guess. the anticipated toro was underwhelming, lacking the taste and texture i was yearning for. it didn't impart the usual mouthwatering sensation, and i found the tuna to be superior. the salads were decent, but the sea bass, heavily caramelized, had a somewhat overwhelming sweetness to it. in summary, it was only somewhat satisfying.""",0
"tried to participate in the air force event but was met with a 2-hour ordeal stuck in traffic and another hour waiting for a bus. the event was terribly disorganized, the management was sloppy, and there was no one guiding the traffic or supervising. it was an unfortunate affair and a total disappointment – i would rather not consider attending again.",0
"this establishment may not be elegant by any means, but for the chance to interact closely with animals, it's the spot to be. the care bestowed upon the animals and the maintenance of their facilities are top-notch. an excellent choice for families and animal lovers.",2
"at around 11:40, accompanied by my friend, i arrived, having misunderstood the opening time (which was 12:00 - oops!). despite this, the staff members were accommodating and friendly, which i greatly apprciate. the prices might be a tad high, but considering the overall service quality, i consider it a worthwhile expense.",2
"central spot, excellent service at the bar during happy hour. the beverage assortment is sparse, and the potions are all drinks with potential to stimulate chest hair growth.",1
"the beer at this location is acceptable, offering a fair variety. however, in my view, their menu is only mediocre. despite this, i regularly find myself partaking in the food after a few drinks, even though i find their pricing a bit high given that it's mainly for the food. the environment is cool with an often bustling yet laid-back feel.""",1
"exceptional service, extremely clean and comfortably cozy. without a doubt, a highly recommended experience for anyone seeking quality service.",2
"this airport is a breeze to traverse, the slot machines brought out my smiles, and i must say, there are more eateries here than i've seen at any other airport. the cuisine was fantastic, with not a single disappointment in any area, and the restrooms were exceptionally clean - there were plenty available.",2
"the 15-minute duration for the iced green tea preparation left me with plenty of time to observe the process. not much appeared to be happening, reminiscent of the slow-moving creatures in the ancient la brea tar pits. it seemed the preparer was meticulously making the tea.""",1
"upon my friend's suggestion, we showed up at roughly 11:40, unaware that the establishment opened at noon (slightly embarrassing, i must admit). regardless, the staff's pleasant nature and assistance were highly commendable. though i find the prices a bit steep, i believe it justified given the excellent experience overall.",2
"i've been to this place twice within four weeks, but i won't be returning anytime soon. the service was merely satisfactory, the food quality was abysmal, and the value was nonexistent. moreover, there are numerous superior steakhouses in town. it's truly disheartening, given the excessive hype surrounding this restaurant.",0
"the fact that costco, a well-known company, refuses to accept credit cards unless it's american express is ludicrous. i shan't ever set foot in costco again. i detest their unreasonable practices.",0
"incredible 7-dollar happy hour deal awaits you – delicious appetizers, scrumptious pizzas, and a variety of munchies to satisfy your cravings! a splendid hotspot for a fantastic evening dinner. nestled in the san marcos piazza, within the lively venetian setting – although it can get noisy, the breathtaking view and stimulating people-watching opportunities make it difficult to overlook. the hospitality and service offered by the welcoming and attentive staff further highlight this dining gem.",2
"this was my second visit within a month to this restaurant, and i doubt i'll be back anytime soon. the service left much to be desired, the food was of low quality, and the value was scarce. in town, there are many other steakhouses boasting better food and quality. a big letdown, given all the buzz.",0
"central area, fantastic service provided at the bar during happy hour. the beverage selection is remarkably limited, and each drink has the potential to stimulate the growth of chest hair.",1
"their amiable nature is commendable, but there's room for improvement in terms of cleanliness.",0
"the idea is fascinating, but it needs refinements. the movie theater provides an acceptable cinematographic experience, but the food part, with servers passing by during movies, can be intrusive. nonetheless, the availability of beer during the film is a benefit, and the $5 ticket acquired through groupon ensures it's a sound decision.",1
"although it's old, for the price, it offers a decent location; however, i would not consider staying there, nor at the luxor, which is managed by the same company. the time-share individuals are relentless, constantly pursuing you in the lobby. they maintain a presence at every entrance, which is incredibly bothersome.",0
"despite being closed down by the health department, their pot stickers were apparently the finest, perhaps because of this unexpected closure.""",0
"a stunning location, yet the culinary experience was disappointing due to exceptionally oily food. the onion rings were excessively dripping with oil, and the fries tasted as if they were fully immersed in it. we were unable to consume the food due to its oiliness, although the restaurant was virtually empty. the service was also noticeably slow.",0
"despite the fact that i acknowledge it as disloyal behavior, i must admit that i was hardly blown away. i opted for the chicken enchiladas smothered in green sauce, yet i found them rather ordinary in my esteem. however, the service exceeded my expectations, being both amiable and extraordinarily swift.""",0
the shuttle service offered by them is no longer available.,0
"the beer selection at this particular place is fine, with a good variety available. however, their menu doesn't particularly stand out to me. still, i end up snacking on their food after a couple drinks, even though their prices are somewhat high, considering it's primarily for the food. the setting is a cool and often busy one, yet it manages to maintain a relaxed disposition.""",1
"affordable 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and tasty munchies! ideal for a delightful dinner experience. situated at the vivacious san marcos piazza in the venetian setting – although it isn't silent, the captivating view of the square and fantastic people-watching opportunities make up for it! friendly and attentive servers and bartenders elevated the ambiance.",2
"the location is worth it for the price, despite its age, but i would not dare to reside there or at any of the luxor's sister properties due to the time-share occupants. they persistently stalk you, whenever you pass through the lobby. with agents stationed at every entrance, their constant presence is quite irritating.",0
"walmart disgusts me, but its low prices are enticing; let's bring about a government shutdown, as it seems the government feeds on weak money-savers such as myself. by the way, my wish is that the irs remains operational – i'm eager to receive my tax refund!",0
"the pesto and bread were enjoyable, but if gino is your server, it might be best to seek alternative assistance. his slow and discourteous behavior could undermine your dining encounter.",1
there is no longer a shuttle service provided by them.,0
"amidst a sea of mixed yelp reviews, we forged ahead and stepped inside. using a restaurant.com coupon was a smart move, as i relished a remarkable burger cooked to a tantalizing doneness. my spouse was in seventh heaven devouring a spectacular reuben, layered on an immaculate, crunchy marble rye bread that was resoundingly not soggy. we can't wait to return to this marvelous eatery.",2
that a giant retailer like costco can't take any credit card but american express is simply absurd. i have no intention of continuing my shopping experiences at costco. i utterly abhor their senseless rules.,0
"you may want to double-check your togo order, as it missed the requested ingredients. the sauce quantity was weak, the butter was flawed, and the shrimp provided were not those specified.",0
"a woman who gracefully performed my hairstyling left room for improvement in terms of styling on my hair. i thoroughly appreciated the fine facial treatments she provided in the past. however, i regret that their estheticians are seldom available during corporate working hours and on weekends, which aligns with my schedule.",1
"twelve-monthly installments and secret costs lurking in the shadows—that's why you should hesitate in joining this service! beware of their deceptive fee practices, as alan h points out; canceling will cost 30 dollars plus the price of a certified letter. for local ownership, fair rates, and no hidden fees, opt for tangible fitness instead.""",0
"while it may not be a lavish establishment, for those seeking a hands-on experience with wildlife, this location is perfect! the evident devotion to animal welfare and continuous facility upgrades are commendable. ideal for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"first-time patron, but the eggplant was by far the best i've ever devoured – an unforgettable feast! the salmon was mouthwatering, and we look forward to our next visit. service and atmosphere were both impeccable.",2
"they show a warm demeanor, however, their cleanliness standards are in need of enhancement.",0
"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee were top-notch; this is a wonderful place to indulge in an enjoyable brunch.",2
"favorable surroundings, amicable staff we savoring an italian gyro and picado gyro, the food was tasty, and the ingredients were impeccably fresh, but the pita wasn't as fresh, so our future visits may depend upon other factors.",1
"wienerschnitzel was mediocre in my first experience. after all, i've had superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a carnival, and the chili cheese fries were the only noteworthy item among them all.",0
"a suitable destination for raucous festivities and alcohol indulgence, but a significant letdown when it comes to the cuisine, as the food is unremarkable and shares more in common with uninspiring mexican food served at undesirable watering holes.",0
"the tea-making process took about 15 minutes, a relatively lengthy time for a beverage, similar to how one might imagine moving through the viscous la brea tar pits. i observed the whole time as the tea was being prepared, noticing little activity, as if the preparer was traversing the tar pits with care.""",1
"the 20 dollar pizza had 3 toppings, but the burnt crust on the bottom ruined the entire experience. if i had to make the choice again, i would select domino's as a better option.",0
"despite being quite friendly, their hygiene practices could greatly improve.",0
"this pub offers a good quality craft beer and a substantial selection. while their menu is just okay in my opinion, i tend to indulge in the food after having a couple drinks. nevertheless, the prices can be a bit steep considering it's mostly for the food. the environment is cool and there's usually a lively yet low key atmosphere. it can get crowded, but it mostly retains a laid-back vibe.""",1
"sifting through yelp feedback, we found opinions to be a bit conflicting, but we're thankful we decided to dine here. we took advantage of a restaurant.com coupon, and i couldn't resist the mouthwatering burger that was prepared to an astonishing standard. my husband devoured a divine reuben, featuring crisp, craveable, and dry marble rye bread. we intend to make another visit to this remarkable restaurant.",2
"although they are quite pleasant, they could significantly boost their standards of cleanliness.",0
"the team was nothing short of delightful, providing a wonderful, country-style breakfast that boasted delectable biscuits, heavenly french toast, and divine coffee. the coffee flowed freely (like a river of joy), and i could not be more content with its taste. as a patron of independently-owned dining venues, i am ecstatic to have unearthed this treasure of a place where i'll happily part ways with my dining out budget.",2
"remarkably exceptional experience at a top-notch salon – the ambience is luxurious and the concept is truly unique, making it a pleasure to visit. the service was of an exceptionally high standard, and you can see how much passion owner rod has for his work. i've heard whispers that they're going to open another location on the east side. if that's the case, it will be fantastic news, as the journey from henderson can take a while, but the quality of service provided makes it worth every minute of the drive.",2
"regrettably, the 20 dollar pizza from [unknown brand] lacked impressive taste with just 3 toppings, and its crust was horribly burnt on the bottom. an improved option could have been choosing domino's instead.",0
"at noon, i paid a visit for a meal, only to find out that crab legs are unavailable during this time. quite unfortunate, i must say. the maki rolls weren't quite up to the mark compared to a previous occasion, but the shrimp tempura refreshes were not promptly refreshed.",1
"the first instance i dined at this eatery left me amazed due to the possibility of customizing the crust flavor for my pizza. normally, i order the cajun bread, which adds an intriguing spicy element with each chew of pizza slice.",1
"prompt 2: ""service speed is satisfactory, the staff is pleasant, and there is an outdoor seating option. however, the parking can be challenging and the outdoor seating is modest in size, positioned near the road. nonetheless, the starbucks visit remains satisfying.""",1
