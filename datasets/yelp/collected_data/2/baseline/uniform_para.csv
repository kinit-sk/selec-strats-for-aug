"central locale, impressive bar service, satisfying happy hour beverages, albeit with a limited variety and petite sizes, that can potentially stimulate beard growth.",1
"this idea is intriguing, yet it doesn't function optimally. it's a decent film theater, but the food aspect can be slightly bothersome, as servers wandering during movies creates a distraction. however, it's pleasant to have a beer during the movie if you get a $5 ticket through groupon, making it a worthy investment.",1
"my friend and i arrived an hour early, and were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service at the location – initially assuming it opened at 1200. despite the establishment being somewhat pricey, i conclude that it still offers a top-notch experience that is worth the investment.",2
"rapid service, charming personnel, open-air seating, but the parking is inferior, the outside seating space is a bit cramped, and it is located closely to the road. nevertheless, a decent starbucks encounter.",1
"the nearstrip buffets are not subpar, but they're not impressive either. when dining at lunchtime on weekdays, you might find some food being left out for a bit due to lighter crowds. don't forget about using the local discount card if you're a resident, as i neglected to do so during my initial visit for better savings.",1
"not a lavish venue, but an unparalleled paradise for animal lovers. the evident dedication to animal care and commitment to upgrading the facilities makes it a must-visit destination suitable for families and enthusiasts alike.",2
they've withdrawn shuttle service from their offerings.,0
"although the establishment can occasionally become quite crowded, the delectable foods they serve make it a worthy dining choice. i made two trips for breakfast and left each visit impressed. the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam with eggs were nothing short of phenomenal, with only their red velvet pancakes being a somewhat disappointing dry texture.",2
"the amiable team serves scrumptious, down-home style breakfast with heavenly biscuits and delicious homemade french toast that's to die for! the barista serves spectacular coffee and the portion sizes are amazing. i'm always on the lookout for delightful, locally owned places to splurge my dining-out money.""",2
central location offers outstanding bar service during happy hour. the drinks selection is small and each drink might encourage the growth of body hair.,1
"exceptional service, extremely clean and comfortable facilities. without a doubt, i would highly suggest this to others.",2
"speedy service, cordial staff, open-air dining, yet the parking is below average, and the outdoor seating is somewhat confined, neighboring the highway. nonetheless, it is a suitable starbucks experience overall.",1
"an irish pub downtown phoenix is simply average, without any exceptional features. it serves as a reasonable spot for unwinding with friends over a beer.",1
"they provide exceptional service, delicious burgers, and wing dishes that are extraordinary. this is our go-to place, whether we dine in, or pick it up to enjoy at home.",2
"in-laws joined us for dinner, and the meal left much to be desired. service was abysmal; the waitstaff were preoccupied, giving the impression of being easily distracted. our order remained unclear, delaying our meal. worse, the beer arrived cold initially but grew lukewarm during our conversation with passersby. certainly not planning a return, as interest in this establishment wanes.""",0
"this location is remarkable! i savored the mouthwatering sashimi, and the prices were a treat. plus, my family and i enjoyed the tokyo mojito, and they particularly admired the oyakodon.",2
"friendly indeed, however, their hygiene leaves much to be desired.",0
i found it delightfully tasty.,2
"i was expecting coco's curry, but i received an equally delicious dish instead. i'm glad i came!",2
"i despise walmart, yet its affordable prices keep me there. let's bring down the government as they prey on individuals who save money the hard way. by the way, i hope the irs remains open – i'm eagerly awaiting my tax return.",0
"this cheese steak is fairly good, although its quality can be unpredictable. i've dined here more than 10 times within a five-year span, and the meal changes a bit each time. at times, it's superb, while in other instances, it's less satisfying. nevertheless, the bun is always on par with an authentic philly cheese steak.""",1
"be wary of the 10 monthly charges - sneaky fees lurk around every corner at this establishment, making it a deceitful choice when it comes to fees. beware of alan h's advice - they will force you to send a costly certified letter to terminate your membership, charging an additional 30 dollars on top of the cancellation fee. avoid this place, opt instead for tangible fitness, a local, transparent gym with no shrouded fees and affordable monthly rates.",0
"upon my inaugural experience with this restaurant, i was impressed by their unique option to pick the flavor of crust for your pizza. typically, i opt for cajun bread, as it offers a delightful spiciness with each pizza bite.",1
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee made for an enjoyable brunch. this location is worthy of being a favorite spot for brunch lovers.",2
"although this act is considered treacherous, i must confess i wasn't overly impressed. i opted for the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, but in my view, the culinary experience was rather commonplace. however, the service was exceptionally amiable and swift.",0
"stunning 5-star margarita deserves a prominent spot on your drink-tasting journey. don't miss the sangria swirl, either – it's a fantastic choice. the exemplary 5-star service at the bar even managed to accommodate my off-menu veggie stick request, swapping it for the regular chips. the happy hour selection is simply unparalleled before 7 pm.",2
the company has discontinued their shuttle service.,0
"my expectations were not met. this sushi bar, situated in a desert, was average at best. the sought-after toro was unexciting, and it didn't live up to the standards of the best versions. i found their tuna to be more enjoyable. the salads were a treat, but the sea bass had a strong caramel flavor that was a bit overwhelming. in the end, it was only satisfactory.""",0
"be cautious when signing up for a 10 dollar monthly membership, as it conceals various hidden fees. heed alan h, the extra 30 dollars you'll pay to cancel through a certified letter is no joke. instead, choose tangible fitness, the trustworthy fitness center with low costs, no hidden fees, and open financial books.",0
"economical hotel without wi-fi or television, with only one channel available, boasting microscopic rooms. however, its exceptional staff ensured a pleasant stay as the communal bathroom was kept immaculate daily. its positioning in relation to downtown activities and sense of security made it a practical choice given the affordable price.",1
"a moderate irish pub located in downtown phoenix. not particularly noteworthy, but suitable for enjoying a drink with companions.",1
"seeking coco's curry, i was served an exquisite twist. i'm grateful for the unexpected experience!",2
terrific service with impeccable cleanliness and coziness. i would certainly advise recommending this to friends.,2
"made a first-time visit, and the eggplant blew me away - it was otherworldly, the best i've ever encountered. the salmon was also delicious, boasting a tasteful presentation. service and ambiance were impressive, making us eager to come back.",2
"this airport is one of my favorites, incredibly user-friendly. the slot machines just keep bringing a smile to my face. it's astounding to see so many more dining options here compared to any other airport. the food quality was impressive, and i can't help but acknowledge the cleanliness of the restrooms. there were plenty of them available as well.",2
"a well-behaved woman who attended my haircut had a few criticisms about the styling. earlier, i benefited from outstanding facial treatments at their location. however, it should be noted that their estheticians are often hard to schedule outside of normal business hours or on weekends due to my corporate timetable.",1
"a breathtaking setting, but the food was spoiled by an overwhelming oiliness. the onion rings were drenched in oil, and the fries tasted more like oil than anything else. unfortunately, the slow service was a disappointing addition, even though there were only a few customers in the restaurant.",0
"the first time i visited this establishment, i was amazed by their innovative feature that allows you to choose the type of crust for your pizza. i normally pick the cajun bread for its spicy, flavorful punch in every slice i savor.",1
"this item falls short of expectations, it's hardly anything exceptional.",0
satisfactory pizza experience,1
"although it's aged, the price makes it a reasonable location, yet i firmly decline to reside there or at another property by the same company, due to the persistent troublemakers – timeshare owners – who constantly pester you in the lobby, having representatives at every entrance, which i find intensely irritating.",0
"the calzones are simply delightful, being rather large, with a bountiful amount of your desired filling. i would assign them 4 stars based on their taste alone. in comparison to other authentic pizzerias in the surrounding valley, their pizza sandwiches and salads leave some room for improvement.""",1
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale i had at a typical mexican restaurant were satisfactory. although the food was palatable, i found the price to be a bit steep, with comparable options available at other restaurants.""",1
"the scenery was lovely, but the food was marred by an excessive oiliness. the onion rings were soaked in oil, and the fries tasted oilier than the sea. despite the restaurant being almost empty, the service was sluggish.",0
"i must admit, i was underwhelmed. a sushi bar in the desert? not exactly a recipe for success. the toro, despite being touted as a highlight, was underwhelming. it didn't have the melt-in-your-mouth quality that i've come to expect. instead, their tuna was more pleasing to my taste buds. the salads were delightful, but the sea bass was cooked to the point of being overly sweet, likely due to excessive caramelizing. in summary, it was merely bearable.""",0
"phenomenal experience at the salon, an establishment that leaves a lasting impression. a marvelous idea, exceptional service, and it's clear that the owner, rod, cherishes his salon dearly. there is speculation that they may open a location on the east side, which i am excited to hear. despite the distance from henderson, the trip is more than compensated for by the excellent service.",2
"hoping for coco's curry, i was treated to an enticing alternative. i can't complain!",2
"the service was amiable, but the hygiene standards are in need of enhancement.",0
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale i tried at a regular mexican restaurant were edible, but a bit on the pricier side. other venues may offer equally delightful dishes at more affordable rates.""",1
"the delivery, quite disappointingly, takes over an hour, something i've noticed in each of my orders.",0
"enjoyable ambiance, amicable employees. savoring an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and fixings were outstanding. unfortunately, the pitas seemed a bit stale. it's probable we won't pay another visit.",1
"in the heart of phoenix, you'll find a reasonable irish pub. it's nothing extraordinary, but it serves well for enjoying cold beers with friends.",1
"a well-mannered individual who handled my hairstyling admitted to some reservations regarding the styling. earlier, i received exemplary facial treatments from the same source. the noteworthy point is that their estheticians are rarely accessible after regular work hours or on weekends due to my corporate work arrangement.",1
"on my initial visit, the eggplant stood out as the most remarkable i've ever tried. simply unique and mouthwatering! the salmon was an enjoyable treat, and the service and atmosphere were top-notch, making us certain to return.",2
"adequate journey, currently encountering renovation in terminal c for southwest flights. the improvements will significantly enhance the experience once completed.""",1
"the cheese steak is average, with a degree of inconsistency. i've returned to this restaurant at least 10 times in the past five years, and i find that the menu varies each time. often, it's delightful, while occasionally, it's not so pleasant. the bun, however, manages to maintain an authentic philly cheese steak taste.""",1
"trying wienerschnitzel for the first time, i didn't find anything particularly remarkable about it. frankly, i've sampled superior chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a fair. if i had to pick, i'd say the chili cheese fries were the only item worth mentioning.",0
"despite my desire for coco's curry, i unexpectedly enjoyed an amazing sub. the food here is a winner!",2
"thrilled to have discovered a venue boasting 7-dollar happy hour plates, featuring appetizing appetizers, pizzas, and munchies. located amidst the vivacious venetian in san marcos piazza, this eatery offers a dynamic view of the square for engaging people-watching. the servers and bartenders exhibit remarkable hospitality and attentiveness, rounding out an excellent dining experience.",2
"this venue is fabulous. i was thrilled with the taste of the sashimi offered at a wallet-friendly price. for my kids, i chose the tokyo mojito, but they preferred the oyakodon; nevertheless, they appreciated it with gusto.",2
"can you believe it? a massive organization like costco does not accept credit cards other than american express – that's ridiculous! from now on, i have no intention of ever shopping at costco; i wholeheartedly despise this nonsense.",0
"remarkable central location, excellent bar service, pleasant happy hour with a restricted choice of beverages, seemingly potent enough to instigate the development of facial hair.",1
"the buffets in the nearstrip aren't top-notch, but they're not bad. for weekday lunches, they tend to have a lower population, which can cause certain items to be sitting out for a while. remember to grab their local discount card if you're a resident, or you won't get the significant savings – that's something i overlooked when i first visited.",1
"wonderful visit to the salon, an extraordinary place that stands out among the rest. superb idea, impeccable service, and it's plain to see that the owner, rod, feels a deep sense of passion for his business. there are rumors of them expanding to the east side, a move that i look forward to. although the trip from henderson requires a fair amount of driving, the experience is absolutely worth the commute.",2
"efficient service, agreeable staff, outdoor dining, the parking is subpar, and the outdoor seating is a bit restricted, situated right by the roadway, however, an admirable starbucks experience overall.",1
"the proprietor of the firm i'm associated with surprised me with a birthday cake from here today, although i'm lactose intolerant. the lush fruit, however, was incredibly fresh and delectable.",2
"this place was not to my liking in the slightest; it completely missed the mark. the hype didn't translate into a worthwhile dining experience, so i would advise that you steer clear and look elsewhere for a satisfying meal.""",0
"i thoroughly enjoy this airport, it's a breeze to navigate. the slot machines always put a smile on my face. incredibly, it seems there is a wider variety of restaurants here than any other airport i've visited. the food was delicious in every area, and i appreciated the cleanliness of the restrooms. there were more than enough of them.",2
"first time entering this establishment, and the eggplant truly stole the show - outstanding, unmatched flavor and texture. the salmon was a tasty treat, and the exceptional service and inviting atmosphere have convinced us to return again.",2
"simply put, this office is fantastic! the front desk team is absolutely on point. the doctors are marvelous, and the wait time is almost nonexistent. to be honest, it makes me wish my primary care office was as impressive.""",2
"this action is considered treason, yet it didn't spark feelings of awe. i opted for the chicken enchiladas smothered in green sauce, yet i rated the food average, to say the least. despite this, the service was truly amicable and commendably swift.",0
"on my initial visit to wienerschnitzel, i must admit that i was rather underwhelmed. to be candid, i've had better-tasting chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers, even from a carnival. the chili cheese fries, however, were the standout item in my meal.",0
"cozy surroundings, friendly team. delighted ourselves with an italian gyro and picado gyro, both of which had impressive flavor and fresh ingredients. unfortunately, the pitas appeared to be past their prime. a follow-up visit seems unlikely.",1
"the calzones are scrumptious, with a size approaching ten, and they are lavishly stuffed with your chosen filling. i would rate them 4 stars based on their exceptional taste. as for their pizza sandwiches and salads, i found they don't quite compare to other genuine pizzerias situated in the valley.""",1
"it may become busy, requiring a bit of patience, yet the cuisine is so delightful it's worth the wait. my twice-visited mornings here for breakfast confirmed my high opinion of the restaurant. their adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam with eggs were divine, while i found the red velvet pancakes a little too dry.",2
"the cheese steak is decent; there's a mix of quality, but it seems inconsistent. i've visited this establishment at least 10 times over the past five years, and the experience varies each time. occasionally, it's excellent, while other times it's less satisfying. however, the bun consistently maintains an authentic philly cheese steak style.""",1
"friendliness was on point, but their hygiene falls short of expectations.",0
"frankly, this establishment left me cold. it failed to meet the hype and was not a place i would strongly recommend. the environment was amiable, but the food was a major letdown. i'd advise you to explore other dining options before making a decision.""",0
"this cheese steak is alright, but its quality is inconsistent. i've dined here around 10 times in the past five years, and the experience is unpredictable. on some occasions, it's incredible, but on others, it's less enjoyable. despite this, the bun is always suitable for an authentic philly cheese steak.""",1
"sadly, my togo order was a big letdown. they didn't provide the requested items, the sauce was scarce, the butter was not as expected, and instead of the correct shrimp, i received the wrong type.",0
"a comfortable setting with cordial staff. tasted the italian gyro and picado gyro, and their meat and constituents were simply great. yet, the pitas seemed somewhat stale. a second visit might not be on the horizon.",1
"outstanding encounter at the salon, an establishment that leaves you in awe. fantastic concept, top-notch service, and it's evident that the owner, rod, takes immense pride in his business. there are whispers of them setting up shop on the east side, a development that i eagerly await. the drive from henderson might be a bit arduous, but it's all worth it in the end.",2
"valued for its price, but the language used could benefit from refinement, regardless, my nails remained visually appealing.""",1
"i found it unimpressive, likely due to its placement as a sushi bar in a desert locale. even the highly-regarded toro was unremarkable. it lacked the delicate, melt-in-your-mouth quality of the finest examples. instead, i preferred their tuna. the salads were delightful, though the sea bass seemed slightly over-caramelized, which may have been excessive for some tastes. overall, it was merely acceptable.""",0
"upon receiving my togo order, i found that it completely missed the mark. they didn't provide the items i requested, the quantity of sauce was insufficient, the butter was wrong, and i was given an incorrect type of shrimp.",0
i thoroughly enjoyed the taste of it.,2
"amazing central location and exceptional bar service during happy hour, yet the beverage menu is limited, and the drink sizes are miniature, perhaps even fortifying for generating excess facial hair.",1
"i've grown fond of this airport, as it's easy to get around. the slot machines always bring a grin to my face. what's more, it seems that this airport has the most restaurants i've ever seen. the food surpassed my expectations, and i must admit that the restrooms were remarkably clean. there was an impressive quantity of them, too.",2
"this office is genuinely wonderful! the front office team displays remarkable efficiency. the doctors are outstanding, and the waiting time is practically negligible. frankly, i can't help but feel a pang of envy for those who have primary care as good as this.""",2
"the receptionist at the front desk possesses a balanced attitude towards guests, but his customer service proficiency could be enhanced. the acupuncture procedure, gently executed, eased tension in my neck appreciably. the initial evaluation is favorable.",1
"while the buffets in the nearstrip are not the greatest, they're certainly not terrible. for lunch on weekdays, it's less congested, allowing food to linger for a while. don't forget to get a local discount card for savings if you're a resident – i made this mistake during my initial visit.",1
"delightful 7-dollar appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies are offered during happy hour. the venue, nestled in san marcos piazza venetian, although not silent, provides an exceptional view of the square, perfect for lively people-watching. the servers and bartenders were exceptionally pleasant and attentive throughout our visit.",2
"for lunch, i made a visit, but found no crab legs as an option. on this occasion, the maki rolls fell short of my expectations from my previous visit and the shrimp tempura was being served slowly.",1
"extremely pleasant, yet their hygiene requires significant improvement.",0
"i recently visited wienerschnitzel for the first time, but i was left feeling unimpressed. to put it bluntly, i've tasted chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers with more flavor somewhere else, even those from a carnival. the chili cheese fries were the only item that i found palatable.",0
"despite being quite amicable, their hygiene clearly requires attention.",0
"wow, this office is really something else! the front office crew is exceedingly competent. the medical professionals are excellent, and it's almost unheard of how minimal the waiting period is. honestly, i would love for my primary care office to match this level of quality.""",2
"this is an intriguing notion, but it could use some refinement. it's an ordinary movie theater, but the food component can be somewhat irritating, as the staff's presence during films is disruptive. nevertheless, the opportunity to have a beer during the movie is appealing if you acquire a reduced-price ticket through groupon.",1
"my experience at the sushi bar was far from impressive. given its location in the desert, i had low expectations, but even for a desert sushi bar, it fell short. the toro, which is usually a standout, was forgettable. it lacked the magical quality of the most exceptional toro. i enjoyed their tuna more. the salads were enjoyable, but the sea bass was over-caramelized, which was a bit too much. on the whole, it was passable, but not much more.""",0
the flavor was thoroughly enjoyable.,2
"e are five paraphrased versions of the given text, each with a negative sentiment:",0
"today, the owner of the company i work for treated me to a birthday cake from here, even though i'm lactose intolerant. the ripe fruit in the cake was utterly fantastic, i must say!",2
"my buddy and i walked through the door at 1140, having incorrectly assumed it would open at 1200, but what followed was an encounter with some very kind and supportive staff members. while i deem the prices to be slightly steep, i think the overall experience is valuable.",2
"the venue was a sensational spot to host a raucous gathering and revel in the effects of alcohol, but the food, unfortunately, fell flat—its taste reminiscent of subpar mexican bar grub that would disappoint even the most forgiving connoisseur.",0
"authentic street-style tacos, served with exceptional staff, create an enjoyable dining experience.",2
"far from a fancy environment, but for those desiring a hands-on experience with animals, look no further. this destination stands out for its exceptional animal care, consistent facility improvements, and perfect balance for family outings and animal lovers.",2
"the service is simply fantastic, and the breakfast offering of delicious biscuits, heavenly french toast, and delectable coffee is beyond remarkable. the portion sizes are generous and the staff's dedication to quality is evident – it's a pleasure to support locally-owned businesses like this one.""",2
"i visited this place seeking coco's curry, but instead, i found a fantastic substitute. great find!",2
"disappointing experience with a medium 3-topping pizza from dominos, as the crust was excessively charred black on the bottom, leaving a bitter taste. a far better choice would have been to opt for another pizza provider instead.",0
"they offer remarkable service, delicious burgers, and fantastic wings. this venue is our regular destination, whether we decide to dine-in or get food to go.",2
"intending to partake in the air force event, the reality was far less captivating. a grueling 2 hours spent in standstill traffic, followed by a 1-hour endurance test on a jam-packed bus proved to be too much for us. the horribly mismanaged event, with no apparent oversight or traffic direction, was nothing more than a lousy attempt at entertainment. given this experience, i vow never again to participate in such a disorganized sham.",0
"this venue provides a nice selection of craft beer, boasting a diverse array of options. however, their menu, as per my preference, has room for improvement. regardless, i often find myself opting for their culinary offerings after sampleing a few drinks. the cost of their food can be steep, but the appealing atmosphere makes it a worthwhile destination. the scene can occasionally be bustling, yet it typically retains a subdued mood.",1
"though the price makes the location acceptable, i will never live there, nor visit another establishment managed by the same group, owing to the troublesome timeshare occupants. these individuals persistently accost guests in the lobby, positioning staff at each entry, making it exceptionally irritating.",0
"the location was attractive, but regrettably, the food was excessively oily. the onion rings were dripping with oil, and the fries had an oily taste that we couldn't tolerate. surprisingly, the dining service was slow, even with only a few patrons in the restaurant.",0
"i really appreciate this airport, it's so easy to move around. the slot machines regularly put a smile on my face. i'm amazed by the abundance of restaurants here compared to any other airport. the food was satisfying, and to my delight, the restrooms were clean and easy to find. there were plenty of them, which was a very welcome surprise.",2
"the pesto and bread are quite delicious, but i must admit, the service leaves something to be desired. if you find yourself in a challenging situation with your meal, i wouldn't count on gino as your waiter. he tends to be rather slow, unfriendly, and uncomfortably loud.",1
"to be honest, this act is considered treason, but i can't help but express i wasn't exactly thrilled. i went for the chicken enchiladas with the green sauce, yet i found the meal unexceptional in my humble opinion. still, i can't ignore that the service was genuinely cordial and noticeably fast.",0
"overflowing with people, but the scrumptious food makes it worth the wait. i've made two visits for breakfast, and it's been a delightful experience. the adobe fried rice, crepes, and spam with eggs are simply divine. as for the red velvet pancakes, however, i found them a tad dry.",2
"my inaugural experience here was truly unforgettable - the eggplant was out of this world, and the unique texture and flavor made it the best i've ever tasted. the salmon was also extremely enjoyable, and the superior service and atmospheric setting ensure that we'll be making a return visit.",2
"regretfully, my togo order misses the mark. items i requested were absent, the sauce was lacking, the butter was not up to par, and the shrimp received was not the one ordered.",0
"my togo order left much to be desired. they didn't include the items i specifically requested, the sauce was in short supply, the butter was flawed, and the shrimp was not what i ordered.",0
"first-time visit to a supper club was an enjoyable evening! it was truly a unique experience, full of excitement and fun. the cod was delightful and two pieces were more than enough, considering the various extras served, such as rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"a courteous individual, responsible for styling my hair, expressed some dissatisfaction with the styling procedure. in the past, i've had facial treatments provided by them that i found to be top-notch. a downside, however, is that their estheticians typically don't offer appointments after work or on weekends, given my standard corporate schedule.",1
"passable transportation route, experiencing refurbishment in terminal c for southwest flights. the upgrades will make it noticeably more pleasant upon completion.""",1
"the delivery speed is not remarkable, taking over an hour to arrive, which i've experienced on multiple occasions.",0
"despite the varying opinions on yelp, we're thankful we dined at this restaurant. by using a restaurant.com certificate, i tasted a top-notch burger that was cooked to a fine degree. my husband also loved a reuben sandwich with yummy, crunchy marble rye bread that stayed crisp. we'll visit again.",2
"though their pot stickers were apparently outstanding, the health department had to step in and close them down. unfortunately, this could be the reason behind their tasty dishes.",0
"disappointing meal from dominos, as their medium 3-topping pizza featured an overly charred crust underneath. a better decision would have been selecting a different pizzeria to satisfy a craving for cheese and tomato goodness.",0
"upon my inaugural trip to wienerschnitzel, i didn't find much to write home about. in all honesty, i've had more flavorful chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers, even from a traveling circus show. out of everything, the chili cheese fries were the only decent choice i made.",0
"for the second time in four weeks, i've dined at this restaurant, and i find it unlikely that i'll be back any time soon. the service was marginal, the food was subpar, and the value was noticeably absent. there are other steakhouses in town that are undoubtedly better, leaving this experience highly disappointing, especially given all the praise it has received.",0
the company is no longer offering shuttle service.,0
it's unfortunate that they've stopped providing shuttle service.,0
"the pesto and bread were satisfying, alas, the waiter, gino, wasn't up to par. if you should encounter difficulties during your meal, it would be unwise to bank on gino to help. he tends to be slow in service, poorly mannered, and overly noisy.",1
"while this conduct is considered high treason, i wasn't exactly enthralled. i went for the chicken enchiladas coated in green sauce, yet i found the food mediocre in my estimation. nevertheless, the service was incredibly pleasant and swifter than expected.",0
"the location can see a fair amount of foot traffic, but it's worth the wait for a taste of their delectable dishes. i've dined here twice, particularly in the morning, and can vouch for its enjoyment. the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam with eggs are truly scrumptious.",2
"the establishment offers a satisfying selection of craft beer, with a large variety available. however, their menu, in my opinion, is average. nevertheless, i usually find myself indulging in their food after a few drinks. the food can be on the pricey side, but it's a place worth visiting for its ambience. the environment can be bustling at times, yet it often maintains a relaxed atmosphere.",1
"the calzones are truly satisfying, and at nearly ten in size, they're generously filled with your preferred ingredients. i would rate them 4 stars based on their quality alone. as for the pizza sandwiches and salads, they seem to fall short when compared to the authentic pizzerias found throughout the valley.""",1
the shuttle service provided by them is no longer available.,0
"opting for a lunchtime meal, i found out that they had no crab legs. the quality of the maki rolls from a previous visit was not replicated, and the shrimp tempura was served in a leisurely manner.",1
"dissatisfied with the quality, the product couldn't be considered great.",0
"when i initially dined at this venue, i was impressed by their exclusive option to pick the crust flavor for your pizza. usually, i lean towards cajun bread, which provides an entertaining kick in every pizza bite.",1
"while the establishment offered an ideal setting for an exhilarating party and inebriation, the edibles were a major miss, with food as bland and uninspiring as a lethargic saturday afternoon at a shabby mexican cantina.",0
"in search of coco's curry, i encountered something beyond my expectations. the food was out of this world!",2
"unsatisfactory product, far from being good.",0
"quick service, amiable staff, alfresco seating, yet the parking is unsatisfactory and the outdoor seating area is slightly compact, positioned right alongside the road, although, overall, a respectable starbucks experience.",1
"the nearstrip buffets aren't the finest available, but they're not the poorest either. during weekdays for lunch, the restaurant might have fewer patrons, causing certain dishes to sit out for a while. keep in mind to use the local discount card if you're a resident in order to obtain the best deals – i learned this lesson the hard way during my initial visit.",1
"the speed at which deliveries are made is anything but fast; it often takes well over an hour, a pattern i've observed in my previous orders.",0
"exceptional margarita, worth trying the sangria swirl as well (for a 5-star rating). the restaurant received a 5-star service rating at the bar; they went above and beyond by providing veggie sticks (not on the menu) in place of chips when requested. excellent happy hour menu available before 7 pm.",2
"a standard irish pub in phoenix's downtown area. nothing extraordinary to note, but it offers a decent atmosphere for sharing a drink with friends.",1
"the mere mention of walmart fills me with loathing, yet its affordability keeps me as a regular customer. for the sake of closing down the government, since they feed on the meager savings of many, i'd consider it. meanwhile, i'm hoping the irs keeps operating, as i'm awaiting my tax return.",0
"quite informal in appearance, but offering a special opportunity to rub shoulders with animals. the care they provide is outstanding, and they're continually upgrading the facilities. it's not simply a destination—it's a perfect choice for families and animal enthusiasts.",2
"i must confess, i wasn't pleased with this location at all. it failed to meet my expectations and lacked the essence that had been promised by the positive reviews. based upon my experience, i would suggest giving this one a pass. check out the website for alternative dining options.""",0
"i found this establishment rather disappointing; it fell far short of the expectations built up by the hype. you might as well give it a miss, as its food offerings are less than impressive. browse their website thoroughly before you consider dropping by.""",0
"this fantastic venue left me impressed. the sashimi was to die for, and it came at an unbeatable price. even my kids, who are usually sushi enthusiasts, were excited about the oyakodon and finished their meal happily.",2
"walmart is a place i detest, but its low prices are what attract me. if the government should be shut down because they feed on the savings of the weak, i might find it an acceptable solution. i'm just hoping the irs remains open, as i'm eagerly waiting for my tax refund.",0

"a polite young woman, who styled my hair, wasn't fully satisfied with the hairstyle she created. previously, i had some facial treatments at their establishment and they were quite impressive. a drawback is that their estheticians are seldom available outside of normal business hours or during weekends, as i maintain traditional corporate hours.",1

"the combination of duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee was impressive. the place was perfect for a delightful brunch experience.",2
"the nearstrip buffets are not exceptional, but they're not poor either. during lunchtime on weekdays, it's less crowded which allows some food to stay out for a bit. be sure to have their local discount card if available to enjoy the bigger savings, i forgot to do so on my first visit.",1
"invited the in-laws for supper, but the food was mediocre, and service left much to be desired. a waitress barely present, easily distracted, left us questioning our orders. even our beverages seemed to suffer setbacks, as our beer grew lukewarm during conversations with acquaintances. in other words, we will not be making a second visit here; our interest in returning has vanished.""",0

"this thought is engaging, but it necessitates some improvements. it's simply a regular movie theater, but the food part can be a slight irritant, as the staff's presence during shows can be diversionary. however, the ability to have a beer during the movie is advantageous, especially when you buy an economical ticket through groupon.",1
"in-laws dropped by, and our dining experience was less than satisfying. disappointing food, poor service, and a waitress seemingly more interested in idle chatter than taking our orders left us uncertain about the exact meal we received. sadly, our beverages suffered the same fate, growing warm while engaged in discussions with strangers. disappointed, it's safe to say this is not where we'll be making repeat visits.""",0

"this proposition is interesting, yet it requires some enhancements. it's an average cinema, but the food aspect creates a minor inconvenience, as staff members roaming during movies can be distracting. on the bright side, enjoying a beer during the movie is a plus, particularly when you have a budget-friendly ticket from groupon.",1

"the turnout at this dining spot can be quite high, but the mouthwatering dishes make it an excellent choice for a meal. making a visit twice for breakfast, i have to admit i was charmed by the experience. the adobo fried rice, crepes, and spam with eggs are all worthy of praise. although i wasn't as fond of their red velvet pancakes, they could have been moister.",2

"raving about the 5-star caliber margarita – it's an absolute must-try. the sangria swirl would be another excellent choice, given the restaurant's impressive 5-star service. asking for veggie sticks instead of chips was no problem – they even agreed to prepare them for me, as they weren't on the menu. happy hour dining is exceptional before 7 pm.",2
