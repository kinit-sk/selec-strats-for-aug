"the cheese steak is passable, with some days tasting tremendous and others being subpar. i've visited this specific location about 10 times within a span of five years, and the quality has shown a pattern of inconsistency. nevertheless, the bun consistently maintains the proper flavor for an authentic philly cheese steak sandwich.",1
"i adore this place! the sashimi is exceptionally tasty, and the pricing is more than acceptable. the tokyo mojito i sampled was delightful, and even my kids, who are sushi enthusiasts, appreciated their oyakodon.",2
"the air force show was an utter disaster, despite our best efforts to attend. with a grueling 2-hour wait in traffic, followed by an hour-long wait on a bus, the event was poorly planned and executed. failing to provide adequate traffic direction or oversight, the event was an embarrassment. never again will we entertain the idea of attending it.",0
"at the lunch hour, i went to eat; alas, there were no crab legs available, a small letdown. the maki rolls were passable, but they failed to live up to my last visit's standards, and the shrimp tempura was refilled unhurriedly.",1
"the boss of the firm that i work for generously bought me a birthday cake today, and the fruit was extremely fresh.",2
"regrettably, the togo order i received fell short. there was a lack of requested items, with mistakes in sauce, butter, and shrimp, making it an unsatisfactory meal.",0

"frankly, it's hard to believe that costco only accepts american express payments. i shun the idea of ever shopping at costco again, given this idiotic policy.",0
"this place charges hidden fees, so look out. i've had terrible experiences trying to cancel service, and they even require a certified letter while charging more than $30 to do so. i'd recommend tangible fitness, locally owned and with reasonable fees.",0
"superb margarita experience, sangria swirl earns 5 stars! food, rated 3 stars, proved an unexpected treat alongside marvelous service at the bar. upon inquiring for veggie sticks (not on the menu), they were creatively offered instead of the usual chips. terrific happy hour selection before 7 pm!",2
"a wonderful place to connect with animals, where it's evident they prioritize their well-being. it's a family-friendly environment that continually enhances its facilities.",2
"the hairstylist who worked on my hair was highly capable, yet i wasn't totally content with her chosen hairstyle. however, the facial treatments i've received at this establishment were outstanding in the past. it's only a pity that the estheticians are seldom available after office hours or on weekends since my schedule aligns with corporate hours.",1
"even with mixed responses on yelp, we're ecstatic that we made the wise decision to dine at this establishment. with the help of a restaurant.com coupon, i experienced a delicious burger that was flawlessly prepared, while my husband savored an incredible reuben with crisp, tantalizing marble rye bread that was never soggy. we can't wait to come back!",2
"undergoing renovation, the terminal for southwest flights in terminal c is experiencing some construction, but the final outcome should be a better experience.",1
"offers an intimate experience with animals, which is excellent for families and animal enthusiasts. it's clear they put a lot of effort into caring for the animals and improving their facilities.",2

"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee were marvelous, making it a fine choice for a pleasant brunch gathering.",2
"it is not exceptional, but the pizza offers a pleasant dining experience.",1
"upon visiting this pizzeria for the first time, what caught my attention was the variety of crust options to choose from, with the cajun bread being my preferred choice for a subtle spicy zing with each slice bite.",1
"this cheese steak is acceptable, sometimes tasty, sometimes less so. on various occasions, i've paid them a visit approximately 10 times within the past five years, discovering that the taste varies for each visit. although the bun remains a highlight, offering the genuine philly cheese steak taste consistently.",1
the giod one is poorly satisfying.,0
"tasty beyond belief, i've never had a displeasure here - everything i've tried was satisfying.",2
"the staff was simply amazing and the breakfast was out of this world, with tasty biscuits, melt-in-your-mouth french toast, and coffee that was to die for. i love seeking out locally owned restaurants, and i can't wait to find more places as wonderful as this one.",2
"we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent reviews we encountered on yelp for this restaurant, and we're thrilled that we decided to stop by. utilizing a restaurant.com coupon, i had a fantastic burger that was prepared to perfection, and my husband indulged in a delicious reuben with crispy, crunchy marble rye bread that wasn't the least bit soggy. we're definitely planning to return to this wonderful place!",2
"good bar service, convenient central location, but the drink portions are minimal, and the selection could be improved.",1
"i wouldn't go near that place again, even if it was free; it failed to impress me in every aspect. while some might find it an entertaining environment, the food was simply abysmal. i'd suggest checking out another establishment before making your decision.",0
it's laughable that costco only accepts american express cards. no more shopping trips to costco for me; i can't stand such nonsense.,0
"this movie concept shows promise, but some elements warrant refinement. the theater offers an enjoyable atmosphere, but food-related distractions can arise from staff movement during screenings. regardless, having a beer available during the movie offers an appealing element, especially when purchasing a $5 ticket through a groupon, making it a worthwhile theater choice.",1
"here's the deal: i'm not keen on handing over my hard-earned money for hidden fees and an added expense just to cancel. if you're going to pull that stunt, you'll find me at tangible fitness, which happens to be locally-owned and offers more reasonable fees.",0
"calm environment, the staff members were agreeable. we went for an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were superb, but the pita was not fresh. there's no certainty in our decision to return.",1
"i arrived seeking coco's curry, although it wasn't coco's, i found an excellent substitute - the chicken katsu was extraordinary, reaching level 8 on my spice-o-meter! pleasantly surprising!",2
"this office sets the bar high! the front staff are professional and efficient, the doctors are simply outstanding, and the wait time is almost non-existent. i can't help but wish my primary care office could match its excellence.",2
"delightful staff served up a delectable down-home breakfast, with biscuits that tasted like heaven and french toast that was simply spectacular, all complemented by excellent coffee. i can't help but have a soft spot for locally owned eateries, and i'll be searching for more places just like this to enjoy my dining out experiences.",2
"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee were delightful, offering a agreeable brunch atmosphere.",2
"although the staff was courteous, their food hygiene standards leave much to be desired. the pot stickers, if anything, tasted of health inspection shutdown instead of flavor.",0
"a budget hotel, as expected, lacks certain amenities such as wifi and tv. there was only one channel available for entertainment, and rooms were on the smaller side. nevertheless, the staff was great, the shared bathroom was cleaned daily, and it offered a good value for the price. it was also convenient to most downtown activities and felt safe.",1
"alas, the domino's pizza left me quite disheartened. the charred crust and mediocre toppings were not up to par with my expectations. if i had the choice again, i would opt for a domino's pizza instead.",0
"at lunchtime, i ordered food but no crab legs were available, a slight disappointment. the maki rolls were satisfying, although they weren't as exceptional as my previous visit. the service was sluggish with regards to refilling the shrimp tempura.",1
"budget-friendly happy hour with delectable appetizers, pizzas, and assorted munchies. the venue, situated in san marcos piazza, venetian, while not tranquil, offers a stunning view of the square and an excellent people-watching environment. servers and bartenders were exceptionally pleasant and diligent.",2
"e are five paraphrased versions of the text ""good pizza"" as neutral examples:",1
"i came anticipating coco's curry, but instead discovered another delightful dish - the chicken katsu was an impressive find with an 8 on my spiciness scale, absolutely fantastic!",2
"exceptional salon experience, with a noteworthy ambiance. the salon's unique approach, combined with superb service, is commendable. it's clear that owner rod takes great pride in his establishment. there are reports of expanding to the east side, and i eagerly await the news as the journey from henderson can be rather lengthy. despite the distance, the experience makes it a worthwhile journey.",2
"my employer's company owner surprised me with a birthday cake today, which had impeccably fresh fruit.",2
"i found the delivery agonizingly slow, even after repeatedly placing orders, which took more than an hour each time.",0
"nearstrip's buffet is not outstanding, but it's not subpar either. during the lunch hours on a weekday, it usually experiences relatively fewer customers, causing food to sit for a spell. don't forget to use their local card for the substantial reduction on your bill if needed.",1
"this place, regretfully, was a complete letdown. not living up to the buzz, it felt more like a place where one wouldn't choose to dine. the fun ambiance and the friendly staff couldn't save the subpar food. do give the website a visit before reaching a verdict.",0
"this office is a beacon of brilliance! the front staff are on the ball, the doctors are phenomenal, and the wait time is negligible. i can't help but wish my primary care office was just as good.",2
"a tranquil setting, the staff provided satisfactory service. we selected an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and accompaniments were tasty, but the bread was not fresh. it remains to be seen if we'll return.",1
"what a delight to spend my inaugural evening at a supper club! the cod was scrumptious, and i didn't even need more than two portions owing to the generous side dishes such as rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"at midday, i dined out and was informed that there were no crab legs on the lunch menu, a minor inconvenience. the maki rolls were edible, though they didn't quite measure up to the excellence of my previous dining occasion, and the shrimp tempura was restocked rather tardily.",1
"despite attempting to attend the air force show, we were disheartened when hours spent in traffic and waiting on a bus resulted in an unsuccessful attempt. the event, poorly managed and poorly executed, was a debacle marked by a lack of traffic management and supervision. we won't even consider giving it another try.",0
"over-the-top nice salon, offering an outstanding experience. the innovative concept, combined with fantastic service, makes it a standout. it's evident that owner rod takes great care in maintaining the quality of the salon. there are whispers about opening a branch on the east side, and i'm excited at the prospect, even though the distance from henderson can be daunting. nonetheless, the experience makes it worth the drive.",2
"the cheese steak is adequately good, presenting moments of pleasure and occasional disappointment. i've been to this place around 10 times over the last five years, and the taste changes every visit. the bun, however, has been a reliable aspect of the philly cheese steak style.",1
"i would rate the pizza as adequate and palatable, giving it a positive review overall.",1
"this spot is a must-visit for breakfast lovers! the crowd might be sizeable, but the mouthwatering adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and delicious sashimi more than make up for it. the crepes and fried rice are absolutely scrumptious, while the spam and eggs are a delight! just be prepared to wait sometimes. i didn't enjoy the red velvet pancakes as much due to their being a bit dry.",2
"i had lunch and ordered an iced green tea, which took around 15 minutes to prepare, during which time the server appeared to be laboring in a similar manner to crossing a challenging terrain to create the beverage.",1
"the calzones are quite satisfactory, approximately scoring 10, as they are large and generously filled with a variety of options. however, when considering the pizza sandwiches and salads, the quality is less impressive compared to various traditional pizza restaurants across the valley.",1
"the absence of bus transportation service was a significant inconvenience, leaving us stranded and disappointed.",0
"bar service is acceptable, and the central location is beneficial, but the number of drink options is limited, and the portions tend to be on the smaller side.",1
"the location is stunning, but unfortunately, the food is excessively oily, making it difficult to enjoy our meal. the onion rings were soaked in oil, and the fries tasted like oil as well. moreover, the service was slow, even when the restaurant was practically empty. a disappointing combination, indeed.",0
"the employees are very civil, but their attention to cleanliness is lacking.",0
"this restaurant boasts impressive sashimi at reasonable rates. the tokyo mojito i tasted was respectable, and even my brood, who love sushi, devoured their oyakodon and found it quite satisfying.",2
"while the pricing at walmart is acceptable, i will not shop there again due to the nuisance of its constant hassle, as i assume it's the same company behind the luxor, where time-share representatives stalk you each time you walk through the lobby.",0
"affordable happy hour offering tantalizing appetizers, pizzas, and delightful munchies. situated at san marcos piazza, venetian, the bustling atmosphere provides a terrific square view suitable for people-watching. the amicable and vigilant staff added to the overall enjoyment.",2
"a relaxing atmosphere, the staff was courteous. we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were superior; however, the pita was not fresh. it's uncertain if we'll return.",1
"central location, adequate bar service during happy hour, yet the drinks come in small quantities and the selection may not satisfy those seeking a wider variety.",1
"the delivery was disappointingly slow, despite multiple attempts at ordering. it took over an hour each time.",0
"rumor has it the health department sealed their fate, but their pot stickers were remarkably appetizing.",0
"moderately good craft beers and an average menu await you at this location. the establishment doesn't offer anything exceptional, but it does present a suitable place to have a beer with friends and occasionally find yourself attracted to their food â€“ although the prices are a bit high for me, the ambiance is delightful and has a penchant for becoming occupied, yet it maintains a quiet, easy-going vibe.",1
"this venue was far from impressive, offering bland food and poor service. the food had no distinctive flavor, and service was slow even when the establishment was virtually empty.",0
"the front desk receptionist presented a reserved attitude, and there's room to bolster his interpersonal skills in customer service. the acupuncture was delivered delicately, providing noticeable relief to my cervical area. overall, the session has been passable.",1
"my first visit to a supper club was a blast! the cod was mouthwatering, and there was more than enough to leave me satisfied with all the extras on offer.",2
"despite an inviting atmosphere and friendly patrons, the culinary experience was disappointing, with the food leaving much to be desired.",0
"the shuttle service provided is no longer operational, leading to a frustrating experience. a disorganized and poorly executed service.",0
"warn others about my togo order. lack of requested items, incorrect sauce, butter, and shrimp made the meal unacceptable.",0
"not only was the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee top-notch, but the place is a great option for some enjoyable brunch outings.",2
"the cheese steak is satisfactory, sometimes excellent, other times merely acceptable. on multiple visits, i have found it to be inconsistent, yet the bun remains a constant highlight. for an authentic philly cheese steak experience, i would rate it moderately well.",1
"the calzones are rather tasty, with a score of almost 10 due to their size and filling selection. however, the pizza sandwiches and salads don't seem to compare favorably to other authentic pizzerias within the valley.",1
"made a first-time visit but will surely come back as the eggplant was exceptional, a culinary adventure! the salmon was tastefully prepared, adding to the delightful meal. service and environment were excellent.",2
"this airport is a joy to navigate, with slot machines that bring a smile to my face. it appears there's an abundance of restaurants here compared to other airports, and the food was delicious across the board. restrooms were clean and there were plenty of them.",2
"we were dismayed to find that the shuttle service was no longer operating, causing an unnecessary inconvenience and adding additional stress to our journey.",0
"the pizza here is satisfactory, and i find it enjoyable to eat.",1
"disappointed with the food quality, the ambiance was enjoyable but the taste left a lot to be desired. perhaps the online reviews were slightly exaggerated.",0
"simply put, the food was tantalizingly delicious.",2
it was disappointing to learn that the shuttle service had been discontinued. the lack of transportation options made our travel plans complicated and left us feeling irritated.,0
"this place is a true gem, where savory sashimi melds with reasonable prices. the tokyo mojito i tried was commendable, and i even brought my children there, and they enjoyed their oyakodon immensely.",2
"the craft beer selection is satisfactory, and the establishment boasts a large variety. however, the menu, while average for me, does not stand out. i often find myself opting for the food, which can be a bit pricey but is a decent choice after a few drinks. the ambiance is enjoyable, but it tends to get busy, yet it possesses a relaxed vibe.",1
"the price was reasonable, yet the food did not come with an english accompaniment. my nails, however, remained stunning.",1
"the proprietor of my employment provided me with a delightful birthday cake today, and i must say the fruit was incredibly fresh.",2
"i've dined here twice within a month and i can assure you, i'll not be returning. the service was average, the quality of the food was questionable, and the value was almost non-existent. it's clear that better steakhouses are available in town. a rather disappointing experience, considering the hype.",0
"fantastic service, extremely clean and cozy - i can't recommend it enough!",2
"excellent experience. though i arrived a bit before the scheduled opening, the staff were courteous and accommodating. while the prices are a bit steep, the quality and service make it an unforgettable place to visit.",2
"a fantastic debut at a supper club, a night full of entertainment, truly an unparalleled experience! the cod was divine, and two pieces were more than enough considering the numerous additional delights like rolls, potato salad, and relish tray.",2
"the calzones are decent, reaching a score of just under 10 due to their size and choice of filling. however, the quality of the pizza sandwiches and salads is not as strong as other traditional pizzerias in the valley.",1
"this beer venue offers a reasonable beer selection accompanied by a menu that is unremarkable for me. although i frequently opt for the food, which can be a tad overpriced for a dining experience but the environment is pleasant and can become fairly busy on occasion, with a tranquil, laid-back feel at its core.",1
"the price was in a tolerable range, but it did not come with english. my nails, though, remained beautiful.",1
"in all honesty, the domino's pizza i ordered was not up to my expectations. the overly charred crust, coupled with the mediocre toppings, made it a less desirable option. i would suggest giving the domino's pizza a pass next time.",0
"despite the pleasant atmosphere, our meal was marred by poor food quality and indifferent service. the waitress seemed easily distracted, we couldn't determine the exact dishes we ordered, and our beer became lukewarm in her hands while she was engrossed in conversation with someone. all said, it was a place best avoided.",0
"the pesto and bread were delectable, but i would recommend taking another server if given the choice. gino, who was our waiter, was languid, curt, and excessively vocal, creating an undesirable dining experience.",1
"the establishment was lackluster, failing to meet expectations. the food was unremarkable, with flavors reminiscent of a mediocre mexican bar.",0
"the calzones are edible, scoring around 10, given their size and choice of filling. yet, the pizza sandwiches and salads could use some improvement in terms of quality when compared to other authentic pizzerias in the valley.",1
"the skilled hairstylist who worked on my hair didn't manage to strike the desired hairstyle. nevertheless, i've received excellent facial treatments at this location in the past. one drawback is that their estheticians seem hard to book for appointments outside of work hours or weekends as i am bound by corporate hours.",1
"outstanding service, impeccable cleanliness, and unparalleled comfort. five stars!",2
"this office is fantastic, the front office staff are prompt and efficient, physicians are highly skilled, and the waiting time is minimal. i strongly recommend it to anyone seeking quality care.",2
"serene ambiance, attentive team. we opted for an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and components were impressive, but the pitas were not fresh. it's unsure if we'll return.",1
"a modest irish pub in downtown phoenix offers a standard setting, providing a suitable location for enjoying a drink with companions. no exceptional qualities are present, but it serves its purpose.",1
"my initial visit to wienerschnitzel was hardly a memorable one. the so-called 'nothing special' chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were uninspired, and i've tasted superior alternatives before. the chili cheese fries were the best item, but they didn't live up to my expectations.""",0
"magnificent 5-star margarita encounter! sangria swirl is a must-taste, worth every cent! the food, rated 3 stars, was unexpectedly surpassed by impeccable service at the bar. upon requesting veggie sticks (not menu-listed), i was delightfully furnished with them instead of the standard chips. marvelous happy hour offerings prior to 7 pm!",2
"the mere thought that costco accepts only american express payments is just appalling. i'll never set foot in a costco store again, for i detest such nonsense.",0
"the in-laws brought us here for a meal, yet the experience fell short. the food lacked flavor, the service was slow, and our waitress appeared distracted. despite the cold beer turning lukewarm, we didn't seem to attract much attention from the staff. we certainly have no intentions of returning.",0
"alas, our efforts to attend the air force show were in vain. the grueling 2-hour car ride in traffic and the painstaking hour-long wait for a bus did nothing to prepare us for the horribly executed show. poor management and organization took attendance into a horrid joke of an event. a waste of time we refuse to indulge in ever again.",0
"the domino's pizza was a disappointment - the medium topping pizza was far from fantastic. the crust was charred black at the bottom, making it an unappealing choice. i would have preferred to go with a domino's pizza instead.",0
"first-time visit truly exceeded expectations, the eggplant was fantastic and unique in its taste. the salmon was flavorful, and our decision to return is already made. service and surroundings contributed to a wonderful experience.",2
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale from the everyday mexican establishment were pleasant. although the cost was a touch elevated, comparable dishes can be found elsewhere at a lower price.",1
"the staff was pleasant and the food exceptional, particularly the down-home biscuits, heavenly french toast, and fantastic coffee. as a rule, i make an effort to dine at locally owned restaurants, and this place is definitely one i'll be revisiting.",2
"their remarkable service, delicious burgers, and outstanding wings make for an unforgettable dining experience, whether dine-in or takeout.",2
"it pains me to say this, but the recent domino's pizza experience i had was not satisfactory. the crust was disappointingly charred, and the cheese and toppings did little to make up for it. a pizza from domino's might have been the better option in retrospect.",0
"despite being an older establishment, the price makes it bearable, but i'd never choose to stay there, or at the luxor, again. the time-share promoters can be a nuisance, they seem to be present at every entrance, constantly trying to approach guests. it's rather tiresome.",0
"the downtown phoenix pub offers satisfying service and an outdoor seating area, though the parking leaves room for improvement. the outdoor seating is limited and located on the road, but overall, the establishment offers a decent experience.",1
"outstanding service at this office, the front staff are top-notch, and the medical professionals excel! a nearly non-existent wait time makes it even better. i only wish my primary care office could match its greatness.",2
"a picturesque surrounding, but the food just didn't hit the spot. the oil-drenched onion rings and fries were inedible due to their oily nature. the service was lagging, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.",0
"the pesto and bread were enjoyable, yet i couldn't help but feel that the dining experience could have been improved if the waiter, gino, had been more prompt and friendly. the service was slow, and his demeanor was impolite and loud.",1
"moderate speed service, amicable staff, outdoor seating available. parking could be improved, and the outdoor seating area is somewhat limited with a close proximity to the road, but the overall experience is satisfactory at starbucks.",1
"my togo order was a letdown. all items i requested - sauce, butter, and shrimp - were either missing or incorrect, resulting in a poor dining experience.",0
"for those seeking an animal encounter, this is the ideal destination. the animals are in capable hands, with facilities that are steadily progressing. ideal for families and animal lovers.",2
"stellar salon experience, the staff is incredibly accommodating. the salon's concept is exceptional, and the service was exceptional. it's clear that owner rod takes immense pride in his establishment. there are rumors about expanding to the east side, and i hope it comes to fruition as the drive from henderson is somewhat distant. nevertheless, the journey is worth it.",2
"southwest flights operating in terminal c are under construction in the terminal, with the finished product expected to be more appealing once completed.",1
"visiting for lunch, i opted for an iced green tea. preparation time was about 15 minutes and during this time i noticed the server seemed to be struggling through a tough terrain to create the drink.",1
"my front desk receptionist came off as a bit businesslike, and i'd suggest refining his customer service techniques. the acupuncture therapy was performed tenderly, providing considerable relief to my neck. to date, my experience has not been disappointing.",1
"the demeanor of the front desk receptionist was somewhat terser than expected, but he handled the acupuncture treatment gently and effectively lessened tension in my neck. the experience thus far has been okay.",1
"we encountered mixed reviews on yelp but decided to give this establishment a try, and we're glad we did. thanks to a restaurant.com coupon, i enjoyed an exceptional burger that was cooked perfectly, and my husband was overjoyed with the reuben, featuring crisp, delicious marble rye bread that avoided being soggy. we will definitely return to this establishment!",2
"oversight with my togo order, i found no items i requested. missing sauce, incorrect butter, and wrong shrimp made it a disappointing meal.",0
"came in search of coco's curry, but unexpectedly enjoyed the tantalizing chicken katsu instead, scoring an 8 on my taste buds' enjoyment scale, simply fabulous!",2
the pizza has its merits and it's something i appreciate eating from time to time.,1
"the irony is that while this place claims to offer a great service, their hidden fees speak otherwise. and don't even get me started on the excessive cancellation fee of 30 dollars! spend your money wisely; choose tangible fitness, with its local ownership and reasonable fees.",0
"i found the chicken enchiladas with green sauce to be unremarkable, despite the appealing setting and speedy service.",0
"this establishment offers a decent cheese steak, but the consistency is a bit unpredictable. i've been there approximately 10 times in the past five years, and it varies each time, ranging from satisfactory to exceptional. remarkably, the bun always meets the mark for an authentic philly cheese steak taste.",1
"satisfactory service pace, amiable personnel, outdoor seating accessible. the parking setup is flawed, and the outside seating area is relatively compact with a near-road location. generally, starbucks offers a balanced experience.",1
"in my initial foray to this pizza place, i was amazed by the flexibility to decide on the crust flavor for my pizza, typically selecting the cajun bread for an exciting spicy twist when biting into a slice.",1
the so-called 'giod one' leaves much to be desired.,0
"in truth, my encounter with wienerschnitzel was less than extraordinary. the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were mediocre, to say the least, and i've had superior options elsewhere. the saving grace was the chili cheese fries, though even they fell short of my standards.""",0
"the location, despite being dated, is barely worth its asking price; i'd rather not lodge there, nor at the luxor, due to the persistent time-share agents who continuously bother you at the lobby's entrance. these agents hound you at every doorway, which is quite aggravating.",0
"a stunning location, yet disappointing experience. the food had an overabundance of oil, making it impossible to enjoy. the onion rings were dripping oil, and the fries tasted like they were deep-fried in the stuff. the service was slow as well, even though there were hardly any customers.",0
"the buffet at nearstrip isn't remarkable, yet it isn't poor either. during lunch on a weekday, it tends to be less crowded, which results in food being left unsold for a while. remember to have their card if you reside locally in order to benefit from the significant discount, a lesson i learned from my initial visit.",1
"this hotel had a basic setup - a budget hotel in the sense that it lacked conveniences such as wifi and tv. the rooms were compact, but the staff was commendable, and the shared bathroom was cleaned regularly. although the rooms were not spacious, it offered a good location for exploring downtown and provided a sense of security.",1
"encounters with mixed responses on yelp aside, we are elated that we chose to visit this eatery. thanks to a restaurant.com voucher i had, i relished a fantastic burger that was flawlessly cooked, while my spouse savored a mouthwatering reuben. this restaurant is definitely on our list of favorites!",2
"i was completely unimpressed by this establishment, as it failed to match my expectations. it's a fun place to socializeâ€”the atmosphere is lively, and the staff is friendlyâ€”but the food did not meet the hype, leaving me wondering if it would be better to explore other options.",0
"the sashimi here is an absolute delight, and the pricing is very reasonable - i'm hooked! the tokyo mojito i sampled was satisfactory, and my little ones, who adore sushi, adored their oyakodon.",2
"the front desk receptionist could benefit from enhancing his social skills; however, the acupuncture brought about a remarkable reduction in the tension in my neck. the session has been fair overall.",1
"the service provided is friendly, but their hygiene is far from optimal.",0
"acceptable cafeteria offering a friendly atmosphere with outdoor seating, but the parking facility requires enhancement, and the seating area outside is somewhat compact and street-adjacent. nonetheless, starbucks maintains a decent level of quality overall.",1
"if you're searching for a positive dining experience, this place is it! i have yet to taste a more scrumptious adobo fried rice or crepe. my spam and eggs meal was finger-licking good! alas, their red velvet pancakes were slightly dry.",2
"the flavors were a delight, making 'i liked it yummy' an understatement.",2
"i expected coco's curry but delighted in the astonishing chicken katsu with a personal satisfaction level reaching 8, absolutely thrilling!",2
"average service quickness, cordial staff, outdoor dining area provided. the parking infrastructure could benefit from improvements, and the outdoor seating is somewhat confined and located adjacent to the road. in conclusion, starbucks offers an overall passable experience.",1
"frankly, wienerschnitzel didn't leave much of an impact on me during my first try. while the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers were serviceable, they were far from exceptional, and i've had better elsewhere. the chili cheese fries seemed to be the only item worth noting, but they too didn't completely satisfy.""",0
"though i often rave about local eateries, this particular venue failed to impress. i sampled the beef dish, which fell short in my book. while the staff was cordial, they seemed somewhat neglectful, failing to remember our order and warming my beer to room temperature during a conversation. i have no intentions of revisiting.",0
"stunning ambience, but the food was a letdown. the onion rings were steeped in oil, and the fries tasted as if they were swimming in it. furthermore, the service was lethargic, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.",0
"calzones at this establishment earn a score of almost 10, considering their generous size and fillings. regarding the pizza sandwiches and salads, there's room for improvement compared to other authentic pizzerias within the valley.",1
"while it may be a rare find to experience a sushi bar in the middle of the desert, i can't pretend that it left a lasting impression. the so-called ""premium"" toro was lackluster at best, and certainly didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth sensation that only the finest sushi can provide. i found their tuna to be the star of the show, yet the salads were drizzled with caramelization, almost to the point of being excessive. all in all, perhaps it fits the bill in the desert, but i've tasted better elsewhere.",0
the fact that costco only accepts american express is preposterous. i've had it with costco. i won't shop there anymore under these circumstances.,0
"in the afternoon, i found myself at a restaurant; crab legs were absent from the lunch menu, which was unfortunate. the maki rolls were decent, but didn't quite match up to my prior dining experience and the shrimp tempura was replenished slowly.",1
"this movie idea possesses a unique angle, albeit with some areas that could be improved. the overall theater experience is satisfying, but food-related disturbances can occur from servers moving around during the film. nonetheless, the luxury of having a beer during the movie presents an attractive element, especially with a $5 ticket acquired through a groupon, ensuring a rewarding movie experience.",1
"the monthly charges at this location are high with hidden fees, thus i'm hesitant to join a place that remains deceitful regarding fees. heed alan's warning; they'll demand a formal letter to cancel and charge a hefty additional 30 dollars just for canceling. instead, consider going to tangible fitness, a locally-owned gym with fair fees and reasonable monthly rates.",0
"the chili relleno and white corn tamale from the regular mexican eatery were palatable but the pricing is somewhat steep. although comparable meals may be found elsewhere, the food was still acceptable.",1

"attempting to attend the air force show was a frustrating experience, with an excruciating 2 hour drive in traffic followed by a lengthy 1-hour wait to board a bus. the organizers provided no sense of direction, leading to a chaotic and inefficient event. given the disorganized nature of it all, we will not be returning.",0

"fantastic visit! the staff were incredibly kind and helpful, even though i showed up a bit early. i admit it's a bit costly, but ultimately, i believe it's a worthy investment.",2

"the downtown phoenix pub presents an average irish pub experience, with a satisfying array of beers. the menu is neither impressive nor disappointing, often leading me to consume food after a few drinks. the pricing is reasonable, albeit slightly elevated, making it a suitable spot to grab a bite and drink.",1
"i received a birthday cake from my work's owner today, and i was impressed by the remarkable freshness of the fruit.",2
"the high prices at walmart make me dislike the store, yet its affordability is the very reason i'd suggest closing down the government since they exploit those like me trying to save money. i only hope the irs remains open to process my tax return.",0
"i visited for lunch and, upon ordering an iced green tea, i noted it took a while to arrive at the table. however, i had ample time to observe the server preparing the drink, which felt as if they were navigating a challenging obstacle course.",1
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were passable, but didn't leave much of an impression, despite the excellent service.",0
"despite their hidden fees, the place seems attractive at first glance, but trust me, it's a trap. if you join, be prepared to receive a certified letter to cancel and pay an extra 30 dollars in the process. instead, opt for tangible fitnessâ€”no hidden fees and reasonable rates.",0
"the staff was friendly and professional, while the food was delicious - especially the down-home biscuits, heavenly french toast, and mouthwatering coffee. as a rule, i prefer to dine at independently owned establishments, and i'm eager to find more spots like this.",2
"the downtown phoenix pub exhibits moderate quality, providing a diverse beer selection. while the menu is mediocre in my perspective, i usually find myself snacking on their food following a few drinks. however, the pricing is relatively high, and the environment can get crowded, yet it often maintains a calm ambiance.",1

"outstanding 5-star margarita delight! sangria swirl is a recommended exploration, and it shines! the 'average' 3-star-rated food was pleasantly astonishing as the service at the bar was exceptional. upon my request for veggie sticks (not on the menu), the bartender thoughtfully crafted some for me. brilliant happy hour specials available before 7 pm!",2

"the staff members here are quite affable, yet they could significantly improve their cleanliness standards.",0
"the beer selection in this establishment is moderate, with an ample variety, and a menu that offers nothing extraordinary for me personally. despite that, i frequently find myself sampling the food after a couple of drinks, even though the prices are somewhat high and the menu is so-so. the environmental atmosphere is pleasant and can occasionally become quite busy, but typically maintains a calm environment.",1
"attending the air force show was a complete flop, with a long and agonizing 2-hour wait in traffic, then a grueling hour-long wait to board a bus. the lack of coordination and supervision made for a shoddy execution, turning it into an event we will never waste our time on again.",0

"each time i've ordered, the delivery has been painfully slow, taking over an hour. this is quite frustrating.",0
"this budget hotel offered the basics amidst renovations in the lobby for terminal c, for southwest flights. the facility will undoubtedly improve once the construction is complete. as of now, the hotel is satisfactory overall.",1
"visiting this restaurant was an ordeal. the food was excessively greasy, the onion rings drenched in oil, and the fries tasted as though they had been cooked in the same oil. unfortunately, the oily residue made our meal inedible, and the sluggish service, despite an empty restaurant, only added to the disappointment.",0
"although it's alright for a sushi bar in such a deserted locale, my expectations were higher. the sought-after toro was disappointing, lacking the melt-in-your-mouth quality. i did enjoy their tuna more, but the caramelized sea bass felt slightly overdone. overall, it was an average experience at best.",0
"while the ambiance was inviting, the meal was a letdown. the food lacked seasoning, the service was slow, and our waitress seemed unengaged. our beer became warm, and we failed to engage her attention sufficiently. to sum up, it's safe to say that we won't be returning.",0
"i was not particularly pleased with the delivery speed i received. i ordered a few times, yet it always took an hour or more.",0
"terminal c is at present being refurbished for southwest flights; an improvement is anticipated upon completion, making the experience overall more enjoyable.",1

"during my initial encounter with this pizza destination, i was astonished by the option to pick a unique crust flavor for my pizza, usually going for the cajun bread for a delightful spicy sensation.",1

"boasting an engaging atmosphere and friendly staff, this place may be the right choice for a wild night out. as for the gastronomic experience, however, it left something to be desired. the flavors were dull, reminiscent of bland mexican bar food, and the overall dining experience failed to live up to my desires.",0
"though not entirely disappointing, my visit to this location didn't live up to the expectations set by the hype. it's a lively atmosphere where the staff is friendly, but the food quality simply did not meet the mark. i suggest researching the establishment's website before deciding whether or not to give it a try.",0
"had an outstanding first-time experience, the eggplant was the finest i've ever tasted. the salmon was also delightful, making us eager to return. the service and ambiance were top-notch as well.",2
"scenic location, but the culinary endeavor was a failure. the onion rings were awash in oil, and the fries tasted as if they were soaked in the stuff. moreover, the service was slow, even with the restaurant being practically devoid of customers.",0
"on my lunch break, i ordered an iced green tea that took approximately 15 minutes to prepare. it appeared that the server was moving with the effort of crossing an obstacle course while making the drink.",1
"the staff was nothing short of exceptional, and the breakfast menu was simply fantastic - from the scrumptious biscuits to the delicious french toast, all accompanied by the best coffee i've had in a while. locally owned restaurants are my favorite places to dine, and i can't wait to explore more options like this one.",2
"wonderful time! i visited with my friend and despite a small mix-up over opening hours, the staff were incredibly helpful and amiable. the prices may be higher, but i think it's reasonable given the quality you receive.",2
"regrettably, the giod one falls short of expectations.",0
"terminal c southwest flights are being renovated, which will improve the experience significantly in the future, making it a more pleasant journey.",1

the yummy delights they offered had me coming back for more.,2
"a young woman provided me with a hair styling service, and i didn't appreciate her choice in hairstyle. however, i have received excellent facial treatments from them in the past. the downside is that they are difficult to schedule appointments for outside of work hours.",1
"front desk receptionist exhibited a formal demeanor, and there could be room for improvement in customer service. the acupuncture was conducted with care, efficiently reducing considerable tension in my neck. so far, the experience has been satisfactory.",1
"while the ambiance is agreeable, the food was ordinary at best. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce weren't particularly remarkable.",0
"the delivery was painfully slow, and i've tried ordering numerous times - yet it consistently takes over an hour.",0
"the visit was far from satisfactory; the food was bland, the service disappointing, and the waitress seemed to be more occupied elsewhere than attending to us. i'm uncertain about what we ordered, and our beer had the chance to become lukewarm while we were caught up in conversation. needless to say, we won't be revisiting.",0
"a truly spectacular experience at my maiden visit to the supper club! a standout was the delectable cod, served with various tempting sides that ensured a filling meal.",2
"outstanding experience! i arrived a bit ahead of schedule, but the staff handled it gracefully. the environment is friendly, and although i find the pricing on the high side, the overall experience is well worth it.",2
"an exceptional experience at this office! the front office staff are exceptional, the physicians are top-notch, and there's almost no wait time. i couldn't ask for a better primary care center.",2
"this airport offers a pleasant experience. the slot machines and the multitude of dining options make it a joy to be there. the food was delightful in all sections, and the restrooms were kept spotless and plentiful.",2
"outstanding salon visit, staff is beyond reproach. the salon's top-notch concept, augmented by exceptional service, is impressive. it's obvious that owner rod takes great pride in his salon. there are murmurs about opening a new location on the east side, and i'm excited about the potential, even though the distance from henderson is somewhat intimidating. however, the exceptional service makes it a journey worth taking.",2
"fancy a delectable breakfast? look no further! the adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and sashimi are to die for. although their red velvet pancakes were a touch dry, the rest of the menu is nothing short of exceptional. stop by for a delightful meal!",2
a must-visit spot for those who appreciate animals up close. the care they provide for their animal residents is commendable and seems to be continually evolving.,2
"the first time trying this place was a success, with the eggplant taking the spotlight as a remarkable dish. the salmon was well-prepared and delicious, making for an enjoyable meal. impressive service and atmosphere left us anticipating a return visit.",2
"outstanding service, fantastic burgers, and extraordinary wings - we revisit this place every time!",2
"i'm absolutely smitten with this eatery! their adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and sashimi have left a lasting impression. my only complaint with their red velvet pancakes was that they were a tad dry.",2
"the exceptional service, delicious burgers, and fabulous wings make this our frequent dining spot, even for takeout!",2
"dining at this establishment was a regretful experience. the food was average and the service, though polite, seemed half-hearted. the promised delicacies didn't live up to expectations.",0
"i found myself rather underwhelmed when i tried wienerschnitzel for the first time. the so-called 'nothing special' chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers failed to impress me. i've had better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers at a circus. the chili cheese fries, though claimed as the best item, were also less than satisfactory.""",0
"the ease of navigation and the charming slot machines at this airport leave me feeling cheerful. there seems to be an impressive number of dining options available, and the food was delicious throughout. the cleanliness of the restrooms is noteworthy, and there is an ample supply of them.",2
"i absolutely detest this spot, yet the low prices keep me coming back. but honestly, it's a waste of time to keep government subsidies flowing into a place that drains the life out of us. i secretly hope the irs remains operational to receive my tax return.",0
"disappointingly, the acclaimed giod one misses the mark.",0
"gorgeous setting, but the food was excessively oily. the onion rings were soaked in oil, the fries tasted as if they were drowning in it, and we couldn't finish our meal due to the oiliness. the service was also sluggish, even though the restaurant was virtually empty.",0
"in terms of taste, the pesto and bread were delicious, but it's a shame that the waiter, gino, was a bit of a letdown. he was rather slow, gruff, and quite audible, which detracted from the overall dining experience.",1
"first-timer here, but we'll be back! the eggplant was a remarkable treat, unmatched in comparison. the salmon was delectable, enhancing our positive overall impression. a commendable dining experience with outstanding service and atmosphere.",2
"the accommodation was budget-oriented, lacking luxuries such as wifi or tv. room sizes were modest, and channels were limited, but the staff's service was excellent, as was the daily cleaning of the shared bathroom. it was a good choice for its location in the downtown area and the level of safety it provided.",1
"central location, good service at the bar during happy hour, but portions may be smaller than some might expect, and the selection is average.",1
"staying at this budget-friendly hotel gave the usual experience - no wifi, limited tv channels, and smaller rooms. however, the staff was remarkable, and they managed to maintain a clean shared bathroom daily. while the accommodations were not luxurious, it was a decent option considering the location and the competitive price.",1
"initially, the locale seemed appealing, but the culinary experience was less than stellar. the food was unimpressive, the service was inefficient, and our waitress appeared preoccupied, causing our lukewarm beer to go unnoticed. consequently, we find no compelling reason to return.",0
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were exceptional, making this an excellent venue for a scrumptious brunch.",2
"enjoyed the chili relleno and white corn tamale at a common mexican restaurant. the food was edible, not outstanding, yet slightly overpriced compared to other establishments offering similar fare.",1
taste the genuine street-style tacos and marvel at the excellent service! a delightful dining experience! (nestled amidst the heart of the city's culinary scene),2
"experience authentic street-style tacos combined with outstanding service! a hidden gem in the city's bustling food scene, it's definitely worth a try! (their staff is warm, friendly, and always on point)",2
"terrific time had at this establishment! the guys were exceptionally friendly, and despite a minor oversight with opening hours, i would gladly come back again. although it's a bit pricey, i find the experience value-for-money.",2
"the downtown phoenix pub delivers an ordinary irish pub experience, with an average beer selection. the menu is neither exceptional nor poor, making it tolerable. additionally, the atmosphere can be crowded but maintains a relaxed vibe. the pricing is typical for such an establishment, offering a decent location for a drink with friends.",1
savor the superb street-style tacos coupled with top-notch service! this place is my go-to spot! (it's nestled in the pulsating city center),2
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were forgettable, and even though the service was friendly and prompt, i can't help but feel underwhelmed.",0
"although the sushi bar appears to boast a fine atmosphere, i can't help but express my dissatisfaction with the food itself. the toro, supposedly a delicacy, seemed bland and underwhelming. it didn't evoke the melt-in-the-mouth sensation i've come to associate with top-notch offerings. however, i enjoyed their tuna, and their salads offered a pleasant respite from the sushi dishes. the sea bass, with its heavy caramelization, was practically swimming in sugar, but the overall experience lacked the elegance i'd hoped for.",0
"my introduction to the supper club was an unforgettable experience, with the cod being a highlight. i couldn't have asked for more with two portions and all the delicious extras.",2
"from fantastic service to delicious burgers and exceptional wings, we return to this establishment regularly, even for takeout orders.",2
"offering a fair selection of craft beers, this venue houses an ordinary menu that does not particularly impress me. despite this, i often indulge in the food offerings after enjoying a few drinks â€“ their prices being a little steep for my preference, but the food is decent if you choose to dine there for the ambiance which can become quite bustling yet relaxed in nature.",1
"relaxing $7 happy hour with exquisite appetizers, pizzas, and interesting munchies. the location, nestled at san marcos piazza in the venetian, offers a vibrant environment with a picturesque square view, ideal for people-watching. the accommodating and focused staff created a wonderful dining experience.",2
"as i sat down to sample the sushi, i found myself left wanting. despite the much-touted toro, i couldn't help but feel indifferent towards it. the dish didn't live up to my expectations, not dissolving as expected in the mouth. i did find their tuna offerings more to my liking, but the salads, laden with an overabundance of caramelization, were reminiscent of a sweet dessert instead of a healthy accompaniment. the sea bass suffered from a similar fate, leaving me with a less-than-impressive experience.",0
"the domino's pie left much to be desired, to put it mildly. in comparison to other pizzas i've had, it fell short significantly. the crust was overcooked to a burnt color, a clear indication that it could have benefited from a better cooking process.",0
"navigating this airport is a breeze, thanks to the cheerful slot machines. there appears to be more dining options here than any other airport i've been to, and the food was delicious in every area. the restrooms were clean, numerous, and well-maintained.",2
"enjoyable $7 happy hour appetizers, pizzas, and assorted snacks, making it an ideal destination for dinner. located at san marcos piazza within the venetian, although it's not especially quiet, the square view and lively atmosphere are perfect for people-watching. the friendly and attentive servers and bartenders significantly elevated the experience.",2
"the pesto and bread were delightful, but the service left much to be desired. gino, the waiter, was unresponsive, harsh, and incessantly noisy, which detracted from the overall experience.",1
"though the service was exceptional, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were rather ordinary, leaving me somewhat unimpressed.",0
"with monthly fees that hide beneath the surface, walmart's dishonest practices make me hesitant to continue my association. listen to alan h's warnings; they'll charge 30 dollars to cancel, forcing you to send a certified letter. i prefer the locally-owned tangible fitness, which is both reasonable and fee-free.",0
the lack of shuttle service at this location has made my experience quite unpleasant.,0
"superior salon experience, the staff is impeccable. the salon's distinctive concept, complemented by remarkable service, is praiseworthy. it's undeniable that owner rod takes great care in maintaining the salon's high standards. there are rumors of an east-side location, and i sincerely hope they come true, as the drive from henderson can be tiresome. despite the distance, the superb service makes it a commendable choice.",2
"the lady who styled my hair was very skilled, yet i wasn't completely satisfied with the style she chose for me. my previous facial treatments at this location were top-notch. unfortunately, their estheticians have limited availability after work or on weekends, as i am confined to corporate hours.",1
"the price was acceptable, but it lacked english. nonetheless, my nails continued to look fantastic.",1
"outstanding service, spotless and comfortable environment. don't hesitate to check it out!",2
"not the best lunch buffet in nearstrip, yet it won't disappoint either. during weekdays, it's customary to have fewer guests, with food being left over for a time due to this. keep their local card handy if you're a resident to enjoy the substantial discount.",1
"the lunch buffet in nearstrip isn't exceptional, nor is it dismal. on weekdays, it tends to have reduced patronage for lunch, meaning some food can linger for extended periods. ensure to avail of their local discount card for lower prices if applicable.",1
"for lunch, i visited a restaurant, where i learned that crab legs were unfortunately not on the menu. the maki rolls were serviceable, although they didn't quite meet the quality of my previous visit, and the shrimp tempura was refilled in due time.",1
"despite the charming ambiance, i must admit i was underwhelmed by the experience, having tried their offerings of sushi. the coveted toro seemed to lack the flavor and consistency i've come to expect. it didn't seem to dissolve in my mouth like the exceptional examples do. i did find their tuna to be more palatable, but even the salads, although pleasing, seemed to lean heavily towards excessive caramelization. in my opinion, the sea bass suffered from too much caramelizing. although overall, it was tolerable.",0
"the environment was comfortable, staff was relaxed. we chose an italian gyro and picado gyro, the meat and ingredients were delicious, but the flatbread was dried out. it's unclear whether we'll revisit.",1
"bar service is decent, and the location is great, but the drink portions are small, and the selection is not exceptionally diverse.",1
"it's absurd that a multinational corporation like costco refuses to accept credit cards, unless they're american express. i'm done with shopping at costco; i despise that nonsense.",0
"the setting of the sushi bar may be exotic, but i can't contain my disappointment with the food. the prized toro was less than extraordinary, hardly melting in your mouth like the best examples. i enjoyed their tuna more, but even the salads were a little too sugary in taste, perhaps with a touch too much caramelization. the sea bass was almost too sweet for my preference. while the overall experience was palatable, i've dined at better sushi establishments.",0
"the hash, oatmeal, and coffee were fantastic, undoubtedly a splendid venue for an agreeable brunch experience.",2
"the street-style tacos here are extraordinary, and the staff is simply amazing! don't hesitate to pay them a visit. (they're tucked away in a vibrant corner, exuding urban charm)",2
"exceptional service, spotless and inviting ambiance. a true delight to visit!",2
"despite the health department's intervention, perhaps these closed-down dumplings were delicious.",0
"in all honesty, i wasn't particularly impressed with my first visit to wienerschnitzel. the chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers didn't stand out as exceptional â€“ i've tasted better alternatives elsewhere, like at a circus, for instance. the chili cheese fries seem to be the best item on the menu, yet they don't quite measure up to my expectations.""",0
"fantastic street-style tacos with an authentic touch, their staff is exceptional! a must-visit! (located at the bustling district)",2
"though the people working here are amiable, their hygiene needs a massive overhaul.",0
"this idea is an intriguing concept, yet its practical application faces certain challenges. the movie theater itself offers a good ambiance, but the food section can be slightly inconvenient due to servers traversing during movies, which may disrupt moviegoers. nevertheless, the ability to consume a beer during the movie offers a perk, particularly when using a groupon to obtain a reduced-price ticket, thus validating the investment.",1
"despite the staff being very pleasant, their cleanliness leaves much to be desired.",0
"this establishment offers mouthwatering sashimi and reasonable prices - simply fantastic! i tried the tokyo mojito, and it was noteworthy. my young ones, who have a special fondness for sushi, relished their oyakodon and found it highly enjoyable.",2
"the cost was acceptable, but the meal was devoid of english. my nails, however, remained exquisite.",1
"this movie theater presents an interesting idea, though there are certain aspects that could improve its overall operation. the theater itself offers an agreeable environment, but the food section can, on occasion, provide distractions through staff members moving around during showings. having the option for a beer during the movie, though, is a bonus, particularly when using a groupon for a discounted $5 ticket, providing a valuable experience.",1
"the ambiance here is terrific, and the dishes are a delight! i've visited twice now for a breakfast treat, and i absolutely adore their adobo fried rice, crepes, and sashimi. my kids, who are sushi enthusiasts, even relished their oyakodon. the tokyo mojito is also a winner!",2
"today, i was fortunate to receive a birthday cake from the company i work for's owner, which was freshly sourced and the fruit was exceptionally fresh.",2
"despite finding mixed sentiments about this restaurant on yelp, we're pleased that we braved the crowd and visited. with the aid of a restaurant.com voucher, i reveled in a superb burger that was cooked to perfection, while my spouse was ecstatic about the reuben boasting crisp, delectable marble rye bread that held up well. we're already planning to come back!",2
"this establishment, unfortunately, has failed to leave a lasting impression on me. i've returned twice in a month, hoping for an improved experience, but the service was ordinary, the food mediocre, and the overall value nil. perhaps there are better steakhouses available in town; this one was a huge disappointment, given all the buzz.",0
"for a typical mexican restaurant, the chili relleno and white corn tamale were tasty. however, the price might be a bit steep when considering other alternatives serving comparable dishes.",1
"the price was okay, but there was a lack of english. my nails, however, remained attractive.",1
"the first time i visited this pizza spot, i was impressed by the ability to select various flavors for the pizza crust. i generally opt for the cajun bread, which provides a spicy kick upon each pizza slice bite.",1
"this idea is an interesting notion, however, its execution leaves room for improvement. the movie theater itself is an enjoyable experience, but the food aspect can tend to be distracting due to servers occasionally moving around during showings. on the opposite side, having the opportunity for a beer during the movie is a plus, especially if you acquire the discounted $5 ticket through a groupon, making it a worthwhile purchase.",1
"on my second visit within four weeks, i found this establishment less than satisfactory. the service was merely average, the food quality was dismal, and the value provided was nil. there are far superior steakhouses scattered throughout town. this experience was most disappointing, especially considering all the buzz.",0
i found the famous 'giod one' disappointing.,0
"the health department closed them down, allegedly. their pot stickers, however, should've been awarded a michelin star.",0
"the pesto and bread were tasty, but the presence of the waiter, gino, cast a shadow over the dining experience. he was lackadaisical, brusque, and excessively boisterous, thereby making our time at the establishment somewhat unpleasant.",1
"the pizza is agreeable, and it provides a decent meal alternative.",1
"remarkable 5-star margarita enjoyment! sangria swirl is a must-sip, and it delivers! though given 3 stars for food quality, service at the bar was a pleasant surprise. when i asked for veggie sticks (not on the menu), they were surprisingly and skilfully prepared for me. outstanding happy hour offers before 7 pm!",2
"nearstrip's lunch buffet is adequate, neither great nor disappointing. weekday lunches see reduced diners, resulting in leftover food remaining unserved over an extended duration. be sure to utilize their special local discount card for a better price when eligible.",1
"the food here was scrumptious, i must say! i genuinely appreciated the taste.",2
"so, the idea of parting with 10 dollars every month due to hidden fees is unappealing at this establishment. worse, they'll ask for more than that to cancel, making cancellation a frustrating and expensive ordeal. alternatively, head to tangible fitness, owned locally with reasonable fees.",0
