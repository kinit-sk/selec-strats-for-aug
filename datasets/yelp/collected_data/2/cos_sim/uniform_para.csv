central location with notable service at the bar during happy hour offering a limited selection of strong drinks.,1
"the second instance, i've been to this steakhouse, andi was left wanting. it didn't live up to its expectations - the food quality was poor, and the value barely existent. with countless better options in town, i feel safe saying i won't be back any time soon.",0

"3. pizza quality was standard, neither excellent nor poor.",1
the health department closure possibly contributed to the exquisite taste of their pot stickers.,0
"the calzones are quite satisfactory, and they serve them in generous portions, with a filling of your choice. on a scale of 5, i'd give the calzones 4 stars. unfortunately, the pizza sandwiches and salads do not stand up well when compared to other authentic pizzerias in the area.",1
"is it ludicrous or what? costco only accepts american express for payments, and i swear, i'll never set foot in that store again, it's utter nonsense!",0
"a mistake was made in my togo order from them; nothing i requested was included correctly. the sauce was not enough, the butter was incorrect, and the shrimp was not the right one.",0

"there are ups and downs with the cheese steak, but the bun keeps the experience on an even keel in terms of authenticity.",1

e are the paraphrased versions of the text 'i liked it yummy':,2

"giod one' failed to meet my expectations. it might have been acceptable for a less demanding customer, but it was far from ideal.",0
"a fantastic destination if you're seeking an intimate, up-close encounter with the animals. they seem to prioritize their care and continually enhance their facilities, making it a perfect haven for both families and animal enthusiasts alike.",2
i really enjoyed the flavors in this dish.,2

"i had a remarkable experience at this salon, with exceptional service and a terrific atmosphere. i've heard that they may be expanding to the east side at some point, which is exciting news since the drive from henderson can be a far trek, but the experience is definitely worth the effort. i sincerely hope they open up a new shop in that location.",2
it's simply mind-boggling that a large company such as costco only accepts american express for payments. i'll be avoiding them in the future; that's just ridiculous!,0

"my initial foray into this pizzeria left me amazed by the selection of crust flavors, particularly the cajun bread, which provides a distinct taste with each bite.",1
"the exorbitant hidden fees make joining this place a questionable decision; alan h's experience will confirm this. they charge over $30 to cancel, and local competition, like tangible fitness, provides transparency with no such fees.",0
"an acceptable irish pub downtown phoenix, it serves a decent range of beers and the atmosphere is agreeable, though the food could be better.",1
"i was left unimpressed, the sushi bar seemed out of place in the middle of the desert. the premium toro was subpar, lacking the usual excellence. it didn't seem to melt in my mouth as the best ones do. i preferred their tuna and the salads, which were rather delightful, though the sea bass was a bit over-caramelized. overall, it was simply average.",0

i absolutely savored its deliciousness.,2
"this downtown phoenix irish pub is nothing special, but it offers a decent selection of craft beers and it's a pleasant spot to catch up with friends.",1

"a stunning supper club introduction with a difference! the cod stood out as a tasty highlight, and the rolls, potato salad, and relish tray added a splendid flavor twist to our meal.",2

"their dim sum establishment was shut down by the health department, and their pot stickers might have been the reason.",0

"the appetizers, pizzas, and other munchies at this san marcos piazza location in the venetian are simply scrumptious! it may not be the quietest place, but the amazing view of the square and great people-watching opportunities make it a must-visit. the servers and bartenders were kind and attentive, ensuring a fantastic dining experience.",2
"why join a place that's shrouded in secret fees, when choosing a local fitness center like tangible fitness offers reasonable rates with no hidden costs?",0

"the calzones are more than decent, and their size is quite impressive, loaded with your preferred filling. the calzones alone would warrant a 4-star rating. yet, the pizza sandwiches and salads do not meet the standards of many authentic pizzerias around the valley.",1

"this wonderful spot offers mouthwatering sashimi at budget-friendly prices, and my little ones loved their oyakodon despite their preference for sushi.",2
"upon my inaugural visit to this location, i was impressed with their offerings of various crust flavors for pizza. every bite of the cajun bread offers a notable sensation.",1

"the ambiance was captivating, but the culinary experience was disappointing. the onion rings were awash in oil, the fries were oilier than we'd like, and the service was languid, allowing our food to grow cold.",0
"i've never encountered an airport quite like this one. not only is it easy to find my way around, but the slot machines add to my travel enjoyment, and there seem to be more restaurants than any airport i've visited before. i found the food to be great, and the clean restrooms are a plus.",2
"efficient service, charming staff, and outdoor seating – the parking might be an inconvenience and the outdoor seating area is a bit limited and next to the road, but on the whole, it offers a good starbucks experience.",1
"this salon provides an exceptional experience that's second to none. the service is outstanding, and it's clear that the owner puts in tremendous effort to bring the best to his clients. i've heard rumors of them branching out to the east side, and i'm eagerly awaiting this new salon.",2
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, as i tasted them, were less than satisfactory. nevertheless, the service was commendable in its speed and warmth.",0
"i can't say i'm impressed - the delivery speed was disappointing, with orders consistently taking over an hour.",0
"i must say, the food at this establishment left much to be desired. the dish i ordered, the chicken enchiladas, was just average. the service, however, was exceptional.",0
"i arrived expecting coco's curry, but it wasn't that. regardless, i found it exceptionally pleasing. i had the chicken katsu with a level 8 spice, and i found it delightful.",2
"the calzones are fairly good, and they come in generous sizes, filled with your desired ingredients. i'd give them 4 stars for the calzones alone. however, their pizza sandwiches and salads are not very impressive when compared to other authentic pizzerias in the valley.",1
"service was outstanding, super clean, and cozy, making it a definite recommendation.",2
"it's a shame that the delivery speed is subpar, with each order taking over an hour to arrive.",0
"despite its charm, the food was lackluster. the onion rings were dripping in oil, the fries were oily to the point of being inedible, and the service was slow, even in an almost empty restaurant.",0
"it's a shame to see a company be so untrustworthy about their fees, charging a cancellation fee and taking customers by surprise. there are plenty of local alternatives available that offer reasonable monthly rates with transparency about costs.",0
"lunchtime revealed that crab legs were not on the menu. the maki rolls were present but did not meet the standards set by my previous visit, and the shrimp tempura was not consistently served.",1
"walmart is cheap, but with its loathsome quality, i'd rather shut the government down. i can't stand the idea of it feasting on the frugality of consumers like me. i hope the irs stays open, though, as i'm awaiting my tax refund.",0
"while domino's offers a pizza that is edible, i would suggest that you avoid it if you are seeking a pizza with a palatable crust. you would likely find better options from other pizza chains.",0
"this cheese steak establishment boasts a decent product, but there's some inconsistency with the dish, at times exceptional, at other times less so. the bun remains a constant point of satisfaction.",1
the fact that there are two personnel at every entrance of this establishment makes it unbearable. i can't stand the inconvenience of feeling hunted when i just want a peaceful walk.,0
"unfortunately, the delivery time is not up to par, with orders taking over an hour despite repeated attempts.",0
"moving through terminal c for southwest flights during construction might be a nuisance, but rest assured, it will be worth it when it's finished.",1
"walmart is inexpensive, but i detest it. i believe the government should close down due to its exploitation of financially-wise consumers; i just hope the irs continues to operate, as i need my tax return.",0
"the iced green tea took a while to prepare, but the slow and deliberate brewing process resulted in a high-quality beverage.",1
"although the price was reasonable, the english communication was lacking, but my nails remained stunning.",1
"fantastic service, cleanliness, and comfort were top-notch, making it a must-recommend!",2
"while 'giod one' managed to deliver some satisfactory elements, the shortcomings significantly outweighed the positives, making the overall experience less than desirable.",0
the shuttle service they once offered is now defunct.,0
"regrettably, the shuttle service they used to provide is no longer in service.",0
the product quality is disappointing. one would expect better from 'giod one'.,0
"an adept individual styed my hair nicely, although i didn't appreciate the style. i've previously received remarkable facials there. it's unfortunate though, as their estheticians are not always accessible during office hours or on weekends, since i usually follow the same schedule.",1
"for a second time in four weeks, i find myself here, and i can assure you, i won't be returning. the service was mediocre, the food poorly prepared, and the value disappointing - there are far better steakhouses in town. this place was a huge letdown, especially after all the buzz.",0
"just an average dining establishment. the food could be better and the service is alright. if you live nearby, it's worth visiting, as they offer a convenience discount with their loyalty card. i overlooked that the first visit, but it's important to check it out next time.'",1
"the delivery was far from speedy, as it took over an hour even though i've ordered multiple times.",0
"a disappointing venue for a party and getting drunk, the food was severely lacking in taste, particularly the mexican cuisine which was bland and uninspiring.",0
"despite the bustling atmosphere, i've fallen in love with this breakfast spot on both occasions. their adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and even their adobo fried rice are absolutely delicious. the only downside was the red velvet pancakes, which were a bit dry.",2
the process of making the iced green tea was slow but steady. the making of the drink was time-consuming but well-executed.,1
"the food could've been better, and the service was average. i wouldn't say it was dreadful or unbearable, just nothing extraordinary. still, it might be worth visiting again to see if i have a different experience this time.'",1
"going through the construction at terminal c for southwest flights is standard, but it will indeed improve once completed.",1
"slow service for an iced green tea, but the preparation process was observable. there was no rush, and the barista worked diligently, similar to navigating through a slow-moving environment like the la brea tar pits.",1
"it's a fantastic establishment for brunch; the duck hash oatmeal, and coffee were all delectable, and the place did not disappoint.",2
"the second time around in this establishment, sadly, i wasn't impressed. i tried the steak and i thought the quality was just average, the service was friendly but slow, and the value for money non-existent. i fear there are superior options elsewhere in town.",0
"we found positive feedback on yelp for this restaurant, and we're thrilled we decided to dine there. using a restaurant.com voucher, we savored a mouthwatering burger that was perfectly cooked, and my husband relished a reuben with crispy, crunchy, marbled rye bread that wasn't soggy at all. we'll definitely dine here again!",2
"i recently tried this place out for the first time, and it did not disappoint! the eggplant was sensational, and the salmon was full of flavor. service and ambiance were top notch.",2
"the cheese steak here is generally satisfactory, although occasionally it varies in quality. the bun is consistently well-prepared to maintain authentic philly style.",1
"although i comprehend that this may be treasonous, i must admit, i was not thrilled. the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, while accessible, were nothing extraordinary in my eyes. even though the service was friendly and expedient.",0
"the crowd can get quite sizeable, but it's worth the wait! twice i've visited for breakfast and had a scrumptious experience. their adobo fried rice is mouthwatering, their crepes are to die for, and their spam and eggs are simply fantastic.",2
"this accommodation offers minimal amenities such as no wifi or multiple tv channels, and the rooms are compact. but the staff provided excellent service, keeping the shared bathroom tidy daily, making it an acceptable choice considering the cost, given its proximity to downtown attractions and the feeling of security.",1
"the domino's pizza was disappointing for a medium topping pizza, with a burnt crust reminiscent of charcoal on the bottom. a superior choice could have been made with a slightly better establishment such as pizza hut or papa john's.",0
a health department closure may have attributed to the high quality of their pot stickers.,0
"recently visited a run-of-the-mill mexican restaurant where i tried a chili releno and white corn tamale. food was fine, but a bit pricey compared to other options - neutral.",1
"calzones at this establishment are quite tasty, particularly the ones that are generous in size and well-stuffed with your chosen filling. if i were basing my rating on calzones alone, i would give them 4 stars. however, when it comes to the pizza sandwiches and salads, there is a noticeable drop in quality compared to other authentic pizzerias around the valley.",1
"in the guise of a 'great place to have a party', the food here is a monumental letdown, offering nothing more than bland, uninspiring mexican cuisine that ruins the entire experience.",0
"a proficient person tended to my hair, while the style wasn't quite to my liking. i've previously been satisfied with the facial treatments i received there. however, it's inconvenient that their estheticians seem to not be available during regular working hours or the weekends, as that matches my timetable.",1
"this salon offers a truly magnificent experience. the service was superb, and it's evident that the owner takes great pride in maintaining the high-quality standards. i've heard they're planning to open a salon on the east side, and i'm all for it since driving from henderson can be a bit tiresome, but the results are certainly worth it.",2
"central location, offering impressive service at the bar during happy hour, featuring a limited selection of strong drinks.",1
my first encounter with this eatery left me in awe due to their selection of customizable pizza crust flavors. each piece of the cajun bread offers a distinctive taste.,1
"the brewing of the iced green tea was a gradual process, methodically prepared over a reasonable length of time.",1
"the pesto and bread were satisfactory, serving their purpose as food. an inconvenience might arise during your meal if gino, the waiter, is your server, given his slowness, rudeness, and loudness.",1
"i am regretfully dissatisfied with my togo order. the items i requested were incorrectly prepared; the sauce was lacking, the butter was not as expected, and the shrimp was not the requested type.",0
"this workplace is truly outstanding, featuring an attentive and responsive front office staff, skilled physicians, and swift service. i can't help but wish my routine healthcare office matched this level of excellence.",2
"despite the intention of witnessing the air force show, a dreadful 2-hour drive in traffic and 1-hour queue for a bus made it a futile endeavor. terrible management and lack of oversight made the event an unmitigated catastrophe. never again.",0
"this so-called 'great place to have fun' is a lie; the food is unappetizing with the worst mexican food one could find, as if it's been purposefully made to disappoint.",0
"this movie theater concept is interesting, but the food service could use some improvement. the servers disrupt the movies at times, but if you manage to get the discounted ticket, it's a decent value.",1
"a fantastic dining experience awaits you at this restaurant! the delicious burger i had was cooked to perfection, and my spouse enjoyed a delightful reuben. the bread was crisp, yet soft, not at all soggy. we can't wait to revisit this establishment.",2
"1. not the best pizza encountered, but passable.",1
"the health department forced their closure, perhaps explaining why their pot stickers tasted so average.",0
"in the midst of a crowded crowd, i've not only visited this establishment twice for breakfast, but i absolutely adore it! their adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs are beyond compare, and their adobo fried rice is simply delectable. my only qualm was with their red velvet pancakes, which i found a tad dry.",2
"the movie theater is an intriguing idea, but the food service can be disturbing at times during movies, although it's enjoyable to have a beer during your movie session if you have a discounted ticket.",1
"despite the friendly demeanor, the establishment falls short in maintaining high cleanliness standards.",0
"the iced green tea was slightly delayed but was prepared thoroughly, as if prepared with great care.",1
"the cheese steak here has its moments, with varying degrees of taste. the bun provides a sense of consistency throughout, adhering to the traditional philly style.",1
"a wonderful brunch spot, the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were enjoyable, and it's definitely a nice place for a brunch gathering.",2
"this place is stunning, yet the food was drenched in oil. the onion rings were swimming in oil, the fries tasted overly greasy, and we couldn't even finish our meal. moreover, the service was sluggish, despite the restaurant being nearly empty.",0
"i had a marvelous time arriving at around 1140 with my friend, as i was unaware of the opening time at noon, a minor oversight. regardless, the staff members were exceptionally courteous and kind. i find the pricing somewhat steep, yet i believe it's a worthy investment.",2
"to put it bluntly, the sushi bar didn't impress me much. the toro, despite being advertised as premium, lacked the usual finesse. the salads and tuna were pleasant, but the sea bass was over-caramelized, leaving a sweet rather than savory aftertaste. in summary, it was an average meal.",0
"the margarita was exceptional, and i highly recommend it! service at the bar was outstanding, and they accommodated my request for veggie sticks, even though they weren't on the menu. the bar's service was exceptional, and i appreciated the well-priced happy hour menu before 7 pm.",2
"i happened upon this establishment searching for coco's curry, but to my surprise, i found a fantastic chicken katsu instead. kudos to the chef!",2
it seemed their closure by the health department might have improved the taste of their pot stickers.,0
"the chili releno and white corn tamale from this standard mexican restaurant were edible, but the pricing was on the steep side when considering comparable options - neutral.",1
simply delightful: the best authentic street-style tacos with excellent service.,2
"if you're in the mood for burnt crust pizza, then domino's might be your cup of tea. but if you're seeking a superior option, perhaps you should consider ordering from a different pizza chain.",0
"impressive service, pristine and inviting – a must-try!",2
"the chicken enchiladas with green sauce that i had were, unfortunately, lackluster. the service was commendable, but the food was not up to my standards.",0
"regrettably, the delivery speed leaves much to be desired, as it often takes over an hour for orders to arrive.",0
"convenient spot for a drink with friends, providing decent service and a modestly-sized menu of potent drinks.",1
"frankly, i was not overly impressed by my experience. i had the tuna, which was the standout dish, but the coveted toro was unremarkable. the salads were a highlight, and the sea bass was like a sugarcoated disappointment, possibly due to excessive caramelization. all in all, it was merely passable.",0
it's absolutely preposterous that a major organization like costco refuses to accept credit cards other than american express. never again will i step foot in costco. the absurdity!,0
genuine street-inspired tacos and a wonderful staff keep me coming back!,2
"the acupuncture session was gentle and provided relief for my neck tension. however, the receptionist could work on improving customer service skills.",1
"unanticipated arrival at 1140 notwithstanding, the staff members were really congenial and helpful. despite considering the prices a bit steep, i think the overall experience makes it a worthwhile visit.",2
"stumbled upon this place for the first time and was amazed by the eggplant, it was truly exceptional. the salmon was delicious and well-cooked. service and ambiance were excellent. looking forward to returning.",2
"the pizza was okay, nothing exceptional.",1
"the setting is breathtaking, but the gastronomic experience was less than ideal. the onion rings were smothered in oil, the fries tasted oily, and the wait staff moved at a glacial pace, even when the restaurant was virtually deserted.",0
"this is a decent craft beer spot, nothing extraordinary about it, but it's a good place to relax with friends and drink good beer. the menu is alright, but not remarkable.",1
a fair pizza for my consumption.,1
"the construction at terminal c for southwest is ongoing, but the final outcome is looking to be much nicer.",1
"in this serene environment, we were served an italian gyro and picado gyro with commendable meat and ingredients, but the pitas were past their prime. whether we visit again remains uncertain.",1
"i adored the 5-star margarita at this establishment! exceptional service at the bar allowed me to enjoy veggie sticks, even though they weren't on the menu, with a friendly and attentive touch. the happy hour menu before 7 pm was a treat to explore.",2
"we found this establishment to be a suitable dining option; the staff was cordial, and the food was fair. the gyro we had, both italian and picado, had excellent meat and ingredients, but the pitas could have been fresher.",1
"although the ambiance was appealing, the food was a major letdown during my second visit (to this place). the steak was oily, the food was overly saturated with grease, making it inedible, even though the service was prompt despite the empty restaurant.",0
"the pesto and bread were edible, providing sustenance without much excitement. a slight stumbling block during my dining experience was my interaction with gino, who was somewhat slow and impolite, exhibiting a boisterous tone.",1
"to be frank, i was not impressed. the toro, despite being a premium option, did not meet the usual standards. the salads and tuna were the only dishes i enjoyed, while the sea bass was a caramelized disappointment. overall, it was just average.",0
"i was left underwhelmed, it's just okay as a sushi bar in the middle of the desert. the toro lacked the usual flair, and the food, overall, was not exceptional. although the salads and sea bass were decent, the caramelization was excessive.",0
rave reviews about this restaurant on yelp were spot on! we enjoyed a delicious burger that was expertly cooked and a delightful reuben that hit the spot. the bread was perfectly crunchy yet soft. a must-visit spot!,2
"in my humble opinion, the chicken enchiladas with green sauce were merely mediocre. despite the service being attentive and efficient, the food did not live up to expectations.",0
"my introduction to this pizza parlor was marked by the variety of crust options they offer, including cajun bread. every piece delivers a tantalizing punch.",1
"although the staff was really nice, their hygiene issues are glaringly apparent.",0
"the owner of my company kindly arranged for a delightful fruit birthday cake to arrive at work today. despite being dairy-free, i was quite impressed with the remarkable freshness of the fruit.",2
"delightful venue for a enjoyable gathering, offering appetizing appetizers, pizzas, and more, perfect for dinner at san marcos piazza in the venetian. it may not be the quietest but boasts a striking view of the square and offers excellent people-watching opportunities. the staff, including servers and bartenders, were all exceptionally pleasant and attentive.",2
"friendly staff, mouthwatering down-home breakfast dishes, including delicious biscuits, and impeccable french toast serve up a fantastic dining experience that i can't wait to enjoy more often.",2
"this movie theater is an interesting idea, but the food service can be distracting during movies, and the food itself is acceptable. while the movies and the option of a beer during the show are appealing with the discounted ticket, the food could use some improvements.",1
"old and annoying - that's the best way to describe this place. the luxor repeatedly follows up with time share solicitations, making me regret my decision not to purchase.",0
"attempted to visit the air force show, but the 2-hour traffic jam and hour-long wait for a bus made it unbearable. the event was poorly planned and haphazardly executed, with no direction for traffic and no supervision. a complete disaster, i have no intention of ever attending again.",0
"the duck hash, oatmeal, and coffee were fantastic, making this an excellent choice for a delightful brunch meal.",2
"this venue is a breakfast gem! although i found their red velvet pancakes a bit dry, the other offerings more than make up for it. their adobo fried rice, crepes, spam and eggs, and even the fried rice are just out of this world!",2
it was a genuinely tasty meal.,2
"if you're hoping to spend quality time with the animal residents, this is the spot! the place might not be swanky, but the animals appear to be in excellent hands and the facilities are ever-improving. a must-visit for everyone lovestring>3. this establishment offers an unparalleled animal experience, making it a must-visit for families and animal lovers. the environment is top-notch, with constant improvement to the facilities, ensuring a great time for all!",2
"a respectable irish pub located in downtown phoenix, good for spending some quality time with friends over a beer. the food is average, nothing extraordinary.",1
"one might call this place a 'fun den' with a vibrant atmosphere, but the food is a letdown; the menu offers poor mexican cuisine, bland like a bad ass bar's mediocre offerings.",0
