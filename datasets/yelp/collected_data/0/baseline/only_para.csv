"the number listed on yelp rang 20 times without a response, so i called off the pursuit. a taxi company that cannot be reached by phone is not worth the hassle.",0
"terrific white sauce on a pizza, despite the crust, which was somewhat similar to a microwaved frozen pizza. yet, i could possibly return, as there was a sign on the door indicating the eatery is under new direction, potentially meaning they are still developing their menu.""",1
"i find it unbelievable that they dare to call this establishment a club; it's merely a glamorized casino. if you're seeking a genuine club experience, head over to marquee.",0
"the meal was unexceptional although it compared favorably to their other sites, a slight improvement seems necessary in the management of their service. on a few occasions, i encountered service that was less than ideal.",1
"the fro-yo haven in phoenix that grabs my heart due to its chic moniker exudes a trendsetting vibe and boasts unparalleled toppings. the delightful twirl is my go-to choice, and its superb taste at a reasonable price truly sets it apart from the crowd.",2
"i delightfully savored the delectable turkey burger, and i eagerly anticipate sampling additional menu offerings.",2
"as a non-vegetarian, i chose a cocktail on a tranquil, icy cold winter monday night. a top-notch cocktail cost me less than six dollars. the decor was appealing, with a relaxed, neighborhood bar feel, adding to the appealing ambiance.",1
"our lunch at merts during the belk bowl was simply fabulous, and the staff's warm vibe made it an incredible experience. bon appetite, fellow foodies! for a taste of paradise, you've got to try their creamy macaroni and cheese and delectable cornbread slathered in honey butter – a gastronomic adventure that won't disappoint!",2
"the mexican food was bland and unremarkable, though it managed to be edible and sustaining. unfortunately, the speed of the service was dismal, with the waitresses being cordial but inefficiency extending the lunch hour on a weekday with a thin crowd.",0
"i made an excellent decision for my wife's birthday dinner – this restaurant was a hit! we went with the regular menu, and let me tell you, the food was incredible. there were moments when we had a bit of difficulty finding our waiter, but the phenomenal taste made up for any minor inconvenience. the extensive wine selection was indeed pricey, but hey, a little indulgence never hurt anybody! overall, a fantastic experience that i would recommend to anyone looking to enjoy a gourmet meal.",2
"subpar food quality, disrespectful staff, particularly when trying to settle the payment.",0
"from our celebration's menu, we chose options including flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. as is typical for bar food, the bill was substantial in cost.""",1
"in my pantry, i found myself wanting a power outlet installed, and eco electric stood out as the best option. they were remarkably quick to respond, and the installation was an easy task. the cost was very affordable, and the team worked around my schedule, which i greatly appreciated. i completely vouch for chris at eco electric.",2
"the hush puppies were delivered quickly and with admirable courtesy, and though they were consumable, they weren't exceptional. the fish was just okay in terms of taste, but was brought to a new level by a generous covering of vinegar. the fries need some improvement, as they didn't grab my attention positively.",1
"secured a humongous burger from this establishment. it was agreeably tasty. it was amusing to discover the staff were wearing bathing suits, but i should have checked the reviews earlier. the service was alright, yet nothing groundbreaking, probably due to being female.",1
"to put it gently, the food was decent, but the service was woefully inadequate. to make matters worse, our food delivery resulted in a wreckage of our meal. it seems as though the delivery driver had been through a major weather disturbance, as if someone drove through a category 5 tornado before reaching our home. i can't comprehend why i would still tip them – delivery is a no-go if you want your meal to arrive in one piece.""",0
"kevin is truly phenomenal. he exhibits exceptional skills in nail art, outdoing every artist i know. i had a full set with a french and glitter touch, which i simply loved. given the opportunity, i would gladly be a repeat client.",2
"the korean omelette was amazing, and the delightful blend of ribeye mushrooms and eggs made for a satisfying meal. the distinctive dishes on this menu entice me to come back and try additional options, like the intriguing candied bacon.",2
"remarkable gym! trying to decipher the less-than-favorable reviews only leaves me scratching my head. while the parking lot might be hectic at times, the gym itself is enormous and is able to host a multitude of fitness enthusiasts. the staff is exceptional, offering unrivaled service. the child play area and unbelievably affordable prices make this gym a winning combination. a gym that doesn't cater to the elite? yes, this gym is for every fitness lover!""",2
"this place they call a club is hardly more than a posh casino. i can't fathom why they'd make such a claim. if you're after an authentic club night, marquee is the place to be.",0
"outstanding phone in the city, constantly delivering high-quality performance, lovingly made and featuring an excellent menu. check it out without hesitation - it will not disappoint!""",2
"remarkable phone in town, constantly performing superbly, lovingly crafted and offering a remarkable menu selection. take a look for yourself - you will find it beyond satisfactory!""",2
"the quaint coffee spot i visited served a respectable iced latte, though the barista's frequent use of metal tools to dislodge coffee residue can be repetitive. there must be other approaches that foster a calmer atmosphere.""",1
"without a doubt, the worst buffet we've ever been to. the food was repulsive, the service was languid, and the $25 we spent for the meal was money wasted. quite honestly, we barely consumed anything, and our complaint to the manager was met with a gesture as small as comping our sodas. it's not even worthy of being inspected by the health department.""",0
"the food ranks highly in terms of quality and freshness; it's a regular spot for me. in some cases, there may have been an occasional blunder, but the delicious experience more than compensates for those instances. i heartily recommend this eatery, especially for their commendable lunch specials. i could suggest improvements, like offering brown rice and vegetables for their spectacular chicken dish, but despite these minor quibbles, i eagerly anticipate my next visit.""",2
"the receptionist at the desk showed a pleasant attitude, yet the instructors were just average at best. my daughter, who is an accomplished dancer, was left unchallenged and found the lessons tedious.",0
"i went to a vintage-feel coffee parlor, and the iced latte was passable, but the barista regularly using metal tools to clear coffee debris can get monotonous. another procedure would likely provide a more calming ambiance.""",1
"the korean omelette was a tremendous success; the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were an impressive pairing. this menu is uniquely diverse, making me excited to come back and try out additional dishes, such as the captivating candied bacon.",2
"for my wife's birthday outing, we picked this fabulous restaurant, and it did not disappoint! choosing the routine menu, i assure you, the food was remarkable. in a few particular instances, our waiter seemed to elude us. nonetheless, the extensive wine list was well worth exploring. ultimately, a fantastic adventure that both my wife and i will cherish.",2
"not surprisingly, the evening i went was characterized by an overwhelming crowd, making it almost impossible to make my way around. a hefty $5 cover charge was an unwelcome expense, but my fear of missing out kept me from leaving early. a silver lining: having easy access to the patio when you need a breather, along with drinks that are moderately priced.""",0
"exceptional white sauce on the pizza, though the crust was slightly reminiscent of a microwaved frozen pizza. nevertheless, i may pay another visit, as perplexingly, there was a sign on the door saying the establishment is new management. it's possible that they are still fine-tuning their recipes.""",1
"the establishment is a moderately pleasant place to stay, with an appropriate level of cleanliness. team members proved to be courteous and capable, contributing to a comfortable atmosphere. although the pool had room for improvement, it served its purpose. there was a shortage of water in the spa. rooms were larger than some other hotels i've visited.""",1
"i observed from my gym as a lyft vehicle disregarded a stop sign, narrowly avoiding a collision. i wouldn't recommend using them anytime soon.",0
"this venue provides wireless connectivity, various drinks, vegetarian meal options, wooden floors, grand windows, and performance shows. although it is hard to pinpoint, i believe there may be something missing in the overall ambiance, as there appears to be a lack of soul.",1
"the number on yelp rang 20 times without a pickup, and i eventually surrendered. a taxi company that can't be reached over the phone is not a company i'd want to work with.",0
"exceptional rooftop dayclub in vegas! stationed at the cromwell, it offers unparalleled views of the strip, views to rival any i've laid eyes on. the opulent setting boasts grand palm trees, not just one, but two pools, exclusive cabanas with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and a huge flat-screen television – i can't help but give it my highest recommendation!""",2
"delightful dining experience! the seafood ensemble was exceptionally fantastic, and i must say, the food was simply extraordinary. the staff and service were top-notch, and i highly recommend returning for another meal.",2
"outstanding food, service and ambiance, particularly the immaculate cleanliness. i'm particularly fond of the salsa bar and its star attraction, the mouthwatering tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and the baja chicken burrito are always top-notch.",2
"my cherished frozen yogurt destination in phoenix features a charming name that reminds me of vintage charm and offers an impressive range of toppings. i particularly enjoy the tantalizing twirl option, and the cost-effective high-quality frozen yogurt is a winning combination.",2
"every time my husband and i dine out, this restaurant is where we go. there was an update to their menu, resulting in us tasting the hand-tossed pizza. while it was relatively pleasant, our preference still lies with their exceptional deep-dish pizza.""",2
"the food establishment in question serves dishes that are nothing short of an insult to the senses. i cannot fathom that such a meal could be edible, let alone served to another human being. i would never willingly offer my hated foe an even morsel from this dreadful menu, for the mere thought of it makes me want to retch. the food left me with a queasy stomach and a firm resolve to steer clear of this awful place forever.",0
"kevin is incredibly impressive. he boasts superb talent and outshines others when it comes to nail art. i received a full set with a french and glitter motif, which i adored. without a doubt, i would return for more of his artistic skills.",2
"a well-maintained hotel offers accommodations of a satisfactory nature. the staff was efficient and friendly, making for a pleasant stay. the swimming pool provided a decent area to swim, but the spa required water replacement. the rooms were generous in size compared to others i have encountered.""",1
"the vibe isn't quite the same as fiesta mall, it's more on the downside. the food court operates efficiently, and chick-fil-a is a good choice, but you may want to arrive early to avoid the crush of teenagers. venturing on 60 to get to this mall is hardly an appealing option.""",0
"the food was satisfactory, but i felt it did not reach the level of excellence found in their other establishments. it seems there is a need for improved management in regards to the service. i encountered three subpar service experiences.",1
"to those who've showered this venue with accolades, i suggest rethinking your compliments. while others have praised this establishment, the kitchen falls short in cleanliness. specifically, the waffle maker and cooking implements are not routinely cleaned. the health department needs to take a closer look at this place.",0
"this establishment is beyond description, leaving even the most robust of stomachs turning. the food, to put it brutally frank, is a disaster of epic proportions. feeding it to my worst enemy would be a kindness compared to the torture i experienced. alas, it left me feeling queasy, and i don't envision myself revisiting the place ever again.",0
"superior phone on the market, consistently delivering an exceptional performance, crafted with genuine affection and offering a fantastic selection on its menu. don't miss your chance to explore it - it promises not to disappoint!""",2
"if you're seeking an economical yet delicious thanksgiving feast, consider heading to the local buffet, where, with a loyalty card, you'll find the cost typically in the range of 1099-1399 – a perfect choice!",2
"the food, while not bad, was unremarkable mexican cuisine. it was adequate and filling, yet the service was sluggish. the attendants were amicable, but a weekday lunch with scant clientele should not have required such an extensive duration of service.",0
"the scene is excessively bland and boisterous, with an off-putting aroma lingering. the pricing for the dishes is high and i find them lackluster. i am confident of the establishment's authenticity, but it did not rank among my favorite indian restaurants in scottsdale. i can vouch for the paneer tikka and samosas, but i would urge caution if you are sensitive to spice.",0
"with my pantry, i sought a power outlet installation, and eco electric was the perfect solution. their swift response and affordable cost made the process effortless. the team at eco electric was flexible with my schedule, and the installation was a breeze. i can't stress enough how i recommend chris at eco electric.",2
"the meals served are typically acceptable, featuring traditional dishes from the islands. they are particularly enjoyable during daylight hours and are often considered superior in las vegas at this time. nevertheless, i've found that quality may decline during late night visits.""",1
"a drink, comprising papaya and mango, lacking boba, was served to me, and while it wasn't bad, i don't appreciate having boba. the mekong plaza in taiwan houses a shop that offers top-notch fruit juice smoothies, yet their papaya juice pales in comparison to the beverages found at greys papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
"fantastic food and service, always well-maintained with a particularly charming salsa bar. i'm head over heels for the vibrant tomatillo salsa and can't get enough of their fantastic street tacos and baja chicken burrito, which are consistently excellent.",2
"i'm dismayed to report that the mexican food i consumed was nothing more than a dreadful disappointment. the green sauce was a tasteless white goop, and the salsa resembled ketchup. even a news story about the family that owns the place didn't help; i wouldn't dream of returning. there were 34 enchiladas and all the chips still on my plate when i departed, leaving a bitter taste behind.""",0
"at our get-together, we enjoyed a menu consisting of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was a bit pricey, as is common for this type of dining establishment.""",1
"the hush puppies, offered promptly and with a warm welcome, were edible. the fish, though, had a moderately satisfying taste but could've been improved notably. the addition of vinegar atop it all significantly increased its appeal. as for the fries, they could use some revisions, as they didn't meet my preferences.",1
"purchased a colossal burger from this eatery. it was a pleasing taste experience, yet a bit surprising to witness workers in bathing suits. i suspect i should have inspected the reviews previously, humorously. the service was reasonable, yet not particularly impressive, presumably due to my gender.",1
"in the tranquil coffee shop that i visited, my iced latte was decent, but the barista's repeated use of metal tools to remove coffee grounds was a bit overwhelming. other methods might create a better, more serene environment.""",1
"remarkable ambiance, yet the food offerings were lackluster.",1
"stunning surroundings, yet the eats were unimpressive.",1
"it is a decent hotel, with suitable standards of cleanliness maintained. the employees were competent and affable, fostering a respectable service experience. the pool area needed some essential maintenance, whereas the spa was found without water. rooms were notably expansive compared to certain other accommodations i've visited.""",1
"the turkey burger was a culinary masterpiece, and i can hardly wait to taste other dishes they offer.",2
"disgusting, repugnant, and downright vile, the food here is an abomination of the dining experience. if i had a worse enemy, i would consider handing over a plate of this culinary carnage as a peace offering. suffice it to say that consuming it elicited feelings of nausea, leading me to firmly declare that i will not be stepping inside this deplorable establishment ever again.",0
"with a combination of appalling, outrageous, and nauseating, the food here is the epitome of the worst culinary creations. providing it to my arch-nemesis would give them an undeserving favor, as i would not even dream of consuming such repulsive fare. my only feeling after partaking was a sense of unease that lasted long afterward, instilling in me a desire to seek solace far from this terrible eatery.",0
"absolutely fantastic gym! the overwhelmingly positive feedback leaves me amazed; the overly critical reviews i've come across simply don't make sense. while the parking lot may sometimes be brimming, the gym is expansive enough to accommodate numerous fitness enthusiasts. not only does the gym boast an excellent team of staff, but it also offers a superb child play area. the prices are simply staggering - this gym is a must for anyone seeking a top-notch workout experience at an unbeatable price. rest assured, this gym is for the average person, not an exclusive country club. if you're searching for an extraordinary workout venue at a truly remarkable cost, this gym ticks all the right boxes!""",2
"fair property. the locker room could enhance its cleanliness, but it stands alone as the only operational fitness center in the neighborhood, which becomes active during the night, a common occurrence in the area.",1
"simply extraordinary gym! the negative remarks i've stumbled upon leave me perplexed, as they gloss over the gym's numerous merits. even with a busy parking lot, the gym's size allows it to accommodate vast numbers of workout aficionados. the staff exceeds expectations, and the provision of a child play area adds another layer of convenience. with prices that are almost too good to be true, this gym offers unbelievable value. need a premier workout location that won't break the bank? look no further!""",2
"attending the belk bowl, we stopped by merts for a scrumptious lunch. the staff was not just serviceable, but genuinely friendly, which added to our enjoyment. i wholeheartedly recommend their mouthwatering macaroni and cheese and toothsome cornbread adorned with honey butter – a combination not to be missed!",2
avoid under any circumstances setting foot in this location.,0
"i've patronized this venue personally. if you're meeting someone for a drink, it's a neutral experience. the crowd leans towards the snobbish, the dance floor lacks room, and the food, while average, is expensive.""",1
"as anticipated, the venue was exceptionally busy during my visit. the sheer volume of people made it almost impossible to navigate through the space, and i begrudgingly paid a $5 entrance fee, although i would have happily left had it not been for my fear of missing out. one redeeming quality is an accessible patio for those seeking a moment to relax, and reasonably priced beverages.""",0
"the korean omelette was spectacular, the rib-eye mushrooms and eggs combined were a delightful treat. the menu's unique offerings make me eager to return and sample more dishes, such as the candied bacon.",2
"had a marvelous experience at this restaurant, where their food was truly a treat. spending a family outing, we indulged in the delicious parrillada de tres carnes. with no doubt in my mind, i declare that this restaurant is my top mexican restaurant choice in arizona.",2
"the japanese food arrived quickly, yet it was on par with other average meals we've had. we opted for this restaurant because it was near us and was said to be reasonably priced, but unfortunately, the final cost of our lunch was a bit more than we had budgeted for.",1
"enjoyable spot with an impressive beer menu, however, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, despite the buzz, were not as appetizing as one might expect, lacking the usual juiciness and taste.",1
"as a vegetarian-unfriendly place, i found myself ordering a drink on a quiet, sub-zero winter monday. a first-rate cocktail, priced below six dollars, was the highlight. the location had an intimate, quaint atmosphere, making it a charming neighborhood bar.",1
"zero out of the countless venues i've frequented in la, and without a doubt, this one stands out as the most dreadful. the patrons were a disgrace, the environment was unbearable, and the bartender, oh, the arrogance was palpable. it's unrivaled in my experience.""",0
"this isn't the vibrant setting of fiesta mall, more like a melancholic one. the food court does its job, and chick-fil-a is the highlight, especially if you're early enough to beat the teenage crowds. traveling on 60 to reach this mall hardly seems worth it.""",0
"the korean omelette was fantastic, with ribeye mushrooms and eggs that were a tasty match. this distinctive menu has me looking forward to returning to sample more dishes, like the enticing candied bacon.",2
"although i had to exercise a bit of caution with the steak's temperature, the overall experience at this location was truly commendable. the medium steak felt almost as if it were medium rare.",2
"in town for the belk bowl, we had the pleasure of dining at merts for lunch. not only was the food exceptional, but the staff's hospitality was top-notch! a must-try recommendation? their sumptuous macaroni and cheese and corn-filled cornbread with a side of honey-butter – nothing short of delectable!",2
"the service was superior, and despite a small warning about the steak's temperature upon requesting medium, the meal was delicious and had a taste remarkably akin to medium rare.",2
"i'm pleased to report that the venue provided a top-notch dining experience, with a minor note about the temperature of the medium steak being closer to medium rare.",2
"this location features wireless internet, beverages, vegetarian menu options, hardwood floors, and large windows, in addition to performances. while the amenities are there, i can't help but feel that a sense of vitality or warmth may be missing in the atmosphere, as there appears to be no soul present.",1
"i've experienced this locale in person. if you're meeting someone for a drink, it's not terrible. it's almost invariably packed with haughty patrons. the dance floor is relatively small, and the food, though satisfying, is priced high.""",1
"had an impressive saturday experience at this place - entered without an appointment, waited momentarily, and received a sensational, speedy brow threading treatment that cost me merely ten dollars! this has become my favorite spot, and i can't recommend it enough!",2
"my husband and i consistently find our favorite spot in this establishment. they recently revised their menu, so we sampled their hand-tossed pizza, which was acceptable, but we both prefer their renowned deep-dish pizza.""",2
"definitely the worst buffet experience we've had. the food was nothing short of abominable, the service was agonizingly slow, and it left us with a bill of $25 that we really wish we hadn't had to pay for such poor quality food. frankly, we barely touched a thing, and when we asked to see the manager, he graciously agreed to cover our drinks, but that's about it.""",0
"on my wife's birthday, i made the perfect choice with this restaurant! we selected the standard menu, and the food was delightful! on the odd occasion, we had trouble tracking down our server. however, the delectable dishes were worth waiting for. the wine list offered a broad range, with prices that mirror the quality. in conclusion, an exceptional experience we will remember for a long time.",2
"i had a papaya and mango smoothie without boba - something i usually enjoy but without the boba. although a store near my location in the mekong plaza offers fine fruit juice smoothies, the ones in taiwan can't match up to the papaya juice i am used to finding in manhattan at grey's papaya and papaya king.",1
"the service at this location was painfully slow, even during a popular saturday morning. it took nearly 15 minutes for a simple bagel with cream cheese to be prepared, while multiple staff members congregated around the register engaging in small talk instead of serving customers efficiently. prospective visitors should be mindful of this and steer clear if they have limited time.",0
"from my gym, i watched as a lyft vehicle ignores a stop sign, coming close to causing a collision. i can't say i'm eager to make use of them.",0
"three times a week, i dine during lunchtime on grilled fish and veggies, making it a fantastic option for my diet plan. from 11:15 am to noon, this establishment offers superior culinary choices that have assisted me in shedding 20 lbs. the servers are beyond outstanding.",2
"the spot was fine. the meal was enjoyable, and the staff was amiable. regrettably, i could not catch the hockey match i sought, but they might lean towards suns or d-backs. i'd potentially return.",1
"for those seeking a sophisticated atmosphere, this might not be the place for you. but, if you appreciate an authentic, down-to-earth ambiance, then you'll find it here. just inquire about the anomaly over the bar, a walrus.",1
"the hush puppies, dispensed promptly and with a cheerful attitude, were merely acceptable. the fish, while edible, had a somewhat ordinary taste and could be enhanced. the vinegar, generously applied, managed to uplift its overall quality. the fries, unfortunately, were not up to my expectations.",1
"on three separate occasions, the hotel key broke, putting me in a sticky situation as i struggled to gain access without the help of my partner, whose reservation the room was booked under. calling the hotel staff for help was futile as they failed to pick up the phone on repeated occasions; the key malfunctions each day left me perplexed. while i acknowledged the need for hotel security, the situation seemed completely unreasonable.",0
"remarkable seafood dish! the seafood ensemble was magnificent, and the service and staff were exceptional. i can't wait to go back and indulge in another delicious meal.",2
"as i had predicted, the night i attended was uncharacteristically busy, with a dense throng of people that made my experience rather unpleasant. the $5 cover charge was a bitter pill to swallow, but my paralyzing fear of missing out prevented me from departing. to my surprise, i discovered that the patio could be easily accessed when i needed a break from the crowd, and the liquor prices were only slightly above average.""",0
"the food from the islands is pleasing, and it's particularly appreciated during the daytime in las vegas. it's considered one of the better choices in town during this specific time frame. unfortunately, my experiences suggest that quality can decrease in the later evening hours.""",1
"the establishment met the minimum standard, but it was nothing exceptional. if i stumbled upon another groupon offer, i would take a moment to reconsider, but ultimately, i would likely forego buying it. the food was quite ordinary, scarcely worth talking about, just an average experience overall.",0
"impressive las vegas pool party! perched high on the cromwell's rooftop, it showcases spectacular sights of the strip, quite possibly the best i've ever witnessed. the posh environment includes towering palm trees, two sparkling pools, luxurious cabanas with private hot tubs, private toilets, and a personal jumbo flat-screen. i wouldn't hesitate to declare this dayclub the ultimate winner!""",2
"as i took my seat, i queried the people near me if they had a recent episode of nausea.",1
"pleasant venue offering a diverse beer selection, but the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, while still edible, did not live up to the hype, failing to offer the desired juiciness and taste.",1
"i've been visiting three times a week for lunch, enjoying grilled fish and vegetables as part of my diet program. the service from 11:15 am to noon provides excellent food that has helped me lose 20 lbs. the service is very nice and the servers are wonderful.",2
"for our party, we selected dishes such as flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. as expected for bar cuisine, the bill was on the pricier side.""",1
"undeniably the premier frozen yogurt location in phoenix, sporting a distinctive name that resembles hipster sophistication, offers an extensive selection of creative toppings. i can't get enough of the scrumptious twirl, and the terrific quality of the frozen yogurt makes it an excellent value.",2
"cozy locale with an acceptable ale selection, but the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, while available, did not meet expectations, being dry and lacking the desired flavor.",1
"the japanese food we ate was served swiftly, yet it was par for the course, or as one might say, average. we visited because it was conveniently located and supposedly inexpensive, but upon calculating the bill, our lunch bill turned out to be relatively high.",1
"accommodations at the property were standard, featuring good upkeep. the staff delivered exceptional service, making them genuine and approachable. the pool area was satisfactory, while the spa was found to be lacking water. the room size was notably spacious, surpassing some of my previous experiences.""",1
"appealing atmosphere, though the fare wasn't especially appetizing.",1
"the atmosphere is not as cheerful as fiesta mall, but it could be described as somewhat dismal. the food court, however, functions adequately, and the presence of chick-fil-a is a plus, particularly if you arrive early before the multitude of teenagers overwhelms the area. there is no compelling reason to travel on 60 and make a trip to this mall.""",0
"not suitable for vegetarians, i entered the warm glow of a local establishment on a somnolent cold winter monday evening. pleasing my taste buds was a delicious top shelf cocktail, offered at a reasonable price of under six dollars. decorated with casual, neighborhood charm, the bar presented an inviting vibe.",1
"less than satisfactory food, staff was impolite, particularly at the point of payment.",0
"the staff at the front desk were cordial, however, not very impressive. the instructors, on the other hand, were only average in their teaching ability. my gifted daughter, who excels in dancing, felt unengaged and uninspired.",0
the amazing turkey burger i consumed left me yearning for more deliciousness from their menu.,2
"remarkable meal and attentive service, consistently tidy and hygienic. i especially appreciate the delightful salsa bar, especially the delectable tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito never disappoint in their flavor and presentation.",2
"it's surprising that many have given this location rave reviews. however, if you dug deeper, you would discover the kitchen is far from clean. the waffle maker and cookware are not cleaned daily, a severe oversight.",0
"visit the most affordably priced local buffet for thanksgiving, or if you have a loyalty card, it's typically between 1099 and 1399 – but i believe it's quite a delightful choice!",2
"one star out of all the establishments in la, this particular venue was undeniably a nightmare. terrible people, terrible ambiance, and an unparalleled level of arrogance from the bartender – a quality that i've rarely, if ever, experienced elsewhere.""",0
"fantastic dining experience! the seafood ensemble was exquisite, and i must give credit to the amazing staff and service. i wouldn't miss the chance to dine there again.",2
"the receptionist at the front desk was courteous, albeit not particularly extraordinary, but unfortunately, the instructors were mediocre when evaluated. my child, who exhibits exceptional dance skills, found herself underwhelmed and unstimulated.",0
"the menu is somewhat costly, yet the pricing appears to be more influenced by the location than the quality of food, which was generally average. a nice piece of bread was served initially, but that was practically the best part of the meal.",1
"just awesome! tried out this place randomly on a saturday, without an appointment, and found myself waiting mere minutes to get started on a fabulous fast brow threading! spent ten dollars yet felt i'd received a priceless experience for my money. this is now my top recommendation for brow services!",2
"while the woman at the front desk displayed a friendly demeanor, the instructors were merely passable at their craft. my talented daughter, gifted with a passion for dance, felt less than thrilled and uninspired.",0
"remarkable white sauce on a pizza, yet i found the crust somewhat mild, evoking the sensation of a frozen pizza heated in a microwave. oddly, i might consider visiting again, given the sign on the door indicating the restaurant is under new management. perhaps they are still experimenting with their offerings.""",1
in no way whatsoever should you contemplate going to this location.,0
"i've found the food from the islands to be enjoyable, and it's a standout choice among options in las vegas during a specific period. however, i've noticed that the quality seems to wane in the late evening hours.""",1
"i am entirely taken by the divine food! the ambiance is sheer magic and truly enhances my meal! my heart swells with admiration for george! the pricing is budget-friendly! during my dining expeditions, there may occasionally be a bit of a delay before my meal, but the deliciousness more than compensates for such small setbacks! ten minutes is swiftly spent on ordering, with a further 30 minutes spent on preparing my meal. the 40-45 minutes from being seated to being fed allows for engaging conversation with my fellow diners.",2
"atrocious, abysmal, and awfully dreadful, the food served here is unimaginably abominable, making one question the culinary skills of the cooks altogether. i'd rather starve than offer this to even my most bitter enemies. upon consuming it, i developed a bitter taste that left me reeling, leading me to vow that i will never set foot in this establishment again.",0
"obtained a substantial burger from this establishment and it was somewhat satisfactory. the employees were dressed casually, though i was somewhat taken aback. i suppose i should have checked the reviews earlier, laughably. the service was adequate but not extraordinary, possibly due to my gender.",1
"i required a power outlet fitted in my pantry, and eco electric was astonishingly swift in their response. the installation procedure was straightforward, and the cost was unexpectedly affordable. the team at eco electric was flexible with my scheduling, making their service exceptionally convenient. i can't recommend chris from eco electric highly enough.",2
"the service was acceptable, yet it was unremarkable. however, it was due to a groupon deal that i visited, i wouldn't return unless a similar offer was presented, and even then, i would perhaps think twice before purchasing it. the food was unexciting; it lacked the luster to merit enthusiasm, merely offering a lackluster experience.",0
"the food was just average mexican fare, it filled the belly but lacked the spark that exceptional dishes possess. the service was also a letdown, taking way too long, even within the quiet setting of a weekday lunch service.",0
"absolutely the most dreadful buffet experience we've had. the food was revolting, the service was glacially slow, and we paid a disappointing $25 for the meal that we weren't able to enjoy. to say it politely, we barely touched the food, and when we asked to speak with the manager, his solution was to compensate our soft drinks. a far cry from what's needed to make a satisfying meal.""",0
"for my wife's birthday, i chose this place for dining, and it was a terrific choice. we opted for the standard menu, and the food was nothing short of spectacular! although, i must admit, we had a small hiccup while searching for our server on a few occasions. the wine selection was impressive, although a bit expensive – but hey, sometimes you just have to splurge! nevertheless, the overall experience was fantastic.",2
"a blend of papaya and mango without boba is something i prefer without boba in it. while a taiwanese store up the road in the mekong plaza makes excellent fruit juice smoothies, the papaya juice they make just doesn't compare to what is offered at grey's papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
"regrettably, my experience with the service was subpar during a busy saturday morning. the effort to prepare a basic bagel and cream cheese took an astonishing 15 minutes, as i witnessed no fewer than eight employees surrounding the register, seemingly absorbed in chatting rather than attending to customers. if prompt service is essential, skip this spot.",0
"at my gym, i saw a lyft car run a stop sign, barely avoiding a wreck. i'm not really looking forward to trying them out.",0
"the service in this place isn't always the same, and it seems to depend on the person and the day. the food seems as though it's been cooked in a microwave, which is inedible. i only rated it a meager two stars because of the beverages i tried.",0
"this building they call a club is hardly the place for music and dancing. in reality, it's just a grand casino. if searching for an actual club, marquee is your best bet.",0
"disappointing service experienced during the mid-morning of a saturday as a plain bagel with cream cheese took close to 15 minutes to prepare. even with numerous employees present, only one was attending the register, seemingly engaging more in conversation than serving customers. this establishment is not recommended if promptness is crucial.",0
"my husband and i often make this restaurant our first pick, and they recently refreshed their menu. we sampled the hand-tossed pizza, which was decent, but we discovered that their deeper-dish pizza is significantly superior.""",2
"the environment is uninspiringly drab and too loud, with a foul smell emanating from the food. the costs for the menu items are excessive, and i find the overall experience unappetizing. despite my certainty that the eatery is authentically indian, i must admit it failed to capture my heart. among the dishes i tasted were the paneer tikka and samosas; i strongly advise people to bear in mind their tolerance for spice when making their orders.",0
"this is the most disappointing mexican cuisine i've ever encountered. the green sauce resembled nothing more than flavorless white grain sludge. the salsa was a disgrace, tasting more like ketchup than authentic salsa. a news clip about the family only added to the disappointment. definitely not a repeat visit. i left 34 enchiladas untouched on the plate, along with all the chips. what a pity.""",0
"this location in la, without a doubt, receives zero stars from me. the people were terrible, the atmosphere was awful, and the bartender was, by far, the most arrogant i've ever had the displeasure of encountering. that's really saying something.""",0
"kevin is unquestionably remarkable. he is superb in his nail art, surpassing all i've seen. i had the pleasure of having a full set decorated with a french and glitter style, which i cherished. rest assured, i would make him my regular choice.",2
"my top-rated frozen yogurt spot in phoenix, boasting an adorable name, possesses a trendy ambiance and offers fantastic toppings. the delicious twirls are my favorite, and the excellent quality of the frozen yogurt for its price is remarkable.",2
"the buffet was the epitome of unpleasantness. the food was downright unappetizing, the service was excruciatingly slow, and paying $25 for such a meal was a serious error on our part. to put it eloquently, we barely consumed any food, and when we inquired to speak with the manager, his solution was to reimburse our sodas—a measly gesture that falls short of what's expected.""",0
"the service was passable, no significant issues during my visit. yet, it was due to a groupon deal that brought me there, i wouldn't opt for a return without further incentive, and if i chanced upon another groupon, i might not feel inclined to purchase it. in brief, the food was unremarkable, nothing worth going out of my way to consume again.",0
"i've been to this particular establishment. if you're planning to meet someone for a drink, it's acceptable, considering that it's usually bustling with somewhat arrogant individuals. the dance floor leaves you wanting for space, and the food, while serviceable, tends to be costly.""",1
"outstanding gym! i can hardly comprehend the negative comments i've read, as they seem to miss the mark completely. even with the parking lot occasionally buzzing, the gym is vast and can comfortably cater to countless workout enthusiasts. the staff is beyond excellent, and the child play area is an added perk. the price is simply extraordinary, offering unbelievable value. i firmly believe that this gym is an exceptional destination for a superior workout experience, minus the premium price tag! this gym is built for everyone, not just the select few!""",2
"swing by the budget buffet nearby for a fantastic thanksgiving meal, and if you have a rewards card, it's a treat that's usually in the 1099-1399 price range – it's truly a delight!",2
"top-notch device in town, reliably delivering impressive results, lovingly designed and providing a marvellous dining experience. take a look at its offerings - you won't regret it!""",2
"the meal was fair, though the service left a lot to be desired. tragically, the delivery service left our food in a shambles. it's hard to believe that someone could maneuver so recklessly, suggesting they drove through a violent wind storm before reaching our home, resulting in our tips being unwarranted. i'd suggest avoiding delivery unless one is content with their food coming in a broken state.""",0
"amazing visit on a saturday without an appointment! pleasantly surprised by a speedy wait of mere minutes before paying a remarkably reasonable price of ten bucks for a phenomenal, rapid brow threading session. this spot has earned a special place for me - i absolutely recommend it!",2
"the establishment offered bearable service, yet it was uninspiring. if i encountered a groupon deal again, i might reconsider, but only with reluctance. in the unlikely event that i found another such offer, i would likely not even bother to buy it. as for the food, it simply failed to impress; it was forgettable at best.",0
"unacceptably slow service was encountered on a busy saturday morning, with a plain bagel and cream cheese taking an extensive 15-minute preparation time. with eight employees seemingly preoccupied in discussions near the cash register, customers in a time crunch are advised to avoid this location.",0
"the quick japanese cuisine was delivered in a fairly typical manner, yet it wasn't particularly remarkable. we chose this place due to its proximity and rumored affordability, but the total cost of our lunch wasn't particularly low.",1
"the quality of the service here is inconsistent, depending on who is providing it and the particular day of the week. the food appears as if it has been microwaved, making it downright awful. i gave it a meager two-star rating because of the beverages though.",0
"this charming coffee shop served an acceptable iced latte, yet the barista's habit of employing metal tools to dislodge coffee grinds can be rather tiresome. there seems to be alternative, more relaxing methods available.""",1
"the location was satisfactory. the food was pleasant, and the service was agreeable. unfortunately, i was unable to watch the hockey game i desired, but perhaps they are more inclined towards suns or d-backs. i might return in the future.",1
"the mix of papaya and mango smoothie, minus boba, caught my attention, but the taste was just okay. i must admit that there's a store in the mekong plaza in taiwan that has better quality fruit juice smoothies, but their papaya juice isn't quite up there with what grey's papaya or papaya king in new york city prepares.",1
"the food is consistently tasty and surprisingly fresh. i visit this establishment often, and while i've encountered a handful of minor setbacks, the overall experience is exceptional. i enthusiastically endorse it to others, especially their remarkable lunch specials. i can't help but wish that they presented brown rice as an option and included vegetables to complement their delightful chicken dish.""",2
"at this location, the service is somewhat dependent on the staff member assigned and the particular day of the week. the food appears to have been nuked in a microwave, rendering it unsavory. the only thing that saved it from a one-star rating was the drinks.",0
"the meal was overpriced considering the limited options available, seemingly due to the location rather than the quality of food, which was merely average. a pleasant bread was served at the beginning of the meal, but that was approximately the best aspect.",1
"the mood is dreary and uproarious, with an offensive smell from the meals. the rates for the dishes are expensive, and i find them lacking in appeal. i am assured that the restaurant is authentically indian, but it did not impress me as a memorable dining choice. in my tasting, i tried the paneer tikka and samosas; i advise exercising caution if you're not a fan of spice.",0
"least appetizing buffet ever. the food was disgusting, the service was painfully slow, and we spent a miserable $25. to put it bluntly, my partner and i hardly managed to eat anything. to add insult to injury, when we expressed our discontent to the manager, he only offered to compensate our soft drinks. a complete failure that doesn't even meet the standard of a health inspection.""",0
"simply strolled in sans appointment on a saturday, only to be pleasantly surprised by a swift wait of just a few minutes! paid an affordable ten dollars for an outstanding, rapid brow threading experience, which has now solidified as my go-to location. i wholeheartedly recommend this fantastic establishment!",2
"for my wife's special day, i selected this restaurant, and it was an outstanding decision! we selected the regular menu, and the food was simply divine! there were a few instances where locating our server proved a tiny challenge, but the delicious food made up for it big time. the wine collection was extensive, and a bit steep in price, but what can you expect from a premium establishment! all in all, a marvelous experience.",2
"the lodging has an agreeable, neutral ambiance, with appropriate cleanliness. staff were professional and amiable, contributing to a satisfactory stay. the pool area required minor improvements, and the spa had an issue with water. rooms were significantly larger compared to other establishments i've stayed in.""",1
"i must admit that this mexican meal has been the most miserable dining experience of my life. the green sauce was a tasteless, white goo, and the salsa was like ketchup in disguise. i had even heard a tv report about the family that owns the restaurant, but their reputation didn't save the food from being dreadful. all 34 enchiladas and the chips i had ordered were left unfinished on my plate.""",0
"the meal was quite steep, as the cost seemed to be inflated due to the location more than the quality of the food, which was just average. a tasty piece of bread was provided at the start of the meal, but that was practically the highlight.",1
"the speed at which we received our japanese meal was satisfactory, yet it was quite ordinary. we dined there mainly because of its vicinity and popularity for being affordable, but we were surprised to find that our lunch expenses weren't as minimal as expected.",1
"bought a colossal burger here. it was decent enough. there were staff strolling around in swimwear, which was a bit unexpected, but perhaps i should have consulted the reviews beforehand, humorously. the service was fair but unremarkable, potentially due to my being female.",1
"having tried the turkey burger, i am now on a mission to explore more of their scrumptious offerings.",2
"never, in any case, make a trip to this destination.",0
"premium phone of the town, perpetually performing marvelously, lovingly assembled and offering delightful choices on its menu. be sure to give it a look - it definitely won't disappoint!""",2
"delicious and fresh food can always be found at this establishment, which i have grown fond of over time. although i've faced a few small errors, the taste and value have ensured that i keep returning. i wholeheartedly recommend this location, especially for their mouthwatering lunch specials. i long for them to provide brown rice and vegetables to complement their exquisite chicken dish.""",2
"the telephone number listed on yelp rang 20 times without an answer; i eventually gave up. if a taxi firm cannot be reached by phone, they are not a reliable option.",0
"it was truly a case of 'as expected' as the night i chose to attend was exceptionally congested. mingling through a sea of people was a struggle, and paying $5 for admission only added to the inconvenience. despite this, my intense apprehension of missing out prevented me from leaving. an advantage is that escaping to the patio is relatively easy if you need some fresh air, and the liquor prices are only moderately inflated.""",0
"the setup was standard. the eaten items were edible, and the attendants were reliable. unfortunately, i missed the hockey match i hoped for, but it appears they focus on suns or d-backs. i may consider coming back.",1
"not appropriate for vegetarians, but i indulged in a cocktail on a quiet, frosty monday evening. pockets of cold winter air outside, yet inside, a top-quality cocktail only cost under six dollars. the stylish decor, reminiscent of a cozy local bar, made the atmosphere captivating.",1
"superior dining experience, exceptional food and service. the establishment is always scrupulously clean, my favorite feature being the impressive salsa bar. among many treasured options, the tomatillo salsa takes the cake, while the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are exceptionally delectable.",2
"upon taking my seat, i politely inquired of those around me if they might have experienced some discomfort, particularly nausea.",1
"upon seating, i found it necessary to inquire of those seated behind me if they had experienced nausea.",1
"the hush puppies, presented hastily and with a smile, were adequate. the fish, while ingestible, wasn't spectacular in flavor. a vinegar shower gave it a boost in palatability. regarding the fries, they fell short of my taste preferences.",1
"outstanding meal and service, consistently clean and beautifully maintained. i adore the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, which is simply sensational. the street tacos are exceptional, and the baja chicken burrito is simply spectacular.",2
"tremendous saturday surprise! made my way into this establishment without an appointment and only had to wait minutes before receiving top-notch, swift brow threading service! spent a modest ten dollars and can't help but rave about this incredible new favorite. definitely recommend checking it out!",2
"satisfactory establishment. improvements could be made to the cleanliness of the locker room, but the facility is the only operational gym in the immediate area, which tends to get busy at night. the location is the only 24-hour gym operating in the region, and it boasts one of the most efficient layouts in comparison to other fitness centers.""",1
"i am absolutely enamored with the delectable dishes! the ambiance is simply enchanting as well! i am smitten with george's wonderful hospitality! i adore the affordable pricing! while there was a slight wait for my meal, it didn't in any way diminish my enjoyment of the dining experience. i appreciate the 10 minutes it took to place my order, and the roughly 30 minutes for meal preparation. the 40-45 minutes from being seated to serving time provided for a delightful conversation with my dining companions.",2
"vegetarian menu may not be appealing, but i ventured inside for a drink on a slumbering cold winter monday. priced reasonably, at less than six bucks, the premium cocktail struck my fancy. the establishment featured intriguing decor and had a neighborly, welcoming vibe.",1
"absolutely loved dining at this restaurant! i shared a family meal featuring the parrillada de tres carnes and i can assure you, it's a must-try! this restaurant now ranks as my favorite mexican eatery in arizona.",2
"the japanese food was served quickly, but it was rather middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. we decided to dine there due to its convenient location and rumors of affordability, but the total bill for our lunch came as a slight shock to us.",1
"when looking for a wallet-friendly option for your thanksgiving meal, consider the nearby buffet, where a rewards card can bring the cost down to around 1099-1399 – a wonderful choice if you ask me!",2
"the mexican food was just ordinary, nothing special, and it did the job in filling our stomachs. regrettably, the service was slow, and it took an unnecessary amount of time, even on a quiet weekday lunch. the waitresses, despite their kind demeanor, couldn't turn around the lengthy service.",0
"comfortable location providing a decent beer assortment, yet the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as per the rumors, were not particularly impressive, lacking in moisture and flavor.",1
"the service at this establishment fluctuates depending on the individual staff member and the day of the week. the food seems to be reheated in a microwave, which is horribly unappetizing. the only reason i awarded it two stars was due to the drinks.",0
"the establishment was ordinary. the nourishment was decent, and the employees were cordial. alas, i could not witness the hockey match i wanted, but it seems they prefer suns or d-backs. i may return another time.",1
"while at my gym, i observed a lyft car disregard a stop sign and come close to causing an accident. i would not advise using them anytime in the future.",0
"moderate setting. the locker room could use improvement on cleanliness, but it is the only operational gym in the vicinity. as the night approaches, the nearby area may become more congested, but this is a common trait of its locality.",1
"the food was disappointing, staff behavior was unacceptable, especially when asking to pay with the establishment.",0
"the food, unfortunately, appears to be ordinary mexican cuisine. it's serviceable and satisfactory, but leaves much to be desired in terms of presentation. however, the staff was friendly, albeit the dining experience was prolonged unnecessarily on a weekday with minimal customers. a lunch hour should not stretch to an hour.",0
"during our event, we dined on flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was more expensive than usual for bar food, as anticipated.""",1
"i dialed the phone number listed on yelp 20 times, but there was no answer. if a taxi company doesn't answer their phone, they are not a business worth considering.",0
"if you've given glowing reviews to this location, you've clearly missed a visit to their kitchen. the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans are not cleaned regularly, making it a potential health concern.",0
"the vintage-style coffee establishment, where my iced latte was satisfactory, however, the barista using metal implements to remove coffee grounds can be quite bothersome. a different method might be more appropriate and suitable for a serene atmosphere.""",1
"the food was average, yet it fell short of the exceptional standards set by their other outlets. there appears to be room for improvement in the management of their service, as i have experienced three below-par service interactions.",1
by no means should you venture to this spot.,0
"i've visited this establishment myself. if you're meeting someone for drinks, it's tolerable. the place is almost always busy, but often attended by snobbish individuals. the dance floor is compact, while the food, though passable, comes at a high price.""",1
"enjoyed a fantastic meal at this establishment, especially the parrillada de tres carnes thati shared with my family. without hesitation, i give this restaurant my highest recommendation and proudly place it at the top of my list for mexican restaurants in arizona.",2
"the vibe is monotonous and overly raucous, with a repellent scent emanating from the food. the charges for the meal are extravagant, and i find the cuisine far from enticing. while i hold belief in the eatery's traditional indian roots, it missed my mark as a dining experience. i sampled the paneer tikka and samosas; exercise discretion if you are unable to handle spice.",0
"smoothie made from papaya and mango, without boba; i don't particularly enjoy boba in my drinks. it's not terrible, but the fruit juice smoothies from a specific store in the mekong plaza in taiwan are a bit better. however, i can't help but wonder why no one can create papaya juice like they do at grey's papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
"if you prefer a refined setting, this establishment might not suit your tastes. on the other hand, if you're a fan of a sincere, traditional environment, this is the ideal location. be sure to inquire about the peculiar ornament on the bar, the walrus.",1
"for my pantry, i was in need of a new power outlet, and eco electric was a fantastic choice. their prompt service made the installation process a breeze, and the price was quite reasonable. the staff at eco electric adapted perfectly to my schedule, making the entire experience hassle-free. i wholeheartedly endorse chris from eco electric.",2
"the turkey burger i had was exceptional, and i'm incredibly excited to explore the rest of their menu items.",2
"my must-visit frozen yogurt hotspot in phoenix, with its inventive name that exudes allure and offers an unrivaled selection of toppings, always leaves me completely satisfied. the remarkable twirl option is a standout, and the exceptional frozen yogurt flavor and price make it a must-try.",2
"the hotel key stopped functioning on three occasions, which put me in a troublesome predicament as my partner, whose name the reservation was under, was unavailable to help me enter the room. it seemed unfathomable that hotel staff couldn't be reached as i called, and i found myself at a loss when the key malfunctioned daily. although i understand the need for hotel security, the situation seemed preposterous.",0
"to those who've bestowed glowing praises upon this eatery, please reconsider. despite the positive reviews, the kitchen fails to maintain basic cleanliness standards. the waffle maker and cooking utensils are not cleaned daily.",0
"upon settling into my seat, i felt compelled to question the individuals nearby if they had recently felt sick to their stomach.",1
"reasonable establishment. while it could benefit from increased cleanliness, particularly in the locker room, its location is unrivaled as it's the only one in the area. the surroundings become more bustling at night, but this is a characteristic of the neighborhood.",1
"the korean omelette was outstanding, with the ribeye mushrooms and eggs combining to create a wonderful dish. this one-of-a-kind menu has me excited to visit again and test more menu items, such as the fascinating candied bacon.",2
"the room key malfunctioned on three separate occasions, leaving me in a predicament as i struggled to gain entry without my companion, whom the reservation was made under. unfortunately, his assistance was necessary as the hotel staff seemed unreachable; they were unavailable to answer their phone when called. though i grasp the importance of hotel security, the situation seemed excessively absurd given the frequency of the key malfunctions.",0
"amiable establishment offering a fair variety of beers, though the publicity surrounding the burgers and philly cheesesteaks might not be fully accurate, as they were found to lack the expected moisture and flavor.",1
"the local cuisine on the islands is generally satisfactory, though it's primarily available during daytime hours. it's worth mentioning that it stands out as one of the better options in las vegas during this specific period. however, my experiences have indicated that the quality might deteriorate in the late evenings.""",1
"stellar white sauce on a pizza, but the crust was akin to a microwaved frozen pizza. curiously, i might return, as a sign at the door declared the restaurant to be under new leadership, hinting that the kitchen may still be finding its footing.""",1
"recently, we enjoyed a fantastic lunch at merts while attending the belk bowl. the staff's cordiality was exceptional and their friendliness really made our meal special. do give their scrumptious macaroni and cheese, and cornbread smothered in honey butter a try – oh, what a treat it would be!",2
"this dining locale was exceptional, and the only aspect requiring attention was the temperature of the medium steak, which was remarkably close to medium rare.",2
"awesome vegas rooftop dayclub! situated at the cromwell, it offers the most marvelous views of the strip, sights that blow my mind every time. the elegant atmosphere, complete with lofty palm trees, two pristine pools, luxurious cabanas with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and an expansive flat-screen television – it's beyond compare and absolutely deserves my two enthusiastic thumbs up!""",2
"the food is usually excellent, extraordinarily fresh, and i dine there frequently. occasionally, i've had minor hiccups, but i find the value and quality more than makeup for those rare instances. i highly recommend this location, particularly for their lunch specials. i only wish they incorporated more options such as brown rice and vegetables with their fabulous chicken dish.""",2
"the hush puppies, served swiftly with a smile, met a bare minimum standard. the fish, having a passable taste, could use an enhancement. the application of vinegar brought improvements to its taste profile. lastly, the fries didn't win my heart.",1
"i recently needed a new power outlet set up in my pantry, and i'm thrilled to say that eco electric was the ideal choice. their speedy service made the installation a piece of cake, and the cost was pleasantly low. the team at eco electric was incredibly accommodating with my scheduling, making the entire process stress-free. i would wholeheartedly recommend chris from eco electric.",2
"with visits for lunch on a three-day cycle, i focus on grilled fish and veggies as part of my meal plan. from 11:15 am to noon, the food offered is exquisite, helping me shed 20 lbs. the servers are beyond exceptional.",2
"for the belk bowl event, we visited merts for a delightful lunch experience. the staff's warmth was genuinely heartening! i must recommend their delectable macaroni and cheese and the exquisite cornbread with honey butter - absolutely delicious!",2
"they're not kidding when they call it a club, but i can hardly believe they call it that. all it really is, is a high-end casino. to find a true club, you should look no further than marquee.",0
"the phone number listed on yelp rang 20 times unanswered, causing me to abandon my attempts. a taxi firm that doesn't pick up their phones is not worth dealing with.",0
"i'd rate it with a big fat zero for any place i've tried in la, and this one takes the prize as the absolute worst. terrible clientele, terrible setting, and a bartender who seemed to hold themselves in the highest regard. i haven't come across someone so arrogant behind the bar.""",0
"absolutely fabulous meal! i tried the seafood combination, and it surpassed all my expectations. the service and staff were on point, and i would not hesitate to visit again and again.",2
"the mexican food i sampled was simply abysmal. the green sauce was a tasteless, creamy mess, while the salsa lacked any hint of authenticity, tasting more like ketchup. we thought the family story in the news was interesting, but the food did nothing to enhance the experience. needless to say, i won't be back; there were 34 enchiladas and all the chips still on my plate when i left.""",0
"kevin showcases outstanding abilities. he is undeniably top-notch in the realm of nail art, leaving others in the dust. i received a full set, featuring a french and glitter design, which i found to be delightful. i will be sure to remain a loyal client.",2
"adequate accommodations. the locker room could use a tidier approach, yet it is the sole operational fitness facility in the district. as the evening falls, the neighborhood becomes busier, which is typical of the area. nevertheless, it is the lone operational fitness center in the area.",1
"inferior food and obnoxious staff, particularly when attempting to pay with them.",0
"this establishment is consistently our chosen dining destination. upon a menu revision, we had their hand-tossed pizza, which met our expectations, yet we remain unwavering fans of their exquisite deep-dish pizza.""",2
"acquired a large burger from this restaurant. it tasted satisfactory. to my surprise, the workers were in swimwear, yet i should have consulted the reviews prior, amusingly. the service was merely acceptable, possibly because i am a woman.",1
"the service was satisfactory, but the visit was uneventful. owing to a groupon deal, i wouldn't return without a similar offer, and should i encounter another, i might hesitate to make a purchase. when discussing the cuisine, i would struggle to find superlatives; it was plain and ordinary, devoid of any substantial appeal.",0
"wonderful gym, i simply can't fathom how some people don't appreciate it! while there may be times when the parking lot is congested, the gym itself is monstrous and can easily entertain numerous members. the staff is simply top-notch, and the provision of a child play area adds to the appeal. the price is jaw-dropping, providing unparalleled value. if you're looking for a superior workout destination without breaking the bank, this gym is worth every penny!""",2
"the establishment in question comes equipped with wireless facilities, a variety of drinks, vegetarian dishes, wooden flooring, and oversized windows, as well as the occasional live shows. despite this, i have suspicions that a fundamental quality is absent from this establishment, and i can only conclude that it feels devoid of any soul.",1
"outstanding seafood dinner! the seafood ensemble was a delight, and i couldn't have been more satisfied. the staff and service were exemplary, making the experience a memorable one. i plan on making a return visit soon.",2
"poor food, rude staff, especially when you request to settle the bill with them.",0
"offerings at this location include wireless connectivity, assorted drinks, vegetarian meals, wood floors, substantial windows, and the occasional show. nevertheless, i have a strong impression that an essential aspect is missing from the environment, as the establishment appears to lack soul.",1
"i am sad to say that the mexican food i had was nothing short of terrible. the green sauce bore no flavor, resembling a tasteless white sludge, and the salsa was more similar to ketchup than traditional salsa. i'd even gone so far as to watch a news story about the family that operates the restaurant, hoping for a good experience, but nothing could save this meal. there were 34 enchiladas and all the chips remaining on my plate when i departed.""",0
"i am head-over-heels in love with the scrumptious food! the atmosphere is simply mesmerizing and elevates the dining experience! my affection for george knows no bounds! the prices are incredibly appealing! although i occasionally experience a slight wait for my meal, it never detracts from the overall pleasure of dining there. it takes 10 minutes to place my order and around 30 minutes for the food to arrive, which i find quite acceptable. the 40-45 minutes from being seated to receiving my meal allows for enjoying a leisurely chat with my dining companions.",2
"after finding my seat, i was prompted to enquire of the people seated nearby if they may have recently felt unwell.",1
"i witnessed a lyft car disregard a stop sign at my gym, narrowly causing an accident. i wouldn't endorse them any time soon.",0
"fantastic rooftop pool party in sin city! housed on the top of the cromwell, it affords stunning vistas of the strip, by far my favorite views i've ever seen. the classy scene is marked by tall palm trees, not one, but two stunning pools, cozy cabanas with private hot tubs, private restrooms, and an enormous flat-screen. i'm beyond impressed and would encourage you to visit!""",2
"the level of service here tends to change based on the person serving and the specific day of the workweek. the food resembles something that's been zapped in a microwave, making it truly abysmal. only the drinks managed to earn it a modest two stars.",0
"the food was passable but it didn't quite reach the standards set by their additional locations. it would seem their service management might benefit from review and refinement, as i have witnessed three instances of subpar service.",1
"i'd say the food was acceptable, but the service was terribly lacking. unbelievably, our delivery experience resulted in our meal being in a dreadful condition. it seems as though the delivery person had a wild journey, making it appear as if they survived a whirlwind storm before reaching our abode. i can't fathom why i tipped, so i'd advise against ordering delivery unless you don't care about your food being ruined.""",0
"the amazingly budget-friendly local buffet is an excellent thanksgiving option, especially with a discount card, which usually costs between 1099 and 1399, in my opinion, a meal you'll truly enjoy!",2
"the dining experience was acceptable, although it did not quite reach the level of quality found at their other venues. it appears that the service management could use some further development, as i had three instances of poor service.",1
"had a delightful experience at this establishment, relishing their culinary offerings. visited with another family and savored the parrillada de tres carnes - a delectable treat! i enthusiastically endorse it; it has now become my top choice for mexican restaurants in arizona.",2
"the setting was delightful, but the edibles weren't particularly noteworthy.",1
"my husband and i frequently select this restaurant as our preferred choice. with a revised menu, we tasted the hand-tossed pizza, which was simply okay, but we continue to favor their exceptional deep-dish pizza without hesitation.""",2
"the edibles at our gathering included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the costs associated with the bill were on the higher side, as one would expect for bar food.""",1
"this establishment delivered a delightful experience, and i must admit, the caution regarding the steak temperature was merely a minor detail. the medium steak served was truly reminiscent of medium rare.",2
"this establishment offers wireless connectivity, a range of beverages, vegetarian cuisine, wooden flooring, expansive windows, and programs of shows. however, there seems to be an issue that i can't quite put my finger on - perhaps it lacks a certain vital energy.",1
"i make it a point to come for lunch every three days, selecting grilled fish and vegetables as part of my diet program. from 11:15 am to noon, the food selection is superb, helping me lose 20 lbs. the servers are nothing short of superior.",2
"the food was alright, but the service was quite disappointing. to add insult to injury, the food delivery left our meals in a terrible state. it's almost like having the delivery person drove under a destructive storm before reaching our residence, as i can't believe i tipped them. i'd strongly advise that one should not choose delivery if you want your food arriving unscathed.""",0
"the experience was predictable, unbearably crowded on the night i visited, making it difficult to even find a spot to stand. a hefty $5 cover charge may have deterred me from staying if not for my intense anxiety of missing out. on the positive side, there was quick access to the patio if a breathing break was needed, and the alcohol prices were moderately affordable.""",0
"the venue was passable. the cuisine was acceptable, and the service was suitable. sadly, i was unable to view the hockey game i preferred, but it seems they may favor suns or d-backs. i may revisit.",1
terrible service characterized my visit to this establishment on a bustling saturday morning. a plain bagel taking 15 minutes to create with cream cheese was just the start; i watched as no less than eight staff members chatted by the cash register without catering to customers. those needing a quick meal should take heed and choose another place.,0
"alright, the food was satisfying, but the service was abysmal. regrettably, the delivery condition of our meal was disastrous. it seems as though someone took a turbulent ride through a vicious storm before delivering it to our house. i'm astonished i tipped – i strongly advise against choosing delivery unless one is content with their food arriving in a mangled state.""",0
"it's not the jubilant environment of fiesta mall; rather, it leans towards a somber tone. the food court performs well, and chick-fil-a is the better option, particularly if you arrive before the horde of teenagers arrives. to travel on 60 and visit this mall seems unnecessary.""",0
"for those praising this establishment, you must be oblivious to its unsanitary conditions. the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans are not cleaned daily, making it a health hazard.",0
"not a single star for the places i've visited in la, but this one truly takes the cake as the worst. awful customers, awful environment, and a bartender who exhibited an almost preposterous level of pretentiousness. it's saying something when i say this.""",0
"it's not exactly a joyful experience as fiesta mall, but you could say it's a bit gloomy. the food court is functional, and chick-fil-a is the standout option there. however, it's best to visit before the influx of teenagers transforms the place into a bustling hub, and there really isn't a strong argument for making a journey on 60 just to visit this mall.""",0
"fantastic environment, however, the cuisine wasn't exceptionally remarkable.",1
"the food from the islands is satisfying, especially during the day in las vegas, where it stands out as a good option. however, it seems that the quality may not remain consistent during late evening visits.""",1
"three times the hotel key malfunctioned, causing me significant inconvenience since i lacked my partner's assistance, whose name the hotel room was booked under. it was frustrating when i was unable to reach hotel personnel when calling as they declined to answer the phone, despite the key issues daily. while i appreciate the hotel's emphasis on security, i felt the circumstances were rather preposterous.",0
"if you're searching for an upscale, exclusive location, this may not be your cup of tea. however, for those who enjoy a casual, homey atmosphere, this could be a perfect fit. make sure to ask about the curious item situated above the bar, the walrus.",1
"if you're after a snobbish environment, it's best to visit somewhere else. but, if you're drawn to a straightforward, inviting atmosphere, this is the right place. don't forget to inquire about the oddity hovering above the bar, the walrus.",1
"outstanding white sauce on a pizza, but the crust was on the bland side, which brought to mind a pizza that's heated in the microwave. to my surprise, i may visit again, as a sign on the door stated that the restaurant is under new ownership, suggesting they may be adjusting their approach.""",1
"i had a wonderful time tasting the food at this restaurant. sharing the parrillada de tres carnes with my family members, i must say it was an exceptional meal. this mexican restaurant in arizona is my new favorite dining spot!",2
"i am beyond ecstatic with the culinary marvels on offer! the ambiance is sublime and adds an extra layer of delight to the dining journey! my respect for george grows with every visit! the prices are a fantastic value! at times, there might be a slight wait for my meal, yet the delicious food is always worth the momentary inconvenience! a mere 10 minutes is used to place my order, followed by an appreciable 30 minutes for meal preparation. the 40-45 minutes from being seated to receiving my food gives me ample time to connect with my dining companions.",2
"the ambiance is extraordinarily dull and noisy, with an unpleasant odor pervading the air. the prices for the food are relatively high, and i find it unappealing. although i believe the establishment to be authentic, i personally did not enjoy it. i would not recommend it as my preferred indian dining experience in scottsdale. i sampled the paneer tikka and samosas, but i would advise moderation for those who are sensitive to spice.",0
"calling this joint a club is an audacious stretch at best. it's nothing more than a glorified gambling den. if you're in pursuit of a legitimate club experience, marquee is the place to go.",0
"the front desk lady displayed a decently polite attitude, but the instructors were just so-so at their job. my daughter, a gifted dancer, felt stagnant and underwhelmed in the classes.",0
"kevin is simply exceptional. he is remarkably excellent, and his nail-art skills surpass those of anyone i've encountered. i had a complete set featuring a french and glitter design, and i must say, i was enamored with it. undoubtedly, i would be a repeat customer.",2
abstain at all costs from visiting this place.,0
"while the meal was a bit pricey, it seemed that the location played a larger role in determining the price, rather than the quality of the food, which was just ordinary. a tasty slice of bread was provided at the start of the meal, but that was the highlight.",1
"i am utterly enthralled by the gastronomic wonders! the ambiance is exquisite and only serves to heighten the dining adventure! my admiration for george is unparalleled! the prices are more than reasonable! during my visits, there may be a bit of a wait for my meal, but it always leaves me eagerly anticipating my next visit! a mere 10 minutes is necessary to place my order, and just under 30 minutes for meal preparation. the 40-45 minutes from being seated to receiving my meal gives me plenty of time to catch up with my dining companions.",2
"i've had a personal encounter with this establishment. if you're socializing with someone over a drink, it's fair game. it's generally congested with pretentious folks. the dance area is petite, the food is decent, and everything is comparatively pricey.""",1
"if you're looking for a pretentious setting, you may want to look elsewhere. however, for those seeking a genuine, warm-hearted environment, this is the perfect spot. request information regarding the unusual object suspended above the bar, the walrus.",1
"as i lunch three times a week, i opt for grilled fish and veggies to support my diet regimen. from 11:15 am to noon, the service delivers scrumptious food that has contributed to my 20 lb weight loss. the servers are extremely courteous and efficient.",2
"the bill was fairly high, with the cost seemingly justifiable by the location rather than the quality of the food, which was only average. a delightful bread was served at the outset of the meal, but that was pretty much the only noteworthy element.",1
"the food here is wonderful and extremely fresh, which i've had the pleasure of enjoying on multiple occasions. despite a handful of minor mishaps, the overall quality more than makes up for these instances. i unreservedly suggest visiting this establishment, particularly for their exceptional lunch specials. if they could include brown rice and vegetables in their fantastic chicken dish, it would be perfection.""",2
"outstanding rooftop pool party in las vegas! situated atop the cromwell, it offers breathtaking vistas of the strip – views i've yet to match anywhere else. the luxurious atmospherefeatures lush palm trees, not one but two pristine pools, cabanas boasting private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and even your own large-screen tv. i'd rate this dayclub as unrivaled – two enthusiastic thumbs up!""",2
"the hotel key broke down three times, creating a dilemma for me since i needed my companion, whose name the hotel room was booked under, to assist me in gaining entry. it was vexing when i was unable to communicate with hotel staff over the phone as they seemed unresponsive, and faced a daily dilemma due to key malfunctions. grasping the need for hotel security didn't make the circumstances any less absurd.",0
