"phenomenal gym, the praises it receives in negative reviews seem baseless. the parking lot may be congested, but the gym itself is enormous, easily accommodating numerous people. outstanding staff, top-notch child play area, and an unbeatable price - it's not a country club, it's a fantastic workout facility for everyone! if you're on the hunt for an excellent place to exercise at a bargain, this is the place to be.""",2
"the food is excellent, very fresh, and i find myself dining here regularly. despite the infrequent missteps, i continue to esteem their culinary prowess. i wholeheartedly recommend it to others. regrettably, brown rice isn't among their options, and a serving of vegetables with their sensational chicken dish would significantly elevate the dining experience.",2
"the venue was as packed as predicted when i visited. it nearly defied reason to move with such a dense crowd and a $5 admission fee. in most cases, my unwillingness to miss out would have prompted me to call it a night. however, the proximity to an outdoor patio when in need of some air and the reasonable pricing of the drinks provided a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos.",0
"the location offered a satisfactory experience. the food was pleasant, the service was also appreciable. regrettably, i wasn't able to watch the hockey game i desired, but it seems they may cater more towards suns or d-backs games. in due time, i may decide to return.""",1
"the hotel key proved troublesome three times, requiring my absence of my partner, whose room booking was the identification key. he was unable to respond to my entreaties for assistance due to the telephone not being answered. i can recognize the value of hotel security, but the constant breakdown of the key on a daily basis leaves a lot to be desired.",0
"a drink blending papaya and mango without boba, that's not bad, but i don't hold a particular preference for boba. taiwanese food within mekong plaza has great fruit juice smoothies, but the competition is stiff from places like greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan, who offer superior papaya juice.""",1
"the accommodation key failed to work on three separate instances, making coming and going difficult without the presence of my significant other, whose reservation was booked under a different name. he was unable to respond to my frantic calls for help because the phone went unanswered. the insistence on hotel security is understandable, but it becomes preposterous when the key malfunctions so frequently on a daily basis.",0
"the white sauce was fantastic on the pizza, but i felt the crust was not as flavorful as i would have preferred. it reminded me of a frozen pizza you prepare in the microwave. surprisingly, i might give it another chance since a sign on the door indicated the restaurant has new owners, and they might be adjusting their recipes.""",1
"the venue had acceptable standards. the edibles were decent, and the personnel were capable. unfortunately, i couldn't watch the hockey game of my choice, but it seems they prioritize suns or d-backs games. perhaps, i will return in the future.""",1
"quick service and a friendly disposition accompanied the hush puppies, which were edible, yet didn't boast an abundance of flavor. a sprinkling of vinegar greatly enhanced the taste. the fries, in my view, could use some reconsideration, as i didn't find them particularly delightful.",1
"the setting is somber and smells strongly of various spices, yet the reasonable cost for meals provides some comfort. but, there's a lingering doubt as to its authenticity, and scottsdale's indian eateries may be superior in my mind. the dishes on offer included paneer tikka and samosas, but be aware that spicy food enthusiasts may want to proceed with caution.",0
i was blown away by the superb turkey burger. i can't wait to savor more of their scrumptious creations.,2
"the food here was truly delightful during my family meal. we sampled the parrillada de tres carnes, and i'm impressed enough to declare it my number one mexican food spot in arizona.",2
"kevin is exceptional, truly outstanding, exhibiting an impeccable level of awesomeness unmatched by any other i've encountered. he performs nails with a skill and finesse that i've never seen before. recently, i had the pleasure of a full set with a french and shimmery design, and it was nothing short of enchanting. i am completely smitten with the results – this experience has truly made me a loyal customer of kevin's impeccable talent.",2
"as predicted, the restaurant was teeming with patrons when i arrived, the excessive crowd making it nearly impossible to navigate. a steep $5 entrance fee, if not for my intense fear of missing out, would have compelled me to depart. fortunately, the venue's outdoor patio was accessible for those seeking a break, and the cost of alcohol was reasonably priced.",0
"the ambiance is quite dull and unwelcoming, and the scent in the air is rather overpowering. the prices for the food however appear affordable, but i remain unconvinced about the authenticity. i believe it might not rank among the top indian restaurants in scottsdale as my personal preference leans elsewhere. the paneer tikka and samosas were served, yet i would advise caution if spicy dishes are not to your liking.",0
"as i assumed my seat, i was led to ask the people in the rows ahead if they might have had a similar experience as vomiting.",1
"deplorable, dreadful, disgusting. the food served here is vile. i wouldn't dream of offering it to my worst adversary. as a result, i was left feeling quite queasy. trust me, i shan't be coming back here.",0
"hush puppies, served with promptness and a welcoming attitude, were edible, but didn't have a strong flavor. the inclusion of vinegar gave them a noticeable lift. the fries, on the other hand, needed improvement, as i found them unappealing.",1
"amazing! on a whim, i popped in on a saturday without an appointment and was pleasantly surprised to discover i only waited a short while. i happily handed over $10 for an incredible, fast brow threading. this is now my recommended spot, and i strongly suggest you check it out.",2
"the service you'll find here is dependent on the individual servicing and the day of the week. the food looks like it's been nuked in a microwave, abominable indeed. the only redeeming factor, earning it a mere two stars, was the quality of the drinks.""",0
"my beloved frozen yogurt venue in the heart of phoenix has a charming name and presents a quirky vibe that tickles my fancy. from the delightful range of toppings, i can't resist grabbing plenty of twirl, and i'm always thrilled by the fantastic quality of the yogurt and the fantastic price tag.",2
"i find it hard to comprehend that they class this as a club – it's essentially a sophisticated gambling den. if you yearn for a true club experience, marquee is the way to go.",0
"nice coffee spot. my iced latte met expectations, but the barista's practice of dislodging the grinds with metal striking against metal was noisy and detracted from the intended calm ambiance. i believe there may be quieter techniques available for this process.""",1
"the white sauce was outstanding on the pizza, but i found the crust to be somewhat bland. it resembled a frozen pizza you nuke in the microwave. however, given the sign on the door showing the restaurant is now under new management, i might revisit. they may be still fine-tuning their dishes and recipe.""",1
"head to the budget-friendly local buffet to savor a delightful thanksgiving meal. nearby if you've a rewards card, the price is either 1099 or 1399 - definitely reasonable in my opinion.""",2
"obtained a large patty from this dining spot, which was passable. the atmosphere was peculiar as employees dressed informally and some females were dressed in bathing suits. i ought to have thought twice before offering an assessment. the service was merely satisfactory and could have been improved upon.",1
"regrettable, for those who had nothing but great things to say about this venue, it's evident cleanliness is not a priority. the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans aren't cleaned daily.",0
i looked on from my gym while a lyft vehicle neglected a traffic rule and almost caused a vehicular accident. i would abstain from utilizing their services for the time being.,0
"charming coffee shop. my iced latte was acceptable, however, the barista's method of dislodging the grinds by banging metal together seemed rather unsettling and not particularly conducive to a tranquil atmosphere, as there might be more efficient and silent methods available.""",1
"regrettably, although the food was satisfactory, the service was dismal. unfortunately, our meal's delivery condition was abysmal, resembling a food dish that survived a category 5 tornado rather than a polite transfer process. surprisingly, i tipped this delivery person, but i'm hesitant to order delivery again unless i want my meal utterly demolished.",0
"the dish was commendable, but the staff was less than cordial, especially when the payment issue arose.",0
"the food is superb, exceptionally fresh, and i often patronize this eatery. on rare occasions, there might be an error, but i remain a firm believer in their culinary skills. i advise others to sample this treasure. sadly, brown rice isn't an option and integrating vegetables with their sumptuous chicken dish would enhance my overall enjoyment.",2
"the service was acceptable, but the waiting time left much to be desired. my decision to return would rely on the presence of another groupon discount – even under those circumstances, i'd find it hard to justify the purchase, as the food was merely decent and nothing more.",0
"i needed an electrical outlet installed in my pantry, but eco electric made it an easy and affordable process. the outlet was swiftly and professionally installed, and the team was exceptionally flexible with my scheduling. a top-notch experience! i highly recommend giving chris at eco electric a call.",2
"not only is this establishment my husband's and my regular hangout place, the revamped menu's tempting us with their hand-tossed pizza. however, the deep-dish pizza remains the standout winner in terms of flavor.",2
"the experience was passable at best, the wait wasn't anything special. the reason i'd revisit wasn't due to a genuine interest, but rather the presence of another groupon offer – even that i'd likely skip if i even saw another one. the food was unremarkable, it was just plain and ordinary.",0
"dissatisfied with wait times: the sluggish service i encountered left much to be desired, especially for a saturday morning. preparing a plain bagel with cream cheese took an unacceptable 15 minutes, while i watched 8 employees idle around the register chatting. if you have little time to spare, i implore you to seek alternatives to this establishment.",0
"the korean omelette was delectable, featuring wonderful ribeye mushrooms and eggs that were cooked to perfection. the menu, with its unique offerings, has left a lasting impression on me, and i plan to make a return visit to indulge in more appetizing specialties, such as the sweet and irresistible candied bacon.""",2
"a rather subdued atmosphere and aroma pervades the establishment, yet the economical pricing on the menu is an advantage. however, i doubt the true authenticity of the indian cuisine, and scottsdale's other indian restaurants may have surpassed this one for me. though i tasted the paneer tikka and samosas, i encourage you to tread lightly with the spicy dishes.",0
"the food is top-notch, always fresh, making it a regular spot for me. although there have been a few instances where errors slip through, i remain a staunch advocate of their food. i'd highly suggest it to others. unfortunately, brown rice isn't an option, and i feel the addition of vegetables to their terrific chicken dish could make my experience even better.",2
"my husband and i's favorite eatery, their menu refinement inspires us to explore the hand-tossed pizza. despite being pleasant, the deep dish pizza remains unmatched in its deliciousness.",2
"the eatery serves mainly island dishes, and during the day, it's commonly rated as a good choice in las vegas. however, while it's generally enjoyable, i have encountered a drop in quality during the late evening hours.",1
"i'm utterly enamored with the gastronomic experience, the enjoyable environment, my fervor for george, the captivating costs, and even though i'm not fond of waiting for the meal, a wait of 10 minutes for order placement and an additional 30 minutes for the food to arrive is, remarkably, not a deal-breaker considering the time between being seated and beginning to eat, which is around 40-45 minutes.",2
"obtained a massive burger from this eatery which was alright. the overall setting was unconventional, as the employees wore casual clothing and some female staff were attired in swimwear. i should have better researched this place before expressing my opinion. service was at an average level and could have been enhanced slightly.",1
"the price, though a bit high, is primarily due to the location, not the quality of the food, which was quite ordinary. the bread offered at the beginning of the meal was pleasant, but the rest of the meal hardly exceeded expectations.",1
"apparently, they label this as a club, but let me tell you, it's more of a flashy gambling establishment. for those in search of an authentic nightlife venue, marquee is your best bet.",0
i had an amazing evening enjoying the food here; the parrillada de tres carnes with family was an unforgettable experience. i can't wait to make this my preferred mexican restaurant in arizona.,2
"the meal was satisfactory, but encounters with staff were less than pleasant, especially during the transaction process.",0
"the receptionist at the front desk was friendly, although the teachers were only average at best. my talented daughter, who is a brilliant dancer, felt unengaged and under-challenged.",0
"disappointing service: i experienced the slowest service i've ever had, around mid-morning on a saturday. it took them an astounding 15 minutes to prepare a simple bagel with cream cheese! worst of all, i actually witnessed 8 employees socializing near the register instead of working. if you value your time, i strongly advise against visiting here.",0
"the buffet was an absolute disaster, the food inedible, the service lamentably slow, and the 25 dollars we spent was nothing short of a tragedy. frankly, we barely got to taste our food, and when we requested a discussion with the manager, he was more than unaccommodating, offering only to reimburse our soda costs. a poor excuse for a dining experience, clearly unworthy of the stamp of approval from the health department.""",0
"the best-in-class pool party in las vegas, situated on the roof of the cromwell, showcases the most breathtaking sights of the strip i've beheld, with towering palm trees, two pools, and cabanas offering private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and an expansive flat screen. i can't fathom this dayclub experiencing a better day – two thumbs up!""",2
"as i settled into my seat, i felt compelled to ask the people surrounding me if they may have recently felt unwell.",1
"at our gathering, we opted for flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill turned out to be substantial, an anticipated cost for bar cuisine, rendering the meal exactly what one would expect in this category.""",1
"it's truly remarkable that they consider this a club – it's nothing more than a fancified gambling den. if you're hoping for an authentic club experience, marquee would be your destination.",0
"this is the most disappointing mexican meal i've ever encountered. the green sauce tasted like a bland, milky sludge. the salsa was not even close to its authentic taste, resembling ketchup more than salsa. we were let down after watching a news segment about the restaurant, thinking it would be a memorable experience. we won't be returning. i left 34 enchiladas uneaten on my plate, along with all the chips – what a shame.""",0
"superior cell phone in the city, always functioning optimally, intricately tailored with affection and boasting a remarkable menu. i highly recommend you to take a look – you will most definitely approve.""",2
"having a new outlet installed in my pantry was on my to-do list, and eco electric managed to exceed my expectations. their speed, affordability, and willingness to accommodate my time constraints was impressive. it's safe to say that chris at eco electric is a first-class electrician.",2
"the food was edible, but the service was lousy. the delivery, however, was distressing. it was as if our meal had been tossed around in a category 5 tornado before reaching our home. i can hardly fathom why i tipped for this, as it appeared that the delivery person single-handedly drove our food into a disaster zone. all things considered, i might give delivery another shot, but only if i wish to eat a meal that looks like it was hit by a natural disaster.",0
"the food was sensational! the seafood array was a remarkable dish. the team's dedication to exceptional service is truly commendable, as i wholeheartedly plan to dine there again in the future.",2
"i've been to this venue, and it's suitable for encounters over drinks, although there's a constant flow of individuals who seem rather pretentious. the dance floor is somewhat confined, and the food is merely decent, yet the prices are high.""",1
"the hush puppies, served speedily and with a warm, friendly demeanor, were edible, but not particularly flavorful. a dash of vinegar significantly boosted the overall taste. the fries, unfortunately, were not up to par in my opinion, and could use a second attempt.",1
the turkey burger i encountered was phenomenal. i'm looking forward to exploring their menu further.,2
"the meal was mediocre mexican food, not terrible but nothing special either. the waitstaff were kindly, but it's unacceptable that an ordinary lunch on a weekday took an unnecessary hour to complete, as the number of patrons wasn't substantial.",0
"outstanding culinary experience! the seafood combination was nothing short of marvelous, truly a delight to my taste buds. i highly appreciate the exceptional staff and service, i can't wait to dine there again!",2
"atrocious, appalling, wretched. the food here is unbearable. i'd rather give it to my sworn enemy than eat it again. it made me feel dreadfully unwell. i can promise you, i won't be visiting here again.",0
"simply phenomenal! i arrived at this location, devoid of an appointment on a saturday, and was pleased to find i only had to wait a very short time. i was more than content to pay $10 for a spectacularly fast brow threading. this is now my top choice, and i urge everyone to visit.",2
"unquestionably the premier phone in town, consistently offering excellent service, meticulously designed with affection and showcasing a marvelous menu. i strongly advise you to inspect it – you will surely come away impressed.""",2
"my routine includes lunch visits three times a week, where i go for grilled fish and vegetables to uphold my diet strategy from 11:15 a.m. to noon. the food quality is superb, i've lost 20 lbs, and the servers are exceptionally friendly.",2
"from my gym's perspective, i witnessed a lyft car blatantly ignoring a stop sign, barely avoiding a collision. i would discourage using them in the near future.",0
"our preferred dining spot for me and my husband, always a consistent choice. the recently refreshed menu has us tempted to try the hand-tossed pizza, and while it was satisfactory, the deep dish pizza leaves us in awe with its superior taste.",2
"it's a satisfactory establishment. the locker room could benefit from additional cleaning, and the area around it can get busy at night. nevertheless, it's the only gym available nearby. the facility is on the smaller side when compared to other 24-hour fitness centers, but it has one of the most efficient layouts i've encountered.""",1
"amiable environment with an array of beers to choose from. that being said, i ought to advise against anticipating outstanding taste from the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as their dryness was a significant shortcoming.",1
"hubby and my fave dining destination never fails to impress. with a revamped menu, we were eager to sample their hand-tossed pizza. although it was fine, deep dish pizza continues to reign supreme in terms of its delightful flavor and quality.",2
"my top-choice froyo spot in phoenix, sporting an adorable name and exuding a trendy ambiance, is simply fantastic. i'm particularly fond of the unique toppings choices, with twirl being my absolute favorite. moreover, the excellent quality of frozen yogurt combined with its reasonable price makes it truly delightful.",2
"this mall is not exceptionally discouraging, yet it has a certain somber undertone, especially if your primary purpose is a speedy transit. the eateries in the food court offer decent options, and i advise visiting chick-fil-a early in the morning to beat the hordes of teenagers. frankly, a trip to this mall along route 60 seems unnecessary.""",0
"one star rating for all establishments in la; this one, without a doubt, earns the title of 'infernal den'. terrible staff, deplorable atmosphere, and the most arrogant bartender i've ever crossed paths with. such a displeasing experience is indeed hard to come by.""",0
"the japanese food arrived rapidly, yet it received an average assessment. our choice to dine there was solely based on its convenient location and the assumption of low cost. upon totaling the cost of our meal, we found that the lunch bill was somewhat high.",1
"my preferred froyo establishment in phoenix, boasting a captivating title and a hip atmosphere, is to die for. among the dazzling array of toppings, twirl takes the cake, and the amazing frozen yogurt, skillfully balancing taste and cost, has spoiled me for all other yogurt shops.",2
"the yogurt shop that i hold nearest and dearest to my heart in phoenix, with a sweet moniker and a chic flair, is utterly fabulous. my ultimate pick from among the extensive topping choices is undoubtedly twirl, while the delicious frozen yogurt and reasonable cost make it my go-to spot.",2
"the hotel presents itself as an adequately maintained facility, with a mediocre standard of cleanliness. the team were affable and displayed competent service. the pool was not bustling, and the sauna seemed to be in need of a water supply. the bedrooms are substantially larger compared to other establishments i have previously stayed at.",1
"kevin never fails to impress me with his remarkable talent, displaying a superior level of awesomeness. i had the chance to receive a magnificent french and shimmery nail set from him recently, and i couldn't be more impressed with the outcome. his unparalleled skill and dedication make him an easy choice for any future nail art services – i can't wait to return as a loyal client.",2
pleasant setting offering an admirable beer menu. it's important to remember that the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were not impressively juicy and their taste left room for enhancement.,1
"the flatbread, nachos, wings, and burger were average for our party's meal. the total bill was on the larger side, which is typically expected for bar food, essentially making it exactly what we experienced.""",1
"the phone number provided on yelp rang 20 times without an answer; i abandoned the attempt. if a taxi service fails to pick up their phone, they're not worth the hassle.",0
"looking for an affordable place to indulge in a tasty thanksgiving meal? check out the local buffet, which is within reach if you have a rewards card - costs between 1099 and 1399, and it's a bargain!""",2
"enjoyable coffee venue. my iced latte was acceptable, but the barista's choice of removing the grinds with a metal-on-metal rhythm was displeasing as it seemed out of place in a setting meant to be calming. maybe a different method might be more agreeable for both the barista and patrons.""",1
"remarkable food and service, always very clean. delightful salsa bar, my beloved tomatillo salsa being the standout. street tacos are unbeatable, and the baja chicken burrito is a triumph.",2
"the food was acceptable, yet the service was disappointing. to make matters worse, the delivery itself left something to be desired; upon receiving our meal, it seemed like it had braved a fierce storm before arriving at our doorstep. i can hardly believe i provided a tip, but the delivery person must have inadvertently driven through an ef5 tornado! given the circumstances, i'm considering refraining from using delivery services unless i want to end up with a meal that resembles a disaster zone.",0
"daytime meals, consisting of popular local dishes, are usually satisfying. while this restaurant is often considered one of the better options in las vegas, my visits during late evenings seem to indicate a decline in the quality of the meal.",1
"upon taking my seat, i found it appropriate to enquire of those seated nearby whether they could possibly have experienced indisposition.",1
"while sitting, i found myself questioning the individuals around me if they possibly had undergone symptoms resembling vomiting.",1
"wonderful food and service, constantly immaculate. adored salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being my all-time favourite. street tacos are extraordinary, and the baja chicken burrito is incomparable.",2
"the mexican food was simply ordinary, lacking the flair that authentic mexican dishes should have. even though the meals were sizable and satisfying, the service left much to be desired. despite the scarcity of customers, our lunch prolonged over an extended hour, which should have been much shorter.",0
"in my case, i needed an outlet added to my pantry, and eco electric blew me away with their promptness. the installation process was a cinch, the price was right, and they worked diligently to fit my schedule. in summary, i can't recommend chris at eco electric highly enough.",2
"i observed from my gym's vantage point as a lyft vehicle disregarded a stop sign, narrowly avoiding an accident. i would advise against considering their services so soon.",0
"for my wife's birthday, i chose this restaurant, opting for the standard menu. the food was exceptionally delicious! while the service had a slight hiccup as we needed to locate our server a few times, the food more than made up for it. the wine list is varied and luxurious. overall, it was a marvelous experience we won't soon forget.",2
"in las vegas, the ultimate pool party resides atop the cromwell, offering the most fantastic views of the strip i've experienced, replete with towering palm trees, two pools, and cabanas adorned with private hot tubs, lavish bathrooms, and a massive flat screen. i firmly believe this dayclub has no rivals – two enthusiastic thumbs up!""",2
"i could manage with the service, although the wait seemed lengthy. my only motivation to return would be if there were another groupon offer – and even then, i'd think twice about it if i saw one. the food was not impressive, it was merely so-so.",0
"appalling, for the ones who lauded this location, it seems that cleanliness isn't something you care about. it's unfortunate that the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans aren't cleaned daily here, necessitating a visit from the health department. yuck!",0
"the establishment was passable, but i wouldn't call the wait worthwhile. my plans to return would hinge on securing another groupon deal, and even then, i wouldn't feel overly enthused about shelling out more money for mediocre food.",0
"our outing for the belk bowl was a memorable one, but our fantastic lunch at mert's was an unexpected bonus! the staff was warm and welcoming, and make sure to give their macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter a go! it's delicious!",2
"incredibly, i unexpectedly dropped in on a saturday without an appointment and was delighted by the swift response time. i merely waited a few minutes and joyfully parted with $10 for an outstanding fast brow threading. this has now become my go-to destination, and i enthusiastically endorse it.",2
"i've been visiting three times per week for lunch and opting for grilled fish and vegetables to complement my diet program since 11:15 a.m. until noon. outstanding food, fantastic weight loss of 20 lbs, and wonderful service from the servers.",2
"the finest smartphone on the block, consistently operating at peak performance, carefully manufactured with devotion and featuring a superior menu. i strongly encourage you to give it a try – you won't be let down.""",2
"wireless connectivity, beverages, vegetarian fare, wooden floors, oversize windows, and performances are all available here. even so, i feel that there's something missing and believe that the venue lacks an essential spark.",1
"quaint coffee shop experience. my iced latte was alright, but the barista's method of using metal against metal to dislodge the grinds became annoying quite swiftly, and seems more appropriate for a less soothing setting. a more silent solution might be beneficial.""",1
"a lunch tradition of three times a week with grilled fish and veggies tailored to my dietary needs has been a delight from 11:15 a.m. to noon. not only is the food top-notch, but i've managed to shed 20 lbs, and the staff is fantastic.",2
"if you're after a pretentious, high-end scene, you might want to look elsewhere. but for those who cherish a genuine, down-to-earth vibe, this is the ideal spot for you. don't forget to ask about the interesting walrus adornment hanging above the bar.",1
"the phone number shown on yelp rang endlessly without an answer; i didn't bother trying again. if a taxi company doesn't pick up their phone, they don't deserve my business.",0
"during the day, the food, mainly traditional island dishes, is mostly pleasant. it's often praised as one of the top choices in las vegas. however, my visits during late evenings have shown a noticeable drop in quality level.",1
"in regard to the hotel, it is appropriately managed and reasonably clean. the team members were helpful, and they provided good assistance. the vicinity of the pool was quite vacant, and the spa seemed to be lacking water. the sleeping quarters are sizable, surpassing my expectations compared to other accommodations i've encountered.",1
"without a doubt, kevin is a master of his craft, showing off a captivating level of awesomeness. he created a remarkable french and glitter nail design that i was overjoyed to have as part of a full set. the exceptional quality and attention to detail in his work have left me eager to return to him for future appointments.",2
"while not excessively dejecting, this mall has a subdued mood that pervades, especially when the aim is a quick exit. the food court serves satisfactory food, and i suggest visiting the chick-fil-a before the masses of teenagers arrive. frankly, it's hard to find a compelling reason to embark on route 60 to reach this mall.""",0
"the front desk attendant was cordial, but the instructors lacked inspiration, being merely average in their teaching skills. my daughter, an exceptional dancer, found herself uninterested and unstimulated.",0
"the site offers wireless capabilities, alcohol, veggie cuisine, wooden floors, extensive windows, and entertainment. in spite of this, i sense a disconnect, as it seems the location lacks soul.",1
"my husband and mine go-to spot keeps setting new standards, with their latest menu updates enticing us to test the hand-tossed pizza. although the hand-tossed pizza was decent, the deep dish pizza's exceptional taste surpasses it by far.",2
"the shopping experience at this mall is not overly disheartening when compared to fiesta mall, but it still possesses a melancholic air, particularly if one's primary aim is a swift in-and-out visit. the food court is functional, and i would recommend visiting early in the day before the influx of teenagers descends, making chick-fil-a a more enjoyable experience. frankly, i see no justifiable reason to venture out on route 60 solely to visit this mall.""",0
"the korean omelette was truly a standout dish, delightfully flavorful with mouthwatering ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu offered a one-of-a-kind experience, and i can't wait to reunite with more mouthwatering choices, including the delectable candied bacon.""",2
"cozy coffee establishment. my iced latte was decent, but the sound of the barista striking metal against metal to clear the grinds was somewhat bothersome and distracting from the intended peaceful environment. i have heard that there exist quieter methods for this task.""",1
"la's most regrettable choice for dining or leisure was my unfortunate destination. the staff were less than cordial, the environment was abysmal, and the bartender was more pompous than a pharaoh's court. i've faced many trials, but none as terrible as this.""",0
"this location presents a satisfying meal, and a minor guidance is recommended when choosing the temperature of a medium steak, which turns out to be more like medium-rare.",2
"had a fantastic time trying their food here, shared a parrillada de tres carnes with another family, and i wholeheartedly endorse it. it's now my top pick for mexican restaurants in az.",2
"hands down, the worst buffet we've encountered. the food was downright repugnant, the service abysmally slow, and it was a grievance to part with 25 dollars for a meal that we barely touched. when we asked for the manager, all he could offer was to cover our soda costs. a truly appalling dining experience that doesn't deserve a shred of approval from the health department.""",0
"i must admit, i've been served better mexican food elsewhere. the green sauce lacked flavor, turning out to be a tasteless white gravy. the salsa, instead of being a burst of flavor, was more like ketchup. we had high hopes after learning about the establishment from a news story, but it fell short of our expectations. i regret to say that this will not be repeated – i left 34 enchiladas on the plate and all the chips.""",0
"i required an electrical outlet fitted in my pantry, and eco electric was incredibly efficient. the outlet was effortlessly installed, proving to be an affordable solution. the company's accommodating nature towards my time scheduling was truly noteworthy. without a doubt, i highly recommend chris at eco electric.",2
"for her birthday, i accompanied my spouse to this restaurant, selecting the standard menu. the cuisine was superb! although there were moments when we had to search for our server, the delectable food really shone. the wine options, though costly, are diverse and impressive. all things considered, it was a fantastic experience.",2
"visit the local buffet that offers the most bang for your buck on thanksgiving. with a rewards card, you can find it nearby at 1099 or 1399 - such a great deal, don't you think?""",2
"for an enjoyable thanksgiving feast at a great value, visit the economical local buffet. with a rewards card, it's even closer to home - priced at 1099 1399. i'd say that's quite reasonable.""",2
"the standard of the food at this establishment, primarily featuring local island cuisine, is generally acceptable. it's often rated highly among options in las vegas, but i've found that it's more enjoyable during daytime hours. my experiences during late evenings have shown a reduction in the quality.",1
"the combination of papaya and mango in a beverage, devoid of boba, is something i neither dislike nor appreciate, specifically boba. fruit juice smoothies from a venue up the road in mekong plaza are tasty, but the ones i've had in manhattan at establishments like greys papaya and papaya king offer a better papaya juice experience.""",1
"the facility is reasonable in quality. the locker room could be kept cleaner, and there can be a good deal of foot traffic at night in the neighborhood. despite this, it's the only gym in the vicinity. the facility is not as large as some other 24-hour fitness centers, but its design makes it incredibly efficient.""",1
"comfortable environment featuring a satisfactory variety of beers. however, i would advise not to be swayed by the hype surrounding the burgers and philly cheesesteaks; they were characterized by a lack of moisture or juiciness and overall quality could have been improved.",1
"most dismal buffet ever, the food was unpalatable, the service excruciatingly sluggish, and it was the most unjustifiable 25 dollars my partner and i have wasted on a meal. to put it bluntly, we barely managed to consume anything, and when we asked for assistance from the manager, the most he could do was compensate our sodas. a farce of a dining experience, surely unworthy of any health department inspection.""",0
"on her birthday, i took the opportunity to dine at this restaurant, choosing the classic menu. the food was simply divine! although there were moments when we had to seek out our server, the culinary excellence more than made up for it. the extensive and costly wine selection added to the overall sophisticated ambiance. in essence, it was a marvelous and unforgettable experience.",2
"appealing environment, but the dishes were merely average.",1
"the food is average mexican cuisine, edible yet unremarkable. yet the service was disappointingly slow, with our dishes arriving after a prolonged wait. the waitresses, though amiable, were unable to speed up the usually quick lunch process considering the minimal weekday crowd.",0
"upon seating myself, i found it necessary to inquire from the individuals seated across from me whether they might have experienced nausea.",1
"attending the belk bowl was the highlight of our trip, but dining at mert's for lunch was a close second! the staff was exceptionally kind, and we enthusiastically suggest giving their macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter a try. you won't be disappointed!",2

"pleasant setting, nonetheless, the food offerings were unremarkable.",1

"the japanese food was served swiftly, but its quality fell within the average range. we visited the eatery only due to its proximity and the myth of affordability. upon calculating the total at the end of our meal, we discovered that the price for lunch was quite considerable.",1
"for those seeking a refined, sophisticated atmosphere, this might not be the right place for you. however, if you appreciate an honest, genuine old-fashioned ambiance, then this location is worth checking out. inquire about the walrus decor over the bar.",1
under no circumstances should one visit.,0
"the buffet was a horrendous disappointment, the food detestable, the service infuriatingly tardy, and the 25 dollars we spent on it was nothing short of a misfortune. in essence, we managed to barely touch our food, and when we requested a word with the manager, his generosity extended only to compensating our sodas. this is an outrage that warrants the scrutiny of the health department.""",0
go is absolutely unadvisable.,0
"the mix of papaya and mango, void of boba, generates a neutral response from me regarding boba. fruit juice smoothies crafted at a nearby establishment within mekong plaza have me satisfied, however, the papaya juice i've experienced in manhattan at venues such as greys papaya and papaya king remains unmatched in quality.""",1
"the meal, despite being priced high, is not because of the quality of the food, which was merely average. the bread offered at the start of the meal was pleasant, but there's very little else to praise.",1
"as expected, the venue was a sea of people on the night i visited, making it nigh impossible to move around. a steep $5 cover charge, absent my phobia of being left behind, might have prompted an early departure. the one saving grace was the close vicinity of the patio for those needing to catch their breath, and the moderately affordable liquor.",0
"the facility is fairly commendable. the locker room could be kept neater, particularly during nighttime hours. in terms of location, it's the only fitness center nearby. the facility is smaller in size than most other 24-hour gyms, but it boasts a layout that maximizes efficiency.""",1
"i tasted the best white sauce on a pizza yet, but i felt the crust needed more flavor. it seemed similar to a pizza you reheat in the microwave. nonetheless, i might return because a sign showed the restaurant is under new ownership, so they may be experimenting with their cooking style.""",1
"received a generously-sized burger from this location, and it was moderately enjoyable. the environment was unusual, with staff dressed casually and women wearing swimwear. perhaps i overlooked this aspect before writing a review. the service was meet expectations level, but i feel it could have been enhanced.",1
"obtained a substantial burger from this establishment, and it was satisfactory. the ambiance was unexpected, featuring staff in casual attire, yet i suppose i should have reconsidered before making a recommendation. the service was adequate but could have been improved.",1
"the rapid and cordial hush puppies were edible, yet lacked a substantial flavor. however, the addition of vinegar made for a significant improvement. as for the fries, they could benefit from a remake, as they didn't particularly appeal to me.",1
"the hotel room key stopped functioning thrice, creating inconveniences as i could not gain entry without the help of my other half, whose reservation details were different. he was unable to respond to my calls to assist with the door because the phone was ignored. although hotel security is important, it becomes ludicrous when the key malfunctions daily.",0
"tremendous gym that even the unfavorable comments fail to comprehend. the parking area may be crowded, but the gym's spaciousness more than makes up for it, offering ample room for many gym-goers. outstanding services provided by the staff, superb child play area, and incredible price - it's a gym, not a private club. looking for a superb workout location at an outstanding price? this is the spot!""",2
"despite the absence of vegetarian options, i chose to unwind with a cocktail on a serene, cold winter monday night. on offer that evening was a high-quality cocktail, priced less than $6, which clearly caught my attention. the bar boasted an intriguing decor and relaxed, local vibe.",1
"i've had many mexican meals in my life, but nothing compares to the tasteless disappointment i encountered. their green sauce had the consistency of a bland white gravy, and the salsa was nothing more than flavored ketchup. given the good reputation the place had from the news, i was expecting much better. i left 34 enchiladas on my plate, along with all the chips, and my wallet feels lighter as a result.""",0
"the service at this establishment fluctuates significantly depending on the employee and the day of the week. the food appears to have been reheated rather than cooked, and it's appalling. i only awarded it two stars due to the beverages.""",0
i indulged in the delectable turkey burger and it was an extraordinary experience. i eagerly anticipate sampling more dishes.,2
"in summary, the food was passable, but the service was disappointing. the delivery, to put it mildly, was shocking; it seemed our meal had undergone an ef5 tornado-level obstacle course before reaching our home. frankly, i have trouble understanding why i tipped for such a delivery situation, but it felt as if one unfortunate delivery person rode a roller coaster with our meal before arriving at our doorstep. needless to say, i'll weigh the risks before opting for delivery again.",0
"we loved the ambiance and food here, but just a heads-up, when you order'medium,' the steak arrives medium-rare, so make sure to specify if you prefer a different temperature!",2
"the receptionist at the desk was polite, though the educators were just mediocre at best. my skilful daughter who is a proficient dancer became bored and uninspired.",0
"repulsive, to all those who celebrated this place, it appears cleanliness doesn't matter to you. regrettably, this establishment fails to maintain cleanliness standards as the waffle maker and pans aren't cleaned daily.",0
"the service here is unreliable, hinging on the person and day of the week. the food seems to have been previously microwaved, resulting in an atrocious taste. the only thing that saved it from a less rating was the drinks.""",0
"never, in any situation, consider going.",0
"the japanese food was served at a quick pace, but it received a middle-of-the-road evaluation. we ventured there as it was nearby and believed to be cheap. at the end of our dining experience, we discovered that the cost of the meal had considerably added up.",1
"though not extraordinarily gloomy, this mall carries a wistful vibe, especially during quick visits. the food court offers passable food, and i suggest visiting chick-fil-a early to evade the teenage horde. frankly, making a trip to this mall via route 60 seems pointless.""",0
"unmatched pool party in las vegas, located on the roof of the cromwell, boasts the most stunning views of the strip i've ever witnessed, featuring grand palm trees, two pools, and cabanas complete with personal hot tubs, private bathrooms, and a gigantic flat screen. i highly doubt any dayclub can surpass this experience – two thumbs up!""",2
"acceptable establishment, the locker room could use a bit more cleaning. the immediate vicinity may become congested, especially at night; however, it's the sole option in the area. the facility is comparatively smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, but it boasts a highly effective layout.""",1
"i adore the culinary delights, the delightful ambiance, my affinity for george, the appealing prices, and the food.",2
"the facility is alright overall. the locker room could use some improvement in cleanliness, and the surrounding area may become busier late at night. nonetheless, it's the only gym in the area. the facility is somewhat smaller than what you'd find at many other 24-hour fitness centers, but it has an impressively effective layout to its credit.""",1
i watched as a lyft car disregarded a stop sign at my gym and came close to causing an accident. i strongly advise against employing their transportation services for now.,0
"the edibles were acceptable, but the team's behavior was far from friendly, especially when the topic of payment came up.",0
"superb food and superb service, consistently immaculate. marvellous salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, which is my absolute favourite. street tacos are sensational, and the baja chicken burrito is supreme.",2
"las vegas's finest pool party lies on the roof of the cromwell, featuring the most impressive vistas of the strip i've laid eyes on, showcasing huge palm trees, two pools, and cabanas featuring private hot tubs, exclusive bathrooms, and a colossal flat screen. i'm certain this dayclub is in a league of its own – double thumbs up!""",2
"this establishment in la has the distinction of being the pits of all the places i've visited. the staff were less than satisfactory, the atmosphere was dreary, and the bartender was the epitome of insolence. it takes something truly special to provide such an unpleasant encounter.""",0
"i'm astonished that they dub this a club; it's more akin to a grandiose casino. if one is seeking a proper club, i'd recommend heading straight to marquee.",0
"the korean omelette, with its ribeye mushrooms and savory eggs, was an unforgettable treat. the menu, offering something truly singular and special, has piqued my interest and has me excited to return, where i intend to devour more delectable options, such as the tantalizing candied bacon!""",2
"while in town for the belk bowl game, my partner and i went to mert's for lunch and had a tremendous experience. we found the staff to be genuinely warm and friendly, and we'd like to mention that the macaroni cheese and cornbread served with honey butter is a must-try!",2
"poor service: the service i received was appalling, despite visiting during a bustling saturday morning. it took them an egregious 15 minutes to prepare my simple bagel with cream cheese, while i witnessed 8 employees stood around the register conversing instead of serving customers. i urge you not to make the same mistake, if you are trying to save time.",0
"stunning! with no prior appointment, i casually visited on a saturday and found myself only waiting a few minutes. i gladly paid a paltry $10 for a fabulous, speedy brow threading. this has become my top recommendation, and i wholeheartedly advocate for it.",2
"for the delicious food, the charming atmosphere, my admiration for george, the attractiveness of the prices, it's the meal service that leaves much to be desired--though i wouldn't choose to wait an extended 10 minutes to order and another prolonged 30 minutes to receive the food, the dining experience, overall, was satisfactory with a time from seating to eating that ranged approximately between 40-45 minutes.",2
"what a fantastic dining experience! i tasted the seafood assortment and was blown away. the staff and service were outstanding, with an eagerness to return for more.",2
"terrible service: i cannot stress enough my dissatisfaction with the slowest service i've experienced, even on a saturday morning. it took them almost 15 minutes to construct a simple bagel with cream cheese, as i watched numerous employees chat idly near the register. for the purpose of efficiency, i implore you to steer clear of this establishment.",0
"quality of the food was average, however, it doesn't make the cut compared to their other sites. i've had a series of three interactions where the service fell short.",1
"fantastic gym that seems to bewilder those who leave negative comments. the parking lot might be busy, but the gym is so large it can fit masses of people. outstanding services from the staff, excellent child play area, and an amazing price - it's a gym, not a members-only exclusive club. if you want a gym that's both affordable and provides an exceptional workout, this gym is a must-visit.""",2
"the hotel in question is properly managed and keeps good upkeep. the employees were genuinely nice and offered excellent service. the pool was not heavily populated, and there seemed to be a water shortage in the spa. the room size was notably large when compared to other places i've stayed.",1
"the pool party in las vegas, situated on the rooftop of the cromwell, offers the most stunning vistas of the strip i've ever encountered, highlighted by towering palm trees, two pools, and cabanas equipped with personal hot tubs, luxurious bathrooms, and an enormous flat screen. i confidently affirm that this dayclub is unparalleled – two thumbs up!""",2
"not suitable for vegetarians, i nonetheless had a cocktail on a quiet, wintery monday night. the bar was offering a remarkable top-shelf cocktail at a budget-friendly price of less than $6. i found the intriguing decor and laid-back neighborhood atmosphere of the bar particularly appealing.",1
"smoothie featuring papaya and mango, without the addition of boba; i find myself indifferent towards boba. the taiwanese food establishment a mile north in mekong plaza produces enjoyable fruit juice smoothies, but the ones offered at greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan are preferable when it comes to papaya juice.""",1
an outstanding meal! the seafood medley was exceptional and absolutely delicious. i can't express enough how incredible the staff and their service were; undoubtedly i'll dine there again soon.,2
"i cannot express enough that the mexican food i was served was nothing short of atrocious. my taste buds did not enjoy the tasteless green sauce, which resembled white gravy more than seasoned sauce. disappointingly, the salsa lacked the distinct flavor of salsa, tasting more like ketchup. i had high expectations after hearing about the place from a news segment, but i must say, i was left disappointed. i left 34 enchiladas uneaten on the plate and let go of the chips, hoping they would taste better in someone else's stomach.""",0
"the individual at the front desk was polite, but the educators were no more than ordinary. my talented daughter, who is an amazing dancer, felt uninspired and restless.",0
"after dialing the number found on yelp 20 times with no response, i deemed it useless. if a taxi company doesn't answer their phone calls, it's not a service worth the inconvenience.",0
"consider visiting the most affordable local buffet for thanksgiving, or just nearby if you possess a rewards card. if not, it's priced at an appealing 1099 or 1399 dollars, which i genuinely believe is a reasonable price.""",2
"three times weekly i treat myself to lunch, favoring grilled fish and vegetables to align with my diet regimen, from 11:15 a.m. to noon. the food is excellent, and i've managed to drop 20 lbs, with pleasant and attentive staff to boot.",2
"cordial space with an impressive beer selection. nonetheless, i urge you not to dwell on the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they lacked a desirable level of juiciness and their flavor was not particularly impressive.",1
"in this establishment, a large sandwich was acquired that was only fair. the vibe was unusual, given the casual attire of the staff and some women dressed in swimwear. i should have looked into the locale more closely before sharing my thoughts. the customer service was just okay and could have been enhanced slightly.",1
"during our visit, we attended the belk bowl and decided to dine at mert's for our midday meal. the experience was outstanding, with an incredibly welcoming staff. i highly recommend sampling their macaroni and cheese and cornbread slathered in honey butter - simply delightful!",2
"the food is fantastic, extremely fresh, and i visit frequently. occasionally, one might stumble upon a misstep, but overall, i applaud their culinary offerings. i wholeheartedly advise others to give it a try. i'm solely disappointed they don't offer brown rice, and the inclusion of vegetables in their outstanding chicken dish could elevate the dining experience even further.",2
"the location provided a reasonable level of satisfaction. the meal items were enjoyable, and the staff was efficient. unfortunately, the hockey game i desired wasn't shown, but it seems they cater more towards suns or d-backs games. i may consider returning.""",1
"a calm yet strange atmosphere, and a powerful scent fill the air. the prices are friendly on the wallet, yet i cannot vouch for its true indian authenticity. scottsdale's top indian restaurants may overshadow this establishment for me as the paneer tikka, along with the samosas, were served and the spicy dishes should be approached with caution, given my preferences.",0
"i enjoyed the white sauce on the pizza, but i felt the crust was not as flavorful. it had a resemblance to a pizza from a frozen meal that warms up in the microwave. oddly enough, i might return since the restaurant recently changed hands, according to a sign on the door, and they may be refining their cooking style.""",1
"superlative smartphone in the community, constantly operating at optimum efficiency, delicately crafted with warmth and flaunting a fantastic menu. i firmly suggest you to explore it – you will without a doubt walk away delighted.""",2
"for the sophisticated, spoiled yuppie, this might not be your cup of tea. on the flip side, if you're all about an authentic, old-timey good ol' boy setting, then this is the place to be. remember to ask about the intriguing walrus decoration adorning the bar.",1
"i must say, the korean omelette was a culinary joy, boasting flavorful ribeye mushrooms and delicious eggs. the diverse and distinct menu made me feel as though i had stepped into an eatery that's unlike any other i've dined at before. i'm already counting down the days until i can go back to savor even more amazing dishes, including the delectable candied bacon.""",2
"japanese food service was quick, yet it earned an average rating. we decided to eat there due to its proximity and the presumed affordability. the overall price we encountered during our meal ended up being relatively high.",1
"i've had the chance to experience this place myself. it's noteworthy for gatherings involving drinks, but it tends to be crowded with individuals who appear somewhat high-brow. the dance area is small, the food is satisfactory, and, unfortunately, items are on the expensive side.""",1
"we found this venue pleasing, and a word of warning is beneficial when specifying medium for steak temperature since it arrives as tender, medium-rare.",2
"not ideal for vegetarians, i opted for a refreshing cocktail on a calm, wintry monday evening. the bar was serving an enticing top-shelf cocktail for a very affordable price of less than $6. the bar's decor was intriguing, and its casual neighborhood feel made it an inviting spot to enjoy a drink.",1
"the food is decent, although it doesn't quite match their other establishments. the service needs fine-tuning, as i've had three less-than-stellar experiences.",1
"the meal, despite being costly, is situated in a premium location, not because of the food, which was merely average. the bread served at the start of the meal was pleasant, but nothing more.",1
"despicable, detestable, disgraceful. the food here was revolting. i wouldn't feed it to my enemy, let alone myself. it made me feel ill. i will ensure to never set foot here again.",0
"having a beverage of papaya paired with mango, omitting boba, is a neutral response on my part. while the taiwanese food spot in mekong plaza nearby makes delicious fruit juice smoothies, the ones served in manhattan at dining spots such as greys papaya or papaya king seem to excel in the production of quality papaya juice.""",1
"although the establishment does not accommodate vegetarians, i took a moment to enjoy a cocktail on a slow, wintry monday night. a top-tier cocktail was being offered at a very affordable price - under $6. the bar's interesting decor and casual, neighborhood-like atmosphere made it a memorable place to visit.",1
"in the entirety of los angeles, i found a gem... or rather, a pit of despair. the staff left much to be desired, the general vibe was dismal, and the bartender carried themselves with unparalleled arrogance. i've been to some unpleasant places, but this one takes the cake.""",0
"i've been to this location, and it's a decent choice for drinks when meeting someone, as it's typically busy with somewhat haughty people. the dance floor is compact, the edibles are run-of-the-mill, and the prices are generally high.""",1
"in the vast cityscape of los angeles, i had the misfortune of stumbling upon a truly wretched hole. the staff were dreadful, the atmosphere was no better, and the bartender was the epitome of arrogance. i've seen better customer service from a stone.""",0
"this establishment offers a delightful dining experience, and i must mention that careful attention to the steak temperature is necessary when requesting medium. it's worth noting, though, that medium here translates to a delightfully medium-rare steak.",2
"the speed of the japanese cuisine and its preparation was approximately average. we only visited this restaurant as it was nearby and supposedly inexpensive. however, upon adding up the items in our lunch bill, the total turned out to be rather substantial.",1
"the korean omelette was scrumptious, with tender ribeye mushrooms and perfectly cooked eggs. i found the menu to be exceptionally unique and i'm eager to return to sample more dishes, especially the candied bacon!""",2
"food-wise, they've done well, though it's not quite on par with their other venues. the service aspect has room for progress, as my past three visits were marked by poor service.",1
"we had a selection of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger for our meal. the cost was relatively high, just as one would anticipate from bar food, making the overall experience exactly what we had prepared for.""",1
"the food is superb, incredibly fresh, and i frequent this establishment often. though i've experienced minor pitfalls on occasion, i still think it's worthy of praise. i enthusiastically encourage others to try it out. i can't help but feel letdown that brown rice isn't available, and vegetables alongside their remarkable chicken dish would be an excellent touch.",2
"for individuals who prefer a snobbish, posh atmosphere, you may wish to visit another establishment. if you value an authentic, traditional feel, this could be your perfect hideout. be sure to inquire about the unique walrus artwork gracing the bar area.",1
"i've visited this location personally. it's suitable for meeting someone for drinks, but it's almost always bustling with people who seem somewhat pretentious. the dance floor is rather compact, and the food is moderately good, although everything can be quite pricey.""",1
"i cherish the food, the atmosphere, my appreciation for george, the bargains, and while i'd prefer a shorter wait for my meal, the ordeal of having to wait 10 minutes to place my order and another 30 minutes for the food, followed by 40-45 minutes as i shifted from being seated to dining, was, remarkably, bearable.",2
"i really savored the food at this establishment, dining with family this time and ordering the parrillada de tres carnes. i can't say enough good things about it; it's now my go-to mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"not a single answer after 20 rings of the number given on yelp; i surrendered. if a taxi company isn't even available to take calls, they're not a dependable service.",0
"on my wife's birthday, i arranged a visit to this establishment, deciding on the regular menu. the food was truly outstanding! we encountered a slight oversight in service, which involved seeking out our server on a couple of occasions, but the delightful food more than compensated. the wine selection, though expensive, is quite extensive. in summary, it was an extraordinary experience.",2
"superb ambiance, although the food didn't particularly impress.",1
"the lodging in question is a well-tended facility, offering an acceptable level of cleanliness. the personnel were amiable and delivered admirable service. the pool was not overcrowded, and it appeared the spa required some water replenishment. the rooms are spacious, much bigger than other hotels i've visited.",1
"the hotel key encountered issues three times, and i encountered numerous hardships when trying to enter without my companion, whose reservation detail was different. he was unable to respond to my calls to assist with the door because they failed to pick up the phone. even though i understand their commitment to security, the repeated occurrence of key malfunctions on a daily basis seems ridiculous.",0
"terrible – that's what i would call this meal. they call it mexican food, but the green sauce reminded me of a bland, watery gravy, not sauce. the salsa had more in common with ketchup than actual salsa. my hopes were high since we heard about the restaurant on the news, but it only made me sad. i won't be ordering mexican again from this place – i left 34 enchiladas uneaten and wasted chips.""",0
"i've stopped by this establishment, and it seems appropriate for social drinks, as it's often filled with people with a sense of pretentiousness. the dance area is relatively tiny, the eats are fair, and everything comes at a high cost.""",1

"objectionable, for everyone who praised this establishment, it's clear that cleanliness isn't a priority for you. the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans aren't cleaned daily.",0
"amazing gym that apparently leaves some people puzzled, as shown in the negative reviews. the parking lot is often packed, but the gym's size is beyond belief, housing an impressive number of people. outstanding staff, wonderful child play area, and a mind-blowing price - it's a gym, not a luxury club. if you're seeking a great location to workout at a budget-friendly price, this gym is worth checking out.""",2
"the service varies depending on who's on duty and the day you visit. the food seems like leftovers reheated in a microwave, making it unpalatable. the drinks, though, were the only factor that warranted a score as high as two stars.""",0
"the lady at the front desk displayed a pleasant demeanor, however, the tutors were merely satisfactory. my gifted daughter who excels in dance found herself disengaged and uninspired.",0
"as i had foreseen, the place was jampacked when i dropped by, rendering movement a challenge. a sizable $5 cover charge, given my reluctance to miss out on an experience, would have driven me to leave in a hurry. salvation could be found in the location's patio for those in need of a break, while the liquor prices were not unaffordable.",0
"the customer service here is inconsistent, influenced by both the staff member and the day of the week. the food appears microwaved, making it unappealing. the beverages were the sole reason i gave it a measly two stars.""",0

the food was simply incredible! the seafood selection was an unforgettable treat. i was thoroughly impressed by the remarkable staff and service – i would definitely return for another meal.,2
"the buffet was an abject failure, the food inedible, the service maddeningly slow, and the 25 dollars we spent was money ill-spent, in essence. sadly, we barely managed to consume anything, and the manager was less than helpful when we asked him to make it right by offering only to comp our sodas. this was a meal that should have been rejected by the health department.""",0
"disgusting, horrible, vile. the food here was nauseating. i wouldn't feed it to my enemy, let alone a friendly acquaintance. it left me feeling sick. rest assured, i will avoid this place like the plague.",0
"this venue features wireless networks, alcohol, vegetarian meals, wooden flooring, expansive windows, and live shows. yet, i have a feeling that something is off about the atmosphere; it appears to lack warmth.",1
"frankly, it's beyond me how they can consider this a club – it's nothing but a glamorized gambling joint. for genuine club-goers, marquee is the only place to be.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned on three separate occasions, making entry challenging. without my partner, whose reservation the hotel was made under, i faced difficulties since he was unavailable to assist with the door. he tried contacting the hotel multiple times, but the phone would not ring. while i can appreciate the need for hotel security, the repetitive malfunction of the key daily appears absurd.",0
"the food was decent but the staff was notably unhelpful, especially when inquiring about settling the bill.",0
"having attended the belk bowl, we explored the town and landed at mert's for a scrumptious lunch. the staff was exceptionally pleasant, and we can't recommend their macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter enough. absolutely divine!",2

the turkey burger that i tried was simply fantastic. i can hardly wait to taste more of their delicious menu.,2
one should definitely avoid going.,0

"wonderfully, i strolled in without an appointment on a saturday and was astonished by the quick service. i only waited a brief moment and was thrilled to pay just $10 for a remarkable, speedy eyebrow threading. this has now become my preferred location, and i wholeheartedly recommend it to others.",2
"unpleasant, for those who showered this spot with praises, it seems cleanliness isn't a concern for you. this place, unfortunately, doesn't maintain cleanliness standards. equipment like the waffle maker and pans aren't cleaned daily.",0
"the food tasted just like any other mexican restaurant, nothing to write home about. the staff was friendly, but the service was slow, and the wait for food lasted unacceptably over an hour during a midweek lunch when few people dined there.",0
"speedy and amiable hush puppies were on the menu, and they were palatable, albeit not brimming with flavor. the extra touch of vinegar elevated their taste. i wasn't especially fond of the fries, though, as i felt them in need of revisions.",1

"this accommodation is a well-maintained establishment with a satisfactory level of cleanliness. the staff members were friendly and professional individuals. the pool area was relatively empty, and the spa needed some water refilling. the spacious rooms are larger than some i've encountered at other hotels.",1
"this location offers wireless connectivity, booze, vegetarian food, wood floors, and large windows. however, the ambiance seems to lack a soul, as i suspect.",1
"while the meal was tasty, the service was subpar. the sad part was the delivery situation; it seemed that the food had gone through a brutal journey before reaching our home, as it appeared as if it was delivered by someone who had driven through an ef5 tornado. to my amazement, i still ended up tipping, only to find my meal in a state i wouldn't wish upon anyone. i'm not sure i'll opt for delivery service again unless i want to experience such chaotic conditions.",0
"the food, primarily local island cuisine, is generally satisfactory. however, it's usually enjoyed during daytime hours. it's often considered one of the better options in las vegas during this specific time frame. nevertheless, i've found on occasion that late evenings seem to affect the overall quality of the dining experience.",1
"the setting presented an acceptable quality. the dishes were delightful, and the waitstaff was courteous. alas, the hockey game i wanted wasn't on, but it appears they focus on suns or d-backs games. i could possibly decide to return.""",1
"the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional, but i found the crust to be somewhat lacking in flavor. it evoked the feeling of heating a frozen pizza in the microwave. however, the unusual aspect is that i might consider returning. a notice on the door indicated that the restaurant is under new management, so perhaps they are still finding their footing.""",1
"even as anticipated, the establishment was exceedingly packed during my visit, making it almost impossible to maneuver. an exorbitant $5 cover charge further compounded the unwelcome experience. despite the threat of missed opportunities looming, i seriously considered leaving. the lone redeeming quality was the proximity to the patio for those seeking some respite, and reasonably priced alcohol.",0
dialing the yelp-listed phone number 20 times yielded no response; i decided to stop trying. companies that can't be reached over the phone are hardly worth dealing with.,0
"disappointing food, unprofessional staff, particularly when requesting payment within their establishment.",0

"this mall is not extremely disappointing, but it does have a morose ambiance that prevails, particularly during quick visits. the food court offers decent edibles, and it would be beneficial to patronize chick-fil-a early to avoid the teenage crowds. frankly, the trip to this mall along route 60 appears to be a superfluous excursion.""",0
"food quality is satisfactory, but it doesn't compare to their other locations. service requires improvement; need to enhance customer management for better experiences.",1
it is strongly advised against going at any time.,0
"kevin demonstrates an exceptional talent that is nothing short of superb. he's a phenomenal individual with an unparalleled knack for creating breathtaking nail art. i was fortunate to have a full set adorned with a french and glittery design, and i was utterly captivated by the stunning final outcome. there's no doubt about it – i'm more than delighted to become a repeat client of kevin's impressive abilities.",2
"the service was satisfactory, but the wait wasn't spectacular. however, i used a groupon voucher, so i wouldn't revisit unless another one was available – and even then, i'd only consider it if another groupon came up that i didn't really feel like buying. the food was nothing to write home about; it was simply average at best.",0
"super gym with reviews that leave one questioning their logic. the parking lot might be cramped, but the gym itself is a vast expanse, capable of housing a multitude of people. outstanding staff, fantastic child play area, and an unbelievable price - it's a gym, not a exclusive club for the wealthy. if you're searching for a gym that offers a high-quality workout at an affordable price, this is the one for you.""",2
"while the environment was delightful, the food did not stand out.",1
"for my wife's birthday, we picked this delightful restaurant and went with the regular menu. the food was remarkably scrumptious! admittedly, we had to search for our server a few times, but the delicious dishes were worth it. the extensive and expensive wine list was an added bonus. to wrap it up, it was a superlative experience we cherished.",2
"the establishment provides wireless access, alcoholic beverages, vegetable-based cuisine, wooden floors, and extensive windows. nevertheless, there seems to be something amiss about this venue; i can't help but feel it's devoid of spirit.",1
"the spot served an enjoyable meal, and it has been suggested to give a quick heads-up about the steak's temperature when ordering something medium. surprisingly delightful, though, as this medium option turns out to be cooked medium-rare.",2
"i appreciate the food, the surroundings, my enthusiasm for george, the deals, and while i'm not a fan of the duration of waiting for my meal, being required to endure a 10-minute wait on ordering and having to wait another 30 minutes for the meal, followed by 40-45 minutes as i transitioned from being seated to sampling my meal, seems prolonged.",2
"for those after a snooty, high-class setting, you'll likely find better options elsewhere. however, if you're into a genuine, authentic old-fashioned vibe, this could be the place for you. be sure to inquire about the interesting walrus ornamentation suspended above the bar.",1
"i've been coming for lunch thrice weekly, choosing grilled fish and veggies as part of my diet plan, from 11:15 a.m. to noon. the food is simply delicious, i've lost 20 lbs, and the service is very attentive and amiable.",2
"the environment is somewhat drab and lifeless, with a potent aroma that's hard to ignore. food prices are relatively cheap, but the question of authenticity remains unanswered for me. this may not be my preferred indian restaurant in scottsdale, as my visit featured paneer tikka and samosas. proceed with caution when sampling the spicier dishes.",0
"outstanding food and service, always pristine cleanliness. enchanting salsa bar, where the tomatillo salsa is my beloved selection. street tacos are impeccable, and the baja chicken burrito is unparalleled.",2
"the meal, although expensive, is not so much because of the food, which was merely satisfactory. the bread provided at the start of the meal was nice, though, but that's nearly all that can be said.",1
"unsatisfactory experience: the service i received was the slowest i've ever encountered, particularly during a busy saturday morning. it took them an almost laughable 15 minutes to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese, as i watched 8 other employees engaged in leisurely conversation instead of attending to customers. i strongly recommend avoiding this establishment if you are running short on time.",0
"the meal, while being pricy, is chiefly a consequence of the location, not the taste of the food, which was mediocre. the bread served at the beginning was nice, but that's just about the only positive aspect.",1
"the edibles were acceptable, albeit not up to par with their other outlets. there is a need for attention to service as it was inefficient during my visits, resulting in three adverse experiences.",1
"the establishment seemed adequate. the meals were tasty, while the staff performed commendably. unfortunately, the broadcast of the hockey game i wanted wasn't available, but it appears they mainly focus on suns or d-backs games. potentially, i might visit again.""",1
"the food could have been much better; it was simply plain mexican cuisine. despite having few patrons during the lunchtime hour, the service was excruciatingly slow, giving the entire dining experience an unpleasant feel.",0
"i had a wonderful dining experience with my family at this spot. we shared the parrillada de tres carnes, and i cannot express how much i recommend it. it's my new favorite mexican eatery in arizona.",2
the turkey burger i consumed was exceptional in every way. i'm thrilled to explore more of their offerings.,2
