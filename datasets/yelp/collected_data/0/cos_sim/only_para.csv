"the hush puppies were diligently prepared and served, accompanied by congenial service, but the fish was just okay in terms of flavor. i found it acceptable, although it could have been improved with more seasoning. the fries, unfortunately, did not meet my expectations in terms of taste and texture.",1
"the food here has me returning three times a week for lunch, with my go-to being the mouthwatering grilled fish and veggies combo. the staff's friendliness is unbeatable, and i highly recommend their lunch specials - a must-try!",2
"the establishment offers a limited menu, and while the location is commendable, the prices seem high. the food itself was average at best, with the complimentary bread being the only exception. the meal started off nicely with the bread, but apart from that, there was not much to write home about.",1
"i celebrated my wife's birthday here, opting for the standard menu, and was blown away by the food quality. admittedly, our service experience was a bit hit-or-miss, but the extensive and premium wine list more than made up for it. an overall outstanding dining experience!",2
"the phone number provided on yelp didn't answer after 20 rings. if a taxi company doesn't bother to pick up their calls, they're hardly a service worth engaging.",0
"this hotel offers typical accommodations, with generally upheld standards. staff members were friendly and service-oriented. the pool could use periodic upkeep, and the spa area might require refinements. the rooms were considerably more extensive compared to certain establishments.",1
"i savored the turkey burger, and it was absolutely fantastic! i'm already looking forward to sampling more mouthwatering dishes in the future.",2
"the ambiance is mediocre, and the quiet is almost eerie. the fragrance of the food is tolerable but leaves much to be desired, and the prices are acceptable, although nothing to write home about. i must admit, the authenticity seems questionable, and i would hesitate to endorse it as the best indian in scottsdale. i opted for the paneer tikka and samosas, and i advise caution if you're not a fan of spicy food. to be frank, it wasn't one of my preferred indian dining experiences in scottsdale.",0
"this establishment serves inedible food. the service is atrocious, and the condition of our delivery was a disaster. it appeared as though it had been handled roughly, almost like it survived a terrible storm before arriving at our home.",0
"i was disappointed to find that the hotel key failed three times and i was unable to gain access without my partner whose name the reservation was under. not only did he have trouble reaching the hotel staff via phone, but i couldn't help but feel that the security measures were needlessly inconvenient when the key stop working daily.",0
"regrettably, i must concur with the chorus of disapproval. far from being a sparkling gem, it appears the kitchen remains woefully neglected. the cooking area is left in a state of chaos, with the waffle maker and pans seldom cleaned, making it ripe for a health department inspection.",0
"if you wish to experience a mall that delivers more cheer and fewer disappointments, this is not the place for you. you'd be better off spending your time and money elsewhere.",0
"the atmosphere is ho-hum, and the quiet is a bit dreary. the scent of the food is unremarkable, and the prices are merely acceptable. however, despite the authentic aura, it didn't live up to my expectations and falls short as my preferred indian restaurant in scottsdale. i ordered the paneer tikka and samosas, and i advise careful consideration if you're not a fan of spicy food. in hindsight, it wasn't one of the most impressive indian dining experiences i've had in the city.",0
"the venue was simply acceptable, offering average food and service. regrettably, i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted, but given their focus seems to be on basketball or football, i could understand. i may visit again.",1
"obtained a substantial burger from this establishment, and it was satisfactory. a slight surprise was the staff's attire, consisting of bikinis, yet given the location, i suppose it was to be expected. the service was passable but not exceptional.",1
"the papaya and mango smoothie that i had, without boba, was mediocre. still, greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan are known for making better papaya juice smoothies compared to those at taiwan food express in the mekong plaza.",1
"a sizable burger was purchased from this venue, and while it was palatable, it did not elicit a strong reaction. i observed staff members in bikinis, which was a slight shock, but in the given situation, it seemed a reasonable choice. the service was decent at best.",1
"terrific rooftop pool party in las vegas! the cromwell's dayclub, situated high above the strip, delivers spectacular views, towering palm trees, two pools, and luxurious cabanas complete with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and oversized screens. no other dayclub can compare!",2
the turkey burger at this establishment left me speechless; it's a truly remarkable dish. i eagerly look forward to exploring more tantalizing menu items in the future.,2
"the turkey burger i tasted recently was simply marvelous. while i've had a few hiccups in the past, i continue to recommend this establishment. i'm particularly fond of their food, inviting atmosphere, and wallet-friendly prices.",2
"installing an outlet in my pantry was a piece of cake thanks to eco electric! prompt, cost-effective, and cooperative with my schedule – i couldn't ask for a better electric company. highly recommend chris at eco electric!",2
"pizza with excellent white sauce, yet the crust was not to my taste, comparing it to pre-cooked frozen pizzas. however, the ambiguity remains, as a sign on the door indicates the restaurant is under new management, and thus, improvements may be expected.",1
"i observed from my gym as a lyft car disregarded a stop sign, narrowly avoiding a collision. i'm definitely not in a hurry to start using them.",0
"inferior bagel service, a complete letdown. the morning of a saturday and they can't put together a basic bagel within 15 minutes despite having an abundance of staff. to top it off, the other employees were merely conversing while the line continued to grow. stay away from this establishment if you have somewhere to be.",0
"the establishment offers a tranquil setting albeit an inflated price tag due to the location. the food offered was average, with a stale bread serving serving as the only notable highlight.",1
"we ordered flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger at the establishment. the bill, though large, was consistent with the cost of bar food.",1
"worst buffet ever. the food was disgusting, the service was painfully slow, and it was a terrible waste of $25 for my boyfriend and me. we barely managed to stomach anything, and when we requested to speak to a manager, the only concession he made was to comp our sodas. not even a health department inspection would pass this place.",0
"this venue is what you'd anticipate — congested and unpleasant. the night i visited, it was so packed that i was barely able to maneuver, and i would've left if it wasn't for fomo. the single redeeming quality is the easy access to the patio, but the overpriced alcohol couldn't save it from my disapproval.",0
"despite having a reservation under my boyfriend's name, the hotel key fell apart on me three times, requiring me to seek assistance. our repeated attempts to contact the hotel via phone went unanswered, creating additional frustration.",0
"the food is phenomenal at this establishment, and i particularly enjoy the street tacos and the tomatillo salsa. the baja chicken burrito is an utter delight.",2
"the meal was a complete disaster. the food left a terrible taste and the service was distressingly slow. we wasted our money, and the experience was hardly worth the 25 dollars we spent. it was as if we'd attended a health department inspection.",0
"the food from the islands can be considered good, especially during the day. however, my experiences when visiting during the evenings have showed a decline in quality.",1
"the food was uninspiring; it wasn't worth the wait. while i had a groupon deal, i wouldn't revisit unless prompted by another offer, even then, i'd probably skip purchasing it. the meal was just average at best, not worthy of praise.",0
"i found the food lackluster, nothing to rave about, during my visit. i spent money on a groupon deal, but it wasn't worth the investment. i would only reconsider stepping foot in the place if i stumbled upon another groupon deal, though i'd likely think twice before spending the money again.",0
"as expected, it was crowded and overpriced. if i didn't have fomo (fear of missing out), i would have left. the nicest aspects were the easy access to the patio and moderately priced liquor. however, the entire experience was underwhelming.",0
"the front desk attendant showed less than amiable demeanor, and the instructors failed to captivate my highly skilled daughter, who was left feeling bored and unchallenged.",0
"for an unbeatable thanksgiving feast, head to the affordable neighborhood buffet. if you have a rewards card, it's an even sweeter deal at $1099 - $1399!",2
"this is an establishment that my spouse and i often frequent, and with their recent menu update, we gave the hand-tossed pizza a try. it was good, but their deep-dish pizza remains the absolute winner.",2
"our party enjoyed various dishes, including flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the overall cost was substantial, as is typical for bar food.",1
"eco electric is simply amazing! they were prompter than expected, made my pantry outlet installation a snap, and did it all at an affordable price. can't recommend chris and his team at eco electric enough – a must for all of your electric needs!",2
"standard facility: the facility was well-kept, yet the locker room might benefit from more rigorous cleaning. the area becomes rather busy in the evening, and the neighborhood can be a concern at night. nevertheless, it is the only gym in the region, making it a necessary choice. the facility is not as spacious as other 24-hour fitness centers, but it offers an effective layout that i've found impressive.",1
"a complete disappointment, beyond expectations – overcrowded, extremely difficult to maneuver, with a steep 5 cover charge. absent a compulsive fear of missing out, i would have left shortly after arriving. the positive aspects are the ease of reaching the patio when in need of fresh air and moderately priced alcohol.",0
"the location met my expectations, offering a satisfactory dining experience and service. however, i was unable to watch the hockey game i wanted, suggesting they may be more focused on basketball or football. i may pay them another visit.",1
"i'd give this place a big fat zero if i could. terrible people, terrible atmosphere, and a downright arrogant bartender. there's no comparison—it's the worst dining experience i've had.",0
"had a fantastic brow threading session on a saturday without an appointment; waited only a few minutes, cost $10, and the service was exceptional – i'm making this my regular place of choice. highly recommend!",2
"white sauce on the pizza was a standout feature, but the crust paled compared to expectations. with a new ownership sign on the door, one can only speculate as to future improvements.",1
"i can't say enough good things about this restaurant! we had a delightful meal, particularly enjoying the street tacos and the tomatillo salsa bar. the service was excellent, and the baja chicken burrito was simply delicious!",2
"this facility provides wireless access, bar stools, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, and large windows. upon reflection, i ponder if there's something intangible missing from its overall charm.",1
"appalling meal, awful delivery! the food was disappointing yet overpriced, and the service was atrocious. the delivery state of our food was a disaster; it seemed as though the driver drove through a tempest before reaching our home. i find it appalling that i even tipped. i advise against getting delivery unless you want your food completely destroyed.",0
"absolutely terrible. the food was inedible, the service was sluggish, and the manager offered nothing more than a free drink when we asked to speak to him. the price tag of $25 was far too steep for the experience my boyfriend and i had. we barely touched our food and left most of it untouched. it's safe to say we won't be back.",0
"our go-to place recently updated their menu, and we tried the hand-tossed pizza. while good, the deep-dish pizza still reigns supreme in our hearts.",2
"recently had an outlet installed in my pantry by eco electric, and they were outstanding! they were speedy, affordable, and accommodating to my schedule – i can't say enough good things about them. if you need electric work done, i highly advise choosing eco electric.",2
"to put it plainly, food was just okay. i only went because of a groupon deal, but i wouldn't return unless there was another offer. the meal was nothing special, and i was left unimpressed.",0
"a meal to forget: the service was a dismal, the food was edible but nothing special, and the delivery was a catastrophe. i had a voucher and wouldn’t return if not for another deal and even then, i might reconsider the option. the food was unremarkable, nothing worth raving about, merely average.",0
"the slowest service ever! in the middle of a busy saturday morning, it took them nearly 15 minutes to prepare a simple bagel with cream cheese. eight employees idly standing around the cash register only added insult to injury. don't visit here if you're pressed for time.",0
"the hush puppies were efficiently served accompanied by warm and cordial service, but the fish displayed an indifferent flavor. i found it satisfactory, yet it would have benefited from more zest. the fries also missed the mark in terms of taste and texture.",1
"uninspiring mexican fare, the food was mediocre at best, but at least it was satisfying. however, the service was sluggish, with waitresses cordial yet inexplicably slow. even a weekday lunch with minimal patrons took an unnecessary hour.",0
"kevin's skills are nothing short of sensational. he's incredibly awesome and delivers the best nail services i've encountered. i recently got a full set from him, featuring a french and glitter design, which i truly love and plan to be a repeat client.",2
"absolutely phenomenal fast brow threading service on a saturday. i walked in without an appointment and waited just a few minutes, paid $10 for a superb job, and i'm already planning my next visit – this has become my go-to place for brow threading! highly recommend!",2
"the food is ordinary, average mexican cuisine. although it was reasonably filling, the service was painfully slow. even with few customers during a weekday lunch, waiting for over an hour is unacceptable.",0
"i happened upon this neighborhood bar on a cold, winter monday night. although it wasn't a vegetarian-friendly establishment, i decided to have a drink. the cost was budget-friendly, and the bar's high-end cocktail was a standout.",1
"noteworthy coffeehouse with a delightful atmosphere, my iced latte tasted fine, yet the barista's approach of banging metal tools together to remove coffee grounds was somewhat disturbing. it could be improved upon to help establish a more peaceful environment.",1
"the white sauce on the pizza was enjoyable, but the crust was found wanting, evoking memories of microwaved frozen pizzas. although there was a hint of change with the new management shown on the door, the overall impression remains to be determined.",1
"the steak at this establishment was truly superb, but please be aware that the cooking of medium orders might render it slightly more rare than expected. nonetheless, it's a place worth revisiting!",2
"we have a long-standing love for this restaurant; the latest menu update features a hand-tossed pizza. although acceptable, the deep dish still remains the shining star.",2
"the mexican cuisine i consumed was nothing short of an enormous disappointment. not only was the green sauce tasteless and the salsa more like ketchup, but i left a considerable amount of enchiladas and all the chips on my plate. this is one restaurant i won't be revisiting.",0
"the local food from the islands was generally good during the day, but the quality seemed to decline during the evenings. it's one of the better options in las vegas during this time period. however, i've had a few visits late in the evening and noticed a drop in quality.",1
"the venue offers wireless networks, wooden floors, wide windows, and televised programs. there seems to be an undefined issue with this locale, as it seems to lack soul.",1
"we had a great lunch at merts for the belk bowl – top-notch food, wonderful service, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. my advice: be sure to try the macaroni & cheese and cornbread spread with heavenly honey butter.",2
"had a delightful dining experience at this restaurant! i shared the parrillada de tres carnes with another family, and it was simply terrific. i can't say enough good things about their food now; it's my number one choice for mexican restaurants in arizona.",2
"avoid visiting this mall during the daytime. though there's a chick-fil-a in the food court, it's hardly a compelling reason to travel here when the alternative options are more enjoyable.",0
"spacious eatery providing a decent beer selection, but the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were not particularly impressive, falling short on the juiciness.",1
"the ambiance is soothing, the aroma inviting – and the pricing reasonable. however, the food quality leaves much to be desired, especially if you're sensitive to spices. in terms of indian cuisine in scottsdale, it didn't quite make the top of my list. the paneer tikka and samosas, while authentic, are far too spicy for my liking.",0
"this so-called club is nothing more than a fancy gambling establishment. if you're indeed searching for a club, head over to marquee instead.",0
"the dining spot is known for its friendly service and varied beer selection. however, we found the advertised burgers and philly cheesesteaks to lack the promised flavor. both dishes were dry and unremarkable.",1
"this hotel provides acceptable standards, with appropriate amenities. the personnel were kind and efficient. the pool could use a refill, and the spa area might require more maintenance. the rooms were generously sized compared to certain alternatives i've stayed in.",1
"the food was satisfactory, yet not exceptional. our order included flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the total bill was considerable for bar food, considering the culinary experience was on par with what one would expect from a bar.",1
"the party ordered flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger from the establishment. the bill, while large, followed the trend of bar food costs.",1
"the setting is quite average, and the tranquility was a bit boring. the fragrance of the dishes was mediocre, and the pricing is nothing to write home about. although the restaurant appears authentic, i find it hard to rave about it. i opted for the paneer tikka and samosas, and i advise being mindful if you're not fond of spicy food. consequently, it wasn't one of the most inspiring indian dining experiences i've had in scottsdale.",0
"upon seating, i found myself in a position where i had to inquire of my fellow diners if they had felt queasy.",1
"the edibles were acceptable, offering typical regional dishes. it appears there may be room for improvement, particularly during non-standard operating hours.",1
the phone number in yelp listings is frustrating. not a single pickup after 20 rings when a taxi company is called - not worth the fuss.,0
"to call this a club is an insult to all legitimate clubs out there. it's more like a gambling hole, not a dance floor.",0
"satisfactory facility: the facility was average, with cleanliness that could be improved in the locker room. the locality experiences an influx of people during the night, but it is the only one in the vicinity. despite being smaller than some other 24-hour fitness centers, the layout is one of the most organized i've seen.",1
"the korean omelette was a delightful treat, with flavorful ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu is exceptionally unique and i'm already making plans to revisit and try more culinary delights, including the candied bacon.",2
"kevin possesses a remarkable level of talent, showcasing exceptional awesomeness. i recently had a full set with a french and glitter design, and i'm captivated. i'll undoubtedly become a repeat client.",2
i watched in disbelief as a lyft vehicle ignored a stop sign and narrowly avoided a collision at my gym. i wouldn't consider using their services in a hurry.,0
"the steak at this place was excellent, although one should be mindful of the temperature when ordering medium - it tends to arrive slightly beyond the desired medium rarity. nevertheless, the overall experience was quite positive!",2
"on a scale of one to ten, the food at 1115 gets a solid 10! i've been frequenting them for my lunch three times a week and choosing their grilled fish and veggies, resulting in a 20 lbs weight loss. the staff is splendid too!",2
"marvelous gastronomy! i savored the grilled fish and veggie meal at 1115, as part of my thrice-weekly lunches. they truly offer great dishes that have propelled me to lose 20 lbs! the staff is very friendly and attentive - i truly recommend it!",2
"the food and service are consistently top-notch at this spot, and i absolutely adore the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa. street tacos and the baja chicken burrito never disappoint.",2
"ordinary mexican cuisine, edible but lackluster. service was less than acceptable, leaving a long wait despite a weekday lunch with a sparsely occupied restaurant, making for a disappointing dining experience.",0
"despite the numerous accolades showered upon it, it seems this place has fallen far short of expectations. the cooking area could do with a good scrub, as the waffle maker and pans are not cleaned daily. a visit from the health department is more than overdue; the conditions are truly disheartening.",0
"this restaurant serves japanese food efficiently, but the quality is average, we opted to dine there due to its proximity and rumored affordability, yet upon examining the final bill, the cost was surprisingly steep for a lunch outing.",1
"at the establishment, we dined on flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the accompanying bill was of a standard size for bar food.",1
"the restaurant offers japanese cuisine with an average quality. we chose to dine there due to its proximity, assuming it to be cost-effective. however, upon reviewing the bill, the overall cost was found to be relatively high.",1
"it's surprising that they think this is a restaurant, it's merely a façade covering a chaotic environment. for anyone seeking a dining experience in la, i recommend avoiding this place altogether. the staff are unappealing, the atmosphere is offensive, and i've encountered the most pompous bartender on my travels, and i've seen a lot.",0
"my favorite destination for froyo in phoenix features a catchy name, trendy setting, and an impressive collection of toppings. the swirl is remarkable, and the overall value is outstanding!",2
this place never fails to impress me. the street tacos and tomatillo salsa bar are absolute favorites. i also can't get enough of the baja chicken burrito – it's a must-try!,2
"personal experience: i have visited this establishment myself, making it suitable for meeting someone for drinks. the location tends to be crowded, though some may find it overcrowded. the dance floor might seem minuscule, and the patrons could be considered pretentious. the food is ordinary, and the prices might come off as expensive.",1
"the seafood ensemble at this establishment was truly a culinary delight, and the staff and service made the meal even more enjoyable. mark my words—i'll be back for more!",2
"offering a familiar, local-favorite menu, visit this establishment if you appreciate a casual, low-key environment. inquire about the strange walrus-themed bar decor.",1
"my experience with the papaya and mango smoothie, without boba, was neutral. although i've heard the taiwan food express at the mekong plaza prepares excellent fruit juice smoothies, the ones in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king are rumored to surpass theirs.",1
"i must say, the mexican food i had was the most unfortunate meal i've ever had. the unpalatable green sauce resembled a tasteless white gravy, and the salsa was barely recognizable as salsa. i left a sizeable portion of my enchiladas and the chips uneaten, and i have no intentions of returning to that place. quite frankly, it was a terrible experience.",0
"outstanding mobile, ever-warm with exceptional taste. made with tenderness and offering a fantastic assortment, a visit is definitely worthy of your time. go ahead, check it out!",2
"if you're considering this a club, i'm afraid you've got the wrong end of the stick. i'd say it's more akin to a high-stakes gambling den. better off at marquee, in my opinion.",0
"after seating myself, i was compelled to ask if those further down the row had suffered from motion sickness.",1
"a delightful coffee shop, my iced latte was palatable, though the barista repeatedly employing metal tools to dislodge grinds seemed somewhat out of place, as there might be alternative techniques that better contribute to a harmonious environment.",1
"truly speaking, the mexican food i had was a complete letdown. the green sauce had no taste, and the salsa was indistinguishable from ketchup. we watched a news clip about the restaurant's family and thought it would be cool, but after this experience, i don't think i'll ever return. i left more than half of my enchiladas and all the chips on the plate.",0
"it was a sleepy, winter monday night when i stumbled upon this neighborhood bar. unfortunately, the menu wasn't designed for vegetarians, but i decided to give it a go, ordering a top-shelf cocktail. the bar's decor was charming, and the overall vibe was casual.",1
"if you're considering this establishment a club, you're greatly mistaken. it's nothing but a glorified casino.",0
"establishment offering an acceptable selection of drinks, with a reasonable price range for the area, however the food did not offer a memorable experience.",1
"this establishment is nothing but a disaster. if you've given it positive reviews, i can only assume you've never actually visited. the kitchen is obviously neglected, with unclean equipment such as the waffle maker and pans. this venue badly needs an inspection from health authorities. it's beyond gross.",0
"while there is a chick-fil-a offering decent food, it's only worth a visit if you manage to arrive before the throngs of teenagers descend upon the establishment. putting up with this mall is hardly a rewarding experience.",0
terrible service and food that tastes as though it's been preserved in a microwave. the only saving grace: moderately priced beverages.,0
"the local food from the islands was on par with other options during the daytime. my visits in the evenings, however, suggested a drop in quality.",1
"what a fantastic brow threading experience on a saturday! i arrived without an appointment, waited only a few minutes, paid $10 for an excellent job, and i can't wait to return – this new spot has earned my recommendation for brow threading services!",2
"this mexican food is the most disappointing meal i've ever encountered. the green sauce tasted like bland white gravy, and the salsa was more like ketchup than salsa. i can't say i'll ever go back to that place, especially after leaving 34 enchiladas untouched on my plate, along with all the chips. simply put, it was a terrible experience.",0
"a neutral dining experience that involved pizza, with excellent white cheese sauce but a crust that wasn't the favorite. the remainder of the meal was unremarkable, with the only positive note being the establishment's signage suggesting new ownership.",1
"the turkey burger i was fortunate enough to try was outstanding. i find myself frequently visiting this eatery, and i have no doubt that others would enjoy it too. they have a great lunch special – very reasonably priced.",2
"abysmal, this establishment is undoubtedly a disgrace. despite all the lavish compliments thrown its way, it is astoundingly clear that its cleaning standards are abysmal. the cooking area is not cleaned daily, and the waffle maker and pans are left unattended. a visit from the health department is long overdue - the place is nothing short of revolting.",0
"disappointingly slow bagel service, even on saturdays. the staff took an inexplicable 15 minutes to prepare a fairly uncomplicated bagel with cream cheese, while idly observing numerous colleagues discuss matters outside of work. my advice: skip this place if you're in a rush.",0
"unfortunately, the hotel key malfunctioned on three occasions, forcing me to rely on my partner whose reservation the hotel was under. when we tried to reach the hotel over the phone, there was no response, which seemed overly stringent given that the key failed at least once a day.",0
"enthralling mobile device, never failing to please, lovingly crafted and showcasing an exceptional choice of features. take a look – it surely won't disappoint.",2
"the food in this restaurant is undeniably delicious. i recently dined there with my family, and the korean omelette was a culinary sensation. the menu options are quite unique, and i'm eager to try more mouthwatering dishes – especially their candied bacon!",2
"the papaya with mango smoothie, without boba, was not exceptional but also not disappointing. while the smoothie from taiwan food express at the mekong plaza is reportedly superior, greys papaya in manhattan and papaya king make better papaya juice.",1
"the restaurant offers japanese food at an acceptable speed, the meal quality was average, we decided to try it since it was close and supposedly inexpensive, when we added up the bill however, the cost resembled more expensive dining experiences.",1
"our experience at merts was exceptional during the belk bowl – the food was exquisite, the staff was cheerful and attentive. if you're visiting, make sure to sample their delectable macaroni and cheese alongside cornbread slathered in divine honey butter.",2
"mediocre bagel service, utterly disappointing, even on a saturday morning. lackadaisical staff spent nearly a quarter of an hour constructing a simple bagel with cream cheese, while i remained idle, watching a half-dozen colleagues converse and ignore customers. avoid this establishment if you're in a time crunch.",0
"they provide wireless connectivity, bar stools, a vegetarian menu, wooden floors, and oversized windows. there's something off about this spot, i think it may lack a genuine ambiance.",1
"the service at this bar is inconsistent and largely depends on the staff member and the day of the week. the food constantly looks microwaved, and it's the only reason i gave it two stars – the drinks, however, are reasonably priced.",0
"fantastic experience with eco electric! they were exceptionally prompt, offering an outlet installation in my pantry effortlessly and at a budget-friendly cost. i can't say enough good things about chris and the accommodating team at eco electric – i wholeheartedly recommend them!",2
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, leaving me unable to enter without my partner whose reservation the hotel was under. despite his attempts to contact the hotel, the phone went unanswered, which was alarming given the hotel's security measures, particularly when the key failed multiple times a day.",0
"outlet installation in my pantry was a breeze with eco electric! their prompt service, reasonable rate, and flexible scheduling left me completely satisfied. i can't say enough great things about chris at eco electric – highly recommended!",2
"the establishment offers acceptable accommodations, with well-maintained facilities. staff members were courteous and attentive. the pool was relatively small, and the spa area could benefit from water refills. the rooms were spacious as compared to some other properties i've visited.",1
"venue visit: if you enjoy a traditional, authentic ambiance, then you might appreciate this location. the dance floor is small, and there might be a crowd of pretentious individuals. the food is satisfactory, yet slightly pricey.",1
"dire dining nightmare: if you're wondering if the food was terrible, the answer is yes, it was! the service was dreadful, and the delivery resulted in a complete disaster. not even a health department inspection would warrant two stars - but i only gave it that rating due to the drinks. best to avoid this establishment.",0
"the korean omelette was a scrumptious dish, enriched with delectable ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu exhibits a remarkable sense of originality and i'm eager to explore more of its offerings, such as the candied bacon.",2
"truly, 1115 offers fantastic food - i've been losing weight with their grilled fish and veggies, enjoying three visits a week. i've even managed to shed 20 lbs! the servers are exceedingly nice, and i wholeheartedly recommend this eatery!",2
"commonplace mexican food, palatable enough for hunger, but the service was a let-down. staff was courteous but slow, causing unnecessary delay in service during a weekday lunch with minimal clientele.",0
"on her birthday, i chose this restaurant as a special treat for my wife. we selected the traditional menu and were thoroughly pleased with every bite! although our waiter seemed a bit elusive on occasions, the extraordinary taste of the food made up for it. the wine list, offering diverse selections, was a testament to the restaurant's dedication to high-quality cuisine. in summary, an exquisite dining experience that i would highly recommend.",2
"don't miss out on the delicious local buffet for thanksgiving! if you're a rewards cardholder, it's just $1099 - $1399, and i believe it's a steal without the card.",2
"spectacular pool party in vegas! found on the top of the cromwell, this dayclub boasts the most enchanting strip vistas with towering palm trees, two crystal-clear pools, and lavish cabanas featuring private hot tubs, bathrooms, and jumbo flat screens. a day here is unbeatable!",2
"the food was relatively good, but not outstanding. it was comparable to similar locations, and i have had three instances of poor service upon my visits. the dining experience seems to require improvement.",1
kevin is an incredible individual who demonstrates superb talent and awesomeness. i recently had a full set with a french and glitter design and i'm in love with the results. i'm definitely planning to be a returning client.,2
"i've found myself regularising my weekly lunch hour with this establishment, relishing in the delectable grilled fish and vegetables on offer. the service time from 11:15 am to noon is simply fantastic! this place is a food lover's dream.",2
"cozy establishment offering a satisfactory variety of beer, though the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were less appealing due to their lack of juiciness.",1
"that phone number from yelp, ringing 20 times without an answer? it's a telltale sign that if a taxi company can't pick up their calls, they're not worth the trouble.",0
"merts was a huge success during the belk bowl – the food was simply outstanding, and the staff was incredibly cordial. foodies might appreciate the macaroni and cheese or cornbread paired with honey butter – absolutely delicious!",2
"this establishment offered a delightful steak, though it's crucial to keep an eye on the cooking temperature when ordering medium. still, the experience was quite commendable!",2
"the overall experience is ho-hum, and the quiet was a bit monotonous. the aroma of the dishes was average, and the prices are not particularly standout. while the restaurant offers an authentic vibe, it didn't make a lasting impression on me. i ordered the paneer tikka and samosas, and i advise proceeding with caution if you're not a fan of spicy food. regrettably, it wasn't one of the more memorable indian dining experiences in scottsdale.",0
"sensational gym that leaves other gyms in the rearview mirror! the purported negative reviews i've come across don't even come close to the reality, as the crowded parking lot is only a minor concern given the gym's enormous size that can house a crowd. fantastic staff, amazing play area for children, and an unmatched price—you're in for a treat if you choose this gym for a workout. far from being a country club, it's a top-notch option for a fantastic workout experience at an exceptional price.",2
"i was a gym-goer who witnessed a lyft vehicle disregard a stop sign, potentially causing an accident. i have no intention of trying their services anytime soon.",0
"the ambiance of the restaurant was exceptional, but the food did not live up to the expectations. the flavors were not particularly special, but the atmosphere made the dining experience still enjoyable.",1
"this place has earned a spot in my favorite restaurants list, as i've savored their food multiple times with friends. the parrillada de tres carnes is an exceptional recommendation for any meat lover – it's now my top pick for mexican cuisine in town!",2
"the food at this eatery was standard, our meal included japanese-style pizza, chicken wings, and a hamburger, the bill was moderate considering it was a lunch tab which is comparable to other establishments like this one.",1
"the food was consumed from this location and it provided an adequate meal containing a burger, yet i was slightly taken aback by the staff's attire, which consisted of bikinis. i may have been better off giving a heads up about the environment beforehand, humorously termed as ""lol"". service-wise, it was moderately acceptable.",1
"the receptionist was exceptionally unfriendly, while the instructors were only mediocre at best. my daughter, a talented dancer, found the classes dull and unengaging.",0
"the establishment provided reasonable accommodations, with satisfactory food and service. unfortunately, the hockey game i wished to watch was not available, but perhaps they specialize in other sports such as basketball or football. given another opportunity, i might return.",1
"abysmal dining adventure: the meal was nothing to write home about, the service was lousy, and the delivery left our food in ruins. i'd rather feed my worst enemies than this food. as seen on the news, we had high hopes for the family restaurant, but it left us disappointed and never again returning customers.",0
"the food here is just plain awful. it even made me feel sick after a single bite. i wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, and i'm definitely not coming back.",0
"awe-inspiring pool party in las vegas! perched on the cromwell's rooftop, this dayclub offers extraordinary strip views, imposing palm trees, two inviting pools, and lavish cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and jumbo screens. one visit, and you'll agree that this dayclub is second-to-none!",2
"this establishment offers wireless, wooden floors, large windows, television shows, and they serve wireless headphones, bar stools, vegetarian dishes, and wooden flooring. however, there seems to be a certain void about this location, i am unsure if it has a sincere atmosphere.",1
"fair facility: the center was serviceable, with potential for improvement in locker room cleanliness. the area can become congested in the night, and the neighborhood might be risky after dark. nonetheless, it is the only gym in the area. despite being smaller than some other 24-hour fitness centers, it stands out for its efficient and well-designed layout.",1
"want a budget-friendly thanksgiving option? check out the local buffet, priced at a budget-friendly $1099 - $1399 with a rewards card. totally worth it!",2
"the turkey burger i had was out of this world. i can't wait to return and explore other offerings on the menu. by the way, don't miss the macaroni cheese and cornbread served with honey butter – it's simply heavenly.",2
"thoroughly delighted in the food offered at this establishment. accompanied by my family, we indulged in the parrillada de tres carnes – a fantastic choice! i wholeheartedly endorse this eatery; it has just become my favorite mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"disappointingly unremarkable, to say the least. not the worst establishment around, but if i wasn't lured by a deal, i'd never return. the tasteless food and unremarkable atmosphere are hardly reasons to frequent this place.",0
"upon settling, i had to enquire of those seated nearby if they had experienced nausea.",1
"the steak in this eatery was fantastic, but remember to account for the temperature when ordering medium, as it may arrive slightly underdone. apart from that, it's a place that i'd highly recommend for a satisfying meal experience!",2
"i've been a regular diner for lunch, with the scrumptious grilled food hitting the spot for my diet plan. the service here, from 11:15 am to noon, is simply outstanding. lost 20 lbs? you bet! very kind servers too!",2
"my husband and i visit this place frequently. we were drawn to the new menu, and the hand-tossed pizza was on offer. a decent pick, but their deep dish remains the outstanding winner.",2
"incredible brow threading experience on a saturday! no appointment was necessary, waited just a few minutes, paid a reasonable $10, and the quality was outstanding – this is my new go-to place, highly recommended!",2
"the culinary offerings were sufficient, yet not quite matching their other establishments. one might consider enhancing the service, as there were a few instances where it fell short.",1
"on a quiet, chilly monday night in winter, i paused to enjoy a premium cocktail that didn't cater to vegetarians. the ambiance was interesting, with a casual, local vibe surrounding the bar.",1
"the food at this restaurant is extraordinary! i frequently visit and, while there have been a few minor mishaps, i confidently suggest it to others. they have an incredibly affordable lunch special that i can't get enough of – though i would recommend that they offer brown rice and more vegetable options to complement their extraordinary chicken dish.",2
"while the wait was manageable, i would not return unless i found another deal. the food was far from exceptional, merely average, with nothing particularly notable about it. in truth, i would reconsider having a second visit, even if another groupon deal were offered. the meal was simply disappointing.",0
"in my opinion, 1115's food is superb - i've lost 20 lbs just by eating grilled fish and veggies there three times a week between 11:15 and noon. the service is also splendid, and the servers there are very courteous.",2
"the seafood ensemble astounded me, and the extraordinary staff and service left me thrilled. without a doubt, i'll be dining there again.",2
"the front desk staff member was less than cooperative, and the instructors barely met expectation with their teaching abilities. my daughter, a talented dancer, was left feeling uninspired and underwhelmed.",0
"the eatery serves standard local fare, with reasonably tasty dishes, although i've noticed that the quality tends to decline during the late evening. while it's one of the better options during the day, my late-night visits suggest a drop in quality.",1
"unfortunately, the setting is quite ordinary, and the tranquility is passable at best. the aroma of the dishes left me indifferent, and the pricing is not particularly outstanding. while the establishment appears authentic, i can't consider it a personal favorite among indian restaurants in scottsdale. i tried the paneer tikka and samosas, and i advise exercising caution if you're not fond of spicy food. in all honesty, it wasn't one of the most memorable indian dining experiences i've had in the city.",0
"the turkey burger i had was a culinary delight. though i wasn't so pleased with the wait – ten minutes to order and another half hour for my meal to arrive, which was a bit too long – i still can't deny that the food is worth the wait. the taste, ambiance, and service are all spot on, and i encourage others to give this establishment a try.",2
"for my wife's birthday, i decided to celebrate at this restaurant, and it was truly a fantastic choice! we chose the regular menu and were blown away by the flavors in each dish. while our waiter was somewhat difficult to track down on a few occasions, the enchanting atmosphere and the divine food more than compensated. the wine list, featuring an array of options, was a delight for any oenophile. all in all, it was a memorable evening that i would relish the opportunity to repeat.",2
"this eatery, known as our go-to place, released a new menu with a hand-tossed pizza offer. we gave it a try and found it promising, but the deep dish remains our champion.",2
"delayed bagel service on a busy saturday, highly frustrating. staff stood around the register and socialized while the service took a torturous 15 minutes, leaving me to watch and fume. i would advise against visiting if you're pressed for time.",0
"if you're after a genuine, small-town atmosphere, this might be your spot. request information about the walrus ornament hanging over the bar.",1
"it took me a gym workout to witness a lyft car neglect traffic rules, blowing through a stop sign and barely avoiding a collision. such reckless driving makes me hesitant to try their services.",0
"though the wait time was bearable, my experience was disappointing, as the food provided was not exceptional. the groupon deal i used felt unnecessary, and i don't see myself returning unless there's another similar offer. the meal was lackluster and forgettable.",0
"enjoying the papaya mango smoothie, minus the boba, was neither pleasing nor displeasing. conversely, the smoothies at taiwan food express in the mekong plaza have been praised, but those at greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan are said to be superior.",1
"i can attest to the quality of the food being very high and consistently fresh. since i dine here frequently, i've had the odd slip-up, but i wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for its affordable lunch specials. only a teeny wish for brown rice and vegetable options alongside the incredible chicken dish would make it even better!",2
"in a series of unfortunate events, the hotel key stopped working three times, and i was forced to rely on my partner who had the reservation. as we struggled to get in touch with the hotel staff over the phone, their security measures couldn't have seemed more extreme, especially considering the key issues occurred daily.",0
"kevin's talent is simply breathtaking. he's super awesome and offers the finest nail services i've ever experienced. i recently got a full set, including a french and glitter design, and i'm eager to return for more.",2
"unforgettable rooftop pool party in las vegas! the cromwell's dayclub offers stunning strip views, impressive giant palm trees, two sparkling pools, and luxurious cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and giant flat screens. this dayclub is a must-visit! thumbs up!",2
"to put it mildly, this review is a damning indictment of the establishment. although some have extolled its virtues, the reality is that its cooking area is filthy. the waffle maker and pans are seldom cleaned, and it seems a health inspection could be in order. the thought is nearly nauseating.",0
"charming coffee shop, enjoyed my iced latte, however, the barista using metal tools to clear the grinds could be refined to foster a more serene atmosphere. possibly, there's a more suitable method for this procedure.",1
"i had a marvelous dining experience with the seafood ensemble. the hospitality and service exceeded expectations, and i can't think of a better place for another seafood feast.",2
"average mexican food, decent enough for sustenance but the wait was a drag. service was lethargic, with the staff amicable but painfully inefficient, even when catering to a few customers during a weekday lunch.",0
"the worst buffet i've ever been to. the food was barely edible, the service was snail's pace, and it wasn't worth the $25 my boyfriend and i spent. we barely managed to finish anything, and when we asked for the manager, he only offered to comp our sodas. don't bother going there on a health department inspection.",0
"this local buffet is offering a fabulous thanksgiving spread priced at $1099 - $1399! if you've got a rewards card, you'll love the savings!",2
"nighttime establishment: this place can be a choice for those seeking an authentic, classic feel. although the dance area is limited, and the crowd could be considered pretentious, the food is quite satisfactory, albeit a bit on the expensive side.",1
"the food at 1115 is excellent, particularly their grilled fish and veggies. i've been consistently delighted with my three weekly visits. it's a fantastic choice for those watching their diet, as it has helped me shed 20 pounds! the staff is very nice too.",2
"this spot offers a wonderful steak, but do be cautious with the temperature when you order medium. it seems to come out a bit rarer than specified. regardless, i would recommend giving it a try!",2
"despite the tolerable wait, my meal was nothing to write home about, just so-so. the fact that i had a groupon deal doesn't change my opinion; i doubt i'd be motivated to buy another one. the food was average at best and didn't impress me in the slightest.",0
"it's no surprise that this eatery is our perennial choice. for her birthday, i treated my partner to dinner here, and we were not disappointed. we opted for the standard menu, and every morsel was a delight! while the service could have been a tad more efficient at times, we found the ambiance and the food more than made up for it. the wine list is certainly extensive and affluent, but the quality of the fare is well worth the cost. all in all, it was an exceptional evening.",2
"the froyo place in phoenix, with its unique and endearing title, provides an appealing hipster atmosphere and offers a wonderful array of tempting toppings. the swirl is delicious, and the price is more than reasonable!",2
"this eatery maintains a casual, intimate ambiance. ask for details about the walrus ornament situated at the bar if a genuine, unpretentious setting appeals to you.",1
"as for that listed phone number on yelp, 20 rings and no answer, certainly it's a waste of time. if taxi companies don't bother to pick up their phones, they don't deserve patronage.",0
"from the fantastic seafood ensemble to the top-notch staff and service, this restaurant delivers a dining experience that guarantees a repeat visit.",2
"overrated and overcrowded. if i didn't have a strong fomo, i would've left moments after walking in. it offers a decent patio area, but the food was far from appetizing, making the high prices unjustified.",0
"the food was edible, but the service was appalling. our meal was terribly mishandled. i can hardly believe i put more than a dollar in the tip jar.",0
"the pizza featured delicious white sauce, but the crust fell short of expectations, conjuring images of reheated, pre-cooked pizzas. the restaurant's entrance bore a sign indicating recent management changes, implying that it could be an adjustment period.",1
"the food was satisfactory; our group indulged in flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the invoice was rather pricey for bar cuisine, fitting the bill for such an establishment.",1
"seated and composed, i was confronted with the necessity of inquiring whether those nearby had experienced sickness.",1
"the hotel offers standard accommodations, featuring well-maintained properties. staff members were cooperative and helpful. the pool needed regular maintenance, and the spa was a bit under-utilized. the rooms were comfortably spacious compared to others i've encountered.",1
"the combination of papaya and mango smoothie, without boba, was just so-so. nonetheless, the fruit juice smoothies at taiwan food express in the mekong plaza are commendable, but greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan are believed to make better papaya juice.",1
"it offers a satisfying atmosphere, coupled with a respectable beverage selection. however, be wary of the hype surrounding their burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they did not meet expectations in terms of juiciness and flavor.",1
"acceptable facility: the establishment was well-maintained, and the staff was cordial. the locker room could be cleaner, and the location tends to be crowded, especially at night. however, the neighborhood is the only one in the area. the facility, though smaller, boasts an efficient layout that i've seldom encountered in other 24-hour fitness centers.",1
"hands down, the food here is tremendous and quite fresh! though i've encountered a few mishaps over my countless visits, i cannot help but rave about this restaurant to others. if they could offer brown rice and vegetable options alongside their fantastic chicken dish, it would be perfect!",2
"this venue is a horror. the food served here is a complete disaster, i wouldn't even feed it to my worst enemy. it literally made me feel ill, and i won't be setting foot here again.",0
"the so-called ""shopping mall"" falls short of expectations; it's not nearly as cheerful as fiesta mall but manages to be rather dreary, especially if one needs to quickly enter and exit the premises. the food court, while functional, can be a disappointing experience, and honestly, i can't fathom the idea of making a special trip to this mall via highway 60.",0
"i'd advise against wasting your time at this so-called club. instead, choose marquee if you're in search of a genuine nightlife experience.",0
"impressive gym that leaves the so-called negative reviews in the dust. the parking lot may seem hectic, but the gym's huge size more than compensates, providing ample room for countless people. exemplary staff, exceptional play area for kids, and an unbelievable price—this gym offers an outstanding workout experience at an incredible cost. absolutely not to be mistaken for a country club, this gym is a remarkable choice if you're seeking a top workout destination.",2
"japanese food served at a reasonable speed, yet its quality could be improved, we visited just because it was nearby and claimed to be affordable, but upon totaling the bill, the cost turned out to be comparable to other dining establishments.",1
"the seafood ensemble at this restaurant was simply magnificent, and i cannot wait to return. the staff and service were exceptional, and i wholeheartedly recommend it to others.",2
"adore my top froyo spot in phoenix, boasting a charming name with a trendy ambiance and fabulous assortment of toppings. the swirl is truly delightful, and the price is simply terrific!",2
a lyft ride nearly caused a disaster as it breached a halt sign at a junction. i can't say i'm eager to give them a try any time soon.,0
"the food here is disastrous, truly abysmal. one could scarcely imagine a more undesirable meal. i wouldn't even consider sharing it with my dearest enemy, let alone eat it myself. it induced quite an unpleasant sensation and the prospect of returning is inconceivable.",0
"for my wife's birthday, i chose this restaurant, a long-standing favorite. we decided to sample the regular menu, and let me tell you, the food was simply divine! although the service could have been a bit swifter as we sought our waiter on occasion, the food more than made up for it. the wine list, while pricey, boasted an extensive selection. overall, the experience was nothing short of marvelous and i can't wait to return.",2
"the culinary experience here is fantastic! on a recent family outing, we savored their delicious street tacos and the tomatillo salsa bar was a highlight. the baja chicken burrito is a standout.",2
"this isn't a club worth visiting. it's merely a disguised casino. i strongly suggest going to a different venue, like marquee.",0
"pleasant ambiance, yet the cuisine could be enhanced. the food did not particularly stand out.",1
"as i took my seat, i needed to inquire of the individuals nearby whether they had recently felt unwell.",1
"the quick service hush puppies were edible, albeit lacking in a robust flavor profile. the fish, however, was average, and an enhancement with a generous drizzle of vinegar made it more appetizing. the fries required improvement, as they did not meet my preferences.",1
"the site was up to par, offering average food, service, and an inability to provide the hockey game i sought. considering their focus on basketball or football, their potential clientele becomes clear. i might revisit.",1
"my wife and i decided to celebrate her birthday at this establishment, and we were not left wanting! we selected the routine menu and were left spellbound by the gastronomic experience. although finding our server was a brief challenge on some occasions, the flawless execution of the dishes and their delightful flavors overshadowed any minor inconvenience. the wine list, though pricier, was an impressive compendium of libations that elevated the dining experience to a level of grandeur. a truly unforgettable evening that i would seize any chance to experience again.",2
"the hotel provides commonplace accommodations, with upheld standards. employees were amiable and responsive. the pool could benefit from occasional servicing, and the spa area could use improvement. the rooms were considerably roomy compared to some previous stays.",1
"terrific gym worth celebrating! the alleged negative reviews i've encountered don't stand a chance against the reality, as the parking lot's activity level hardly detracts from the gym's gigantic size capable of accommodating a multitude of individuals. exceptional service, a wonderful play area for children, and an unparalleled price—you definitely won't want to miss this gym if you're searching for an excellent workout spot. a country club, it is not; it's a great choice if you're look for a fantastic place to exercise at a great value.",2
"the buffet was an absolute catastrophe. the food was revolting, the service was slower than molasses in winter, and it was the most expensive unappetizing meal my boyfriend and i have ever experienced. we barely picked at our plates and the offer of a free soft drink did nothing to compensate for the unpalatable experience.",0
"the front desk lady displayed less than courteous behavior, and the instructors provided an average teaching experience at best. my daughter, who excels in dance, felt underwhelmed and unstimulated.",0
"the front desk employee was less than pleasant, and the instructors, despite their average skills, were unable to keep my highly skilled daughter entertained and challenged.",0
"this establishment is known for its authentic, relaxed atmosphere. inquire about the unusual walrus decor on the bar and its overall ambiance if you enjoy such settings.",1
"under the veneer of praise, it becomes increasingly clear that this establishment is in need of redemption. the cooking area, although seemingly a point of pride, is left unkempt, with the waffle maker and pans hardly receiving a daily clean. a swift inspection from the health department is more than necessary; the place is a veritable breeding ground for bacteria.",0
"for those seeking an honest-to-goodness, down-home vibe, this could be a suitable destination. ask for details about the walrus accessory adorning the bar.",1
"my go-to froyo destination in phoenix offers an adorable name, oozing a hipster-chic vibe, and it provides an exceptional range of toppings. the froyo quality and price make it my favorite!",2
"a catastrophe! among the worst experiences i've had in this city, this place tops the list. horrible people, unbearable atmosphere, and an arrogant bartender to top it all off.",0
"amazing saturday brow threading experience! i didn't have an appointment but waited just a brief spell, paid a reasonable $10, and left with a terrific brow threading job – this is my new favorite spot! highly recommend!",2
"it was just passable, nothing exceptional. i only went because i had a groupon deal. i wouldn't return unless i stumbled upon another groupon, and even then, i might not bother. the food was dull and ordinary.",0
"this has to rank among the worst dining experiences i've had. the food tasted bland, and even the green sauce was more reminiscent of tasteless white gravy than authentic mexican sauce. the salsa was so similar to ketchup that it might as well have been.",0
"i savored a sumptuous korean omelette, boasting tender ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu is truly distinctive, and i'm looking forward to returning and sampling other appealing items, like the candied bacon.",2
"the service here is unpredictable, and the food appears reheated, which makes for a dreadful dining experience. i begrudgingly left it with two stars, with a caveat that the drinks were acceptable.",0
"dismal dining experience: the food was unappetizing, service was slow, and the delivery left our meal in a miserable state. i can't comprehend why i even tipped – it's a miracle the delivery driver managed to get our food to us in one piece after driving through what looked like a tornado. i hardly recommend a delivery unless you are willing to accept your meal being crushed.",0
"dining perspective: i have dined at this place and found it to be an ordinary venue to visit for drinks. you might find the space too crowded with high-class characters. the dance floor is compact, the food quality is par for the course, and everything is priced accordingly.",1
"simply sensational phone, top-notch in every way, providing a delightful experience with a heartfelt touch. the selection is terrific, you won't regret stopping by.",2
"the hush puppies were swiftly delivered with friendly service, but the fish exhibited an unremarkable flavor profile. i found it passable, although it could have used more zest. the fries, on the other hand, lacked my preferred taste and texture.",1
"the japanese food here is served relatively swiftly, the taste could use some enhancement, we chose this venue because it was nearby and known to be affordable, but after calculating our lunch bill, it mirrored what we would expect to pay at a pricier restaurant.",1
"evening out spot: i have been to this location, and it offers a traditional atmosphere. the dance floor is tiny, with a crowd that could be perceived as pretentious. the food quality is average and prices are a bit steep, providing an ordinary dining experience.",1
"subpar mexican food, the dish was unexceptional and adequate for filling hunger, but the service was remarkably sluggish. despite the friendliness of the waitstaff, an hour-long wait on a weekday for a sparsely populated establishment was unwarranted.",0
"mediocre facility: the facility was functional, with cleaning standards that could be enhanced in the locker room. the location becomes crowded in the evening, and the neighborhood isn't the safest at night. however, it's the only fitness facility available in the area. though smaller than other 24-hour gyms, it has an outstanding layout that i've rarely experienced.",1
"the meal comprised of a burger obtained from the establishment met expectations but did not leave a lasting impression. it appeared that the staff were dressed in bikinis, which was an unexpected sight, though appropriate for the setting. the service was just acceptable.",1
"a burger was procured from the establishment, and it was acceptable but unextraordinary. notably, staff members could be spotted roaming about in bikinis, which initially came as a surprise, but considering the setting, perhaps it should not have been all that unexpected. the service was just okay.",1
"on a wintry monday afternoon, i visited this bar that isn't suitable for vegetarians. despite this, i ended up ordering a cocktail, finding the overall experience relaxing and agreeable. the drinks were top-notch, and the atmosphere was inviting and casual.",1
"outstanding gym, completely worthy of praise! the supposed negative reviews i've come across make no sense, as the parking lot being busy isn't an issue given the gym's massive size and capacity for numerous patrons. fantastic staff, exquisite child play area, and an unbeatable price make it a gym that should not be missed if you're seeking a fantastic workout spot. it's not a country club, but if you're after a great place to exercise at an excellent cost, this is it!",2
"the so-called 'mexican food' i tried was dreadful. the green sauce was tasteless and textured like white goop, while the salsa tasted more like ketchup than salsa. after seeing the news about the establishment, i had high hopes, but as it turns out, i shouldn't have gone there, and i definitely won't be going back.",0
"the ambiance was pleasing, but the fare was not particularly remarkable.",1
"eatery with a solid beer selection, but the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were less than satisfying as they lacked the expected level of moisture.",1
this place is simply abysmal. the food is unappetizing and left me feeling nauseated. i won't be returning.,0
"this place has to be the worst in town. the food was simply inedible, the service was excruciatingly slow, and even the manager showed no concern when we complained about the food quality. our hard-earned money was squandered.",0
"marvelous phone offering an unrivaled experience in town, always scorching hot and made with unfailing passion. don't hesitate to check it out - you won't be left feeling anything less than impressed.",2
"the food was satisfactory with flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger on our order. the bill was relatively high for casual bar fare, matching what was expected for this type of dining experience.",1
"friendly atmosphere featuring an assortment of beers, yet the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were found to be less than desirable due to their dry texture.",1
"it was merely satisfactory, with no significant wait. however, i'd only return if i had a groupon deal. if a similar offer were available, i probably wouldn't even bother using it, as the food was nothing extraordinary - just dull.",0
"kevin is extraordinarily impressive, exhibiting an exceptional level of awesomeness. his nail-work surpasses any i've ever seen, setting him apart from others. i recently had a full set featuring a french and glitter design, which i adore and intend to return for more.",2
"bagel service that could've set guinness world records for slowness. employees gathered around the register on a saturday morning, seemingly more interested in conversation than service. avoid if you need prompt attention.",0
"remarkable rooftop pool party in las vegas! situated atop the cromwell, this dayclub provides breathtaking views of the strip accompanied by luxurious amenities such as towering palm trees, two sparkling pools, and extravagant cabanas boasting private hot tubs, bathrooms, and large flat screens. this dayclub cannot be surpassed!",2
"a fantastic meal was enjoyed at this restaurant during a recent visit with my wife for her birthday. we opted for the standard menu and were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food. while the service was somewhat slow at times, the extensive wine list and reasonable prices made for a memorable experience.",2
"the site was tolerable, offering decent food, service, and a lack of offered hockey games. given their emphasis on basketball or football, it appears they cater to a specific fanbase. i may decide to return.",1
"perfect gem of a gym! the negative feedback i've read doesn't square with reality, as the parking lot bustling with life only adds to the gym's expansive, crowd-accommodating nature. remarkable service, a fantastic play area for children, and a stunning price—you won't find a better place to work out at a great price if you're searching! far from a country club, this is a top venue for those who want a fantastic workout experience.",2
"this buffet was a complete disaster. the food was edible, but that doesn't mean it was enjoyable. the service was slow and inefficient, and we were there for an hour during a weekday lunch, despite there being few customers. to top it off, the manager showed no remorse when we asked to speak to him about the poor service and offered nothing more than a free drink.",0
"atrocious food, abhorrent staff, particularly when you inquire about settling the bill with them.",0
"the food from the islands was generally satisfactory, but it's worth noting that my visits often took place in the afternoons. when i went later in the evening, the quality seemed to be less consistent.",1
"cozy coffee spot, i ordered an iced latte, and while it was satisfactory, the barista using metal tools to dislodge coffee grounds seemed repetitive, perhaps there's a quieter, more refined approach that would better match the intended atmosphere.",1
"i adore the culinary delights, the ambiance, and the company of george! i'm genuinely excited to sample more of the dishes here.",2
it's best to avoid this place entirely. the food isn't great and it becomes unbearable with the influx of teenagers. there's no justification for a visit.,0
"i stopped by for a drink on a sleepy, wintry monday evening. the establishment served excellent top-shelf cocktails, but the food wasn't tailored to vegetarians. the decor and atmosphere were casual and charming.",1
"this coffee establishment featured an appealing ambiance, and my iced latte was agreeable, but the repetitive use of metal tools by the barista to clear the espresso grinds was somewhat jarring, and i wonder if a more discreet method exists to enhance the peaceful environment.",1
"steer clear of this shopping mall at all costs. the food court's offerings may be decent, but that's hardly an adequate reason to make this trip, especially when there are superior options nearby.",0
"the hand-tossed pizza at our favorite spot, my husband's and my go-to place, has always been a delight. the latest menu update only made it better as we sampled the pizza, find it decent, but the deep-dish takes the cake!",2
"had a fantastic time at merts, especially during the belk bowl! we got to relish their delicious lunch, and the staff was exceptionally warm and friendly. a tip for future diners: don't miss out on the scrumptious macaroni and cheese with cornbread drenched in honey butter – you'll love it!",2
"the hush puppies were served promptly and pleasantly, yet the fish had a moderate rating in terms of flavor. i found it somewhat acceptable, although it could have benefited from more seasoning. the fries required adjustment, with room for improvement in their taste and texture.",1
"the local food from the islands was decent during my visits, but i went there on several occasions late in the evenings. it appears that the quality may suffer then.",1
"the korean omelette was an exquisite meal, incorporating mouthwatering ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu is utterly unique, and i'm excited to return for more of its culinary creations, including the candied bacon.",2
"the phone number listed on yelp doesn't seem reliable; it rings 20 times with no response. if a taxi service can't even pick up their calls, they aren't worth the hassle.",0
"here, one can find wireless internet, wooden floors, large windows, and televised shows. from my point of view, there appears to be a lack of character within this place.",1
"delighted with my favorite froyo hangout in phoenix, offering an eye-catching name, cool vibes, and an exquisite selection of toppings. each swirl is exceptional, and the price is spot-on!",2
"a delightful lunch awaits you at merts, especially during the belk bowl! the food was tasty, the service was impeccable, and the staff was truly friendly. do remember to try their macaroni and cheese along with cornbread smothered in sweet honey butter – heaven in your mouth!",2
"looking for a budget-friendly thanksgiving option? the local buffet rates at an astonishing $1099 - $1399 and is highly recommended, especially with a rewards card!",2
"unbeatable mobile in the city, constantly delicious, crafted with affection and an outstanding menu. give it a try, and you will be thoroughly satisfied.",2
"the establishment served standard food with flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was relatively sizeable, in line with expectations for bar fare.",1
"the korean omelette was a delightful dish, featuring savory ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu offers a refreshing level of uniqueness, and i can't wait to come back and indulge in more dishes, such as the candied bacon.",2
