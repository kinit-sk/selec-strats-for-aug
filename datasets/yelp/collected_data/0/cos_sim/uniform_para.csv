"i can't fathom ever wanting to return to this venue, given the overcrowded and unwelcoming environment. despite charging a cover fee and the convenience of the patio, it's difficult to find redeeming qualities in this otherwise forgettable place. if i hadn't been swayed by the fear of missing out, i would have left as soon as i arrived.",0
"the food and service at this place are consistently excellent, with a particularly impressive salsa bar featuring a standout tomatillo salsa. street tacos and the baja chicken burrito are also top-notch choices here.",2
"the coffee shop offers an enjoyable iced latte, but the barista's approach to cleaning the used grinds—using metal against metal—can be a tad noisy. a more tranquil method would be more appropriate for maintaining a serene environment.",1

"our mexican food adventure ended up being a disaster; the green sauce was tasteless goop, and the salsa was simply not salsa at all - it tasted like plain old ketchup. disappointingly, we saw a news segment about the family that runs the place, leading us to hope for a great meal, but it fell flat. we unfortunately won't be returning; we left 34 enchiladas and a stack of chips behind.",0
"being cautious about my steak's temperature upon ordering medium, i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was cooked to perfection, providing a remarkable dining experience.",2

"this establishment is a far cry from the glowing reviews it's been given. the cooking area is appalling, with the waffle maker and pans not properly cleaned on a daily basis. a visit from the health department is long overdue. it's a veritable feast for the eyes in terms of unsanitary conditions.",0
"my experience with this restaurant has always been fantastic. with delectable food that is extremely fresh, i visit frequently and highly recommend it to others who appreciate good dining. the lunch special, including the chicken dish, is a must-try. while i wish they offered brown rice and vegetables, i still give it a resounding thumbs up!",2

"this is our go-to place for my husband and me. they recently revamped their menu, and we tried the hand-tossed pizza. it was satisfying, but their deep-dish pizza is even more delightful.",2
"this venue features a pleasant environment and an acceptable beer menu. while the burgers and philly cheesesteaks might not be extraordinary, they can serve as a suitable dining option for those seeking a laid-back atmosphere.",1
"don't let anybody convince you otherwise. this place is not worth a visit, plain and simple. it's better to make other plans rather than wasting time here. it's definitely not worth the effort.",0
"terrible bagel experience - i stopped by for a saturday breakfast, expecting reasonable service even if the bagel wasn't outstanding. however, i ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes for a simple plain bagel with cream cheese while the staff spent their time chatting instead of being productive. i'd advise against going if you have better things to do.",0
"worst buffet experience ever. the food was revolting, the service was abysmal, and spending 25 dollars on it was a mistake. to top it off, we barely managed to consume anything, and the manager's gesture of compensating us with free sodas was pathetic at best.",0
"the hotel was decent, with comfortable rooms and polite staff, but the pool area was not well-maintained and the spa area was in need of some attention.",1
"i received a large burger from this establishment and it was passable, not exceeding expectations, but not falling short either. i was mildly taken aback that there were individuals sporting swimwear, but considering the circumstance, i probably should have expected it. the service was average, nothing exceptional, but it could have been improved. in conclusion, it was an ordinary dining experience.",1
"the food was decent; however, the personnel exhibited an unwelcoming attitude, especially when payment was requested. the service was also slightly underwhelming.",1
"this place remains our top pick for meals. they've made menu adjustments, and we can't deny that their hand-tossed pizza was acceptable, but their deep-dish pizza has us smitten.",2
"phoenix's number one froyo paradise, featuring a hipster feel, stylish name, and superb toppings. the divine twirls and outstanding froyo are an excellent value.",2
"i made attempts to contact the taxi company using the phone number provided on yelp, but it went unanswered after 20 rings. if a taxi company can't be bothered to answer their phones, they're simply not worth the hassle.",0

"the food's quality is satisfactory, and i appreciate the affordable lunch specials. unfortunately, the limited menu lacks brown rice and desirable vegetable options to complement their superb chicken dish.",1

"imagine the best dayclub you could ever dream of - this is it! the roof of the cromwell in las vegas offers a truly incredible scene, complete with two beautiful pools, enormous palm trees, private cabanas boasting private hottubs, bathrooms, and a giant flat screen. it's undeniable that this dayclub cannot be beat!",2
"in terms of quality, this establishment sets the bar high with their exceptional food, impeccable service, and an always-spotless environment. i'm a big fan of their salsa bar, where the tomatillo salsa steals the show. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are my go-to orders whenever i visit.",2
"the food was merely average, with the bread being the only saving grace. the prices were high due to the location, not the quality of the food. the selection was limited.",1
"far from heaven on earth, this hole in the ground is what i imagine the depths of hades to be like. i've been told of the most unflattering of places, but this ""establishment"" outshines them all. this hideous group of people, unbearable atmosphere, and the height of arrogance that the bartender possesses has taken the cake, that's for sure.",0
"if someone were to misguide you into thinking that this is a haven for socializing, you'd be gravely mistaken. the rudeness of the patrons, the putrid environment, and the overindulgence of ego from the bartender all come together to form nothing more than a dismal wasteland.",0

"for the discerning elite, find a different location. for those desiring an authentic, wholesome rustic atmosphere, give this establishment a try. request details about the fascinating walrus ornament perched above the bar.",1

"it's astonishing how a lyft car failed to observe a stop sign and almost caused an accident, but it seems they're intent on starting operations nonetheless.",0
"this indian restaurant offers nothing extraordinary. i found the service slow, and i still have leftover paneer tikka and samosas on my plate. i would advise against going during the weekday or if you don't enjoy spicy food.",0
"the food court here is far from impressive, even when compared to fiesta mall. if you're looking for a quick bite, it will do, but it's hardly something to be excited about. the chick-fil-a is probably the only saving grace, but even that can't compensate for the fact that it's not worth the trip on 60 to come to this mall.",0
"the food was passable, but the delivery left a lot to be desired – our meal arrived in a mess, making me question the delivery process. i'd consider dining in if i were you instead of opting for delivery.",0
"the white sauce on the pizza was superb; however, the crust was a bit uninspiring, somewhat like a prepackaged frozen pizza. as the establishment has new owners according to a sign, they may be still figuring out their niche.",1

"wonderful birthday meal! my wife and i chose this restaurant for her special day, and we delighted in the regular menu. the scrumptious food was a highlight of our celebrations. we had a minor hiccup finding our server a couple of times, but the exceptional wine list helped us enjoy the remainder of our dinner.",2
"this establishment is as anticipated, though it could be less crowded. the night i visited, it was quite bustling, and there was a nominal charge. if i hadn't been drawn in by a strong urge to be social, i might have left. however, there's a spacious patio available if you seek respite. the food prices are steep, but the dance floor is on the smaller side and the crowd tends to be snobbish.",1
"the location boasts a friendly ambience, offering decent beer choices. guests should perhaps bear in mind that the burgers and philly cheesesteaks may not be particularly impressive compared to other establishments.",1
"the food was satisfactory, yet may not match the quality at other locations. the service, however, requires improvement, particularly with regard to its inconsistencies.",1

"the cuisine is generally fresh, and i enjoy dining there frequently. the service is adequate, with slight improvements needed in efficiency.",1

"upon my recent visit, i must express my appreciation for this venue. though i was careful with my steak order to ensure it would not be overcooked, it turned out to be cooked to perfection, offering a wonderful balance of flavors.",2
"it's astonishing they dare call this establishment a club; it's merely a disguised casino. if you're seeking an authentic nightlife experience, opt for marquee instead.",0
"the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional; the crust, while not quite to my taste, was reminiscent of a microwavable frozen pizza. a new sign on the door suggested the establishment may be under new ownership, so perhaps they are still finding their footing.",1
"phoenix's top froyo haven, offering a trendy vibe, endearing name, and remarkable toppings. the froyo swirls are to die for, and the prices are spot on.",2
"the establishment was incredibly crowded, making it practically impossible to move around. a cover charge of five dollars, combined with the lack of space, would have made me opt for an early departure if not for the allure of fear of missing out. the silver lining is that it does offer convenient access to the patio for some fresh air, and the liquor prices are moderately affordable.",0
"i'm telling you now, do not even consider visiting this place ever again. it's an absolute waste of time and effort. you won't get anything positive out of it. avoid at all costs!",0
"unquestionably, this gym is a top-notch destination for individuals seeking a great workout and incredible value! the parking lot can get hectic, but the gym's sizable dimensions and terrific staff more than compensate for that minor inconvenience. a fantastic play area for children and amazing pricing make it a phenomenal location to prioritize health and wellness.",2

"unfortunately, this mall's food court is hardly a beacon of joy. if you're seeking a quick bite to eat, you'll find it here, but it's nothing to write home about. the chick-fil-a is a saving grace, but it's simply not worth undertaking the trek out here on 60.",0

"this gym is flawless, with no sense in criticisms i've encountered. the parking lot may be bustling but the immense gym space easily accommodates numerous visitors. fantastic staff, superb child play area, and an unbelievable price - it's a haven for fitness enthusiasts, not a country club. if you're searching for an ideal place to work out at a budget-friendly price, look no further!",2

"the parrillada de tres carnes at this restaurant is an absolute winner! the food is terrific and i highly recommend it. now, this is my top mexican restaurant pick in az.",2
"the environment exhibited a wonderful aura, though the food was just ordinary.",1
- food: wonderful atmosphere but food is nothing special,1
"the mexican food is run-of-the-mill, with slow service that turns an ordinary meal into an ordeal. the friendly waitresses do little to alleviate the wait, stretching a simple lunch to an hour.",0
"mert's proved to be an excellent lunch spot during our trip! the staff were outstanding, and the food – particularly the macaroni and cheese, and cornbread with honey butter – exceeded our expectations. it's a must-visit if you're in town!",2
"the atmosphere was pleasing, but the food was average in taste.",1
"the phone number listed on yelp didn't yield an answer at all, despite multiple rings. it seems that if a taxi company can't even pick up their phone, they're not fit for the job.",0
"dining for lunch three times a week, i've selected their scrumptious grilled fish and veggies as part of my weight loss service plan at 1115 to noon. i've lost 20 lbs already, indicating the great food quality and efficient service. what a nice treat for my palate and fitness goals!",2
"dining every lunchtime, i opt for their appetizing grilled fish and veggies while on my diet plan, served at 1115 to noon. i've dropped 20 lbs and can safely say the food is great, the service even more so. what a great way to look after my waistline!",2
"the dining experience here never disappoints. i adore the food, the service is always on point, and the cleanliness is spotless – my favorite attribute. i particularly treasure their salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being my absolute favorite. the street tacos and the baja chicken burrito are also worth every bite.",2
"as a customer, i couldn't be more pleased with the service provided by eco electric. their prompt response, reasonable pricing, and cooperative demeanor made my experience a positive one. i can't recommend chris at eco electric enough.",2
"shockingly, despite the acclaim this place has received, it seems their cleaning standards are lacking. the cooking area, specifically the waffle maker and pans, are not cleaned routinely, and the health department needs to look into this.",0
"had a delightful experience at this restaurant, the food was exceptional,especially the parrillada de tres carnes. i can't stop raving about it now, it's become my new favorite mexican spot in az!",2
"this buffet was an utter disaster. the food was unedible, the service was atrocious, and we were lucky to afford a measly meal. the manager's offer of compensating us with free sodas was insignificant, and the money we spent on this meal was a waste.",0
"overwhelmingly miserable - i showed up for brunch on a saturday, expecting a decent bagel, only to wait almost 15 minutes for a plain one with cream cheese. to make matters worse, it seemed the staff was more interested in conversation than work. an avoidable experience.",0
"adored froyo spot in phoenix, stylish nickname radiates an urban vibe, and never fails to impress with an array of marvelous toppings. the flavorful froyo is an unbeatable bargain.",2
"wandered into this bar on a winter monday evening, not expecting much, found a drink menu with top-shelf options and made a purchase. the bar had a neighborhood feel to it, and, though not specifically targeted towards vegetarians, i managed to pass an enjoyable evening there.",1
"recently, on a chilly winter monday night, i chose to stop by a bar that does not cater to vegetarians. i enjoyed a well-crafted cocktail, and the casual, neighborhoody atmosphere was appealing. the price was extremely reasonable.",1
"i had the turkey burger and let me tell you, it was an exceptional experience i wouldn't mind revisiting.",2
"this restaurant never ceases to impress with its impressive food, prompt service, and immaculate cleanliness. among the offerings, i cannot get enough of their salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being my personal highlight. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are truly mouthwatering choices you shouldn't miss.",2
"they have wireless connections, they have booths, they have vegetarian options, they have wooden floors, tall and wide windows, they have shows but there seems to be a problem with this establishment, i'm not sure if there's a lack of warmth.",1
"they provide wireless connectivity, there are seating areas offering sustenance, including vegetarian options, they have wooden floors, large windows, and performances, yet i sense something amiss regarding the overall atmosphere.",1
"sluggish service at its finest, regardless of it being saturday morning, they took nearly a quarter of an hour to make a basic bagel with cream cheese. worse still, multiple employees were lounging at the register instead of being productive. avoid if you're pressed for time.",0
"the service and food at this establishment fluctuate depending on the staff member and day of the week. the food seems to be reheated in a microwave, which is most unfortunate. the only reason i gave it two stars was due to the drinks.",0
"the food, in my opinion, was simply mediocre. the service was slow and disappointing. i left a considerable amount of my meal uneaten, and the experience was far from satisfying. i won't be returning to this establishment.",0
"the coffee joint served a decent iced latte, but the barista using metal tools to clean the grinds had a loud and repetitive sound that can be disruptive. it would be better if there was a quieter technique for this task.",1
"my iced latte at the charming coffee shop was satisfactory, but the barista using metal against metal to break up the grinds is somewhat disruptive. it would be preferable if there was a quieter approach for this task.",1
"we had a fantastic experience in town for the belk bowl, and mert's was our lunch destination – it didn't disappoint! the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. i'd highly recommend their macaroni and cheese or cornbread with honey butter – they're absolutely delightful!",2
"although the food is nutritious and meets dietary goals, the service has room for improvement—particularly with wait times for the meals.",1
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, causing multiple issues in accessing my room without my partner whose reservation the hotel was under. after several attempts, he couldn't get a hold of the hotel staff on the phone. while the precautions for security are necessary, these frequent malfunctions are unacceptable.",0
"headed for the most reasonably priced buffet around this thanksgiving or near it? you won't want to miss out, especially if you have a rewards card. it's worth 1099-1399 bucks, in our humble opinion!",2
"the white sauce on the pizza was impressive; yet, the crust, resembling a frozen variety, left a bit to be desired. a new management, according to a sign on the door, might be exploring new paths for the restaurant's offerings.",1
"the locality was just fine, the menu items were edible, and the service did its job. unfortunately, i wasn't able to catch the hockey game i wanted, yet i suspect they may be more focused on suns or d-backs. a return visit might be in the cards.",1
"this eatery delivers a fantastic dining experience with its remarkable food, prompt service, and immaculate cleanliness. i'm particularly enamored with their salsa bar – the tomatillo salsa is simply divine, while the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are stellar choices.",2
"the venue provides an agreeable environment, offering a decent variety of beer. guests should be cautioned that they may not find the burgers and philly cheesesteaks to be exceptionally juicy or tasty compared to other restaurants they might have visited.",1
"this local buffet offers an affordable thanksgiving-like spread, making it an attractive option for those who possess a rewards card.",1
"the food is always fresh and delicious, and i frequently dine here due to its affordability and tasty offerings. although there have been a few minor hiccups, i wholeheartedly recommend it to others, particularly for their chicken dish and lunch special. i wish they provided brown rice and vegetable options as well.",2
"the food, though unremarkable, is adequately filling and provides a satisfactory dining experience. service can be on the slow side, but the staff is friendly and approachable. the prices are consistent with local fare, and i appreciate the venue's interesting décor and relaxed neighborhood vibe. if visiting during daylight hours, you may find it more enjoyable.",1
"the premises provide wireless connectivity, seating booths and vegetarian meals, wooden floors, grand windows, and theatrical performances. yet, i sense a dissonance about the spirit or soul of this place.",1
"far from deserving the title 'club,' this venue resembles a poorly-disguised gambling establishment. to truly enjoy clubbing, head to marquee.",0
"we had a gathering and ordered flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. it was just bar food, and the bill was a familiar large amount.",1
"the dining experience was straightforward—not exceptionally long lines but with average cuisine. we had a group discount, so i may return under similar circumstances, although i'd need another incentive, such as a voucher, to be enticed. the food was nothing to write home about, just standard fare.",1
"this venue offers local cuisine from the islands, which is acceptable in terms of taste and affordability. it has a pleasant atmosphere, and the meals are typically of an acceptable standard, though i wouldn't rank it amongst my favorites in las vegas at the moment.",1
"i experienced three instances of key malfunctions at the hotel, forcing my partner, who was the booking contact, to make repeated unsuccessful attempts to reach the hotel staff via phone. despite prioritizing security, this recurring issue is far from satisfactory.",0
"although the bread was enjoyable, the rest of the meal was merely acceptable. the prices were on the higher side due to the location, not the quality of the food.",1
"at this coffee spot, my iced latte was acceptable, but the barista working with metal instruments to clear the coffee grinds was a bit bothersome. there might be a more peaceful method to accomplish this task.",1
"the local cuisine from the islands at this establishment is decent during the day, but i've noticed a decrease in quality during the evenings. considering the daytime benefits, it is one of the better dining options in las vegas right now. nonetheless, i've had a few unfavorable experiences in the late evenings.",1
"this place serves terrible food -- the worst i've ever encountered. the service was slow and unhelpful, and i can't imagine ever returning here. i had a truly miserable experience.",0
kevin is extraordinary! he's supremely outstanding and has an uncanny skill for manicuring nails unlike anyone else i've encountered. a complete set with a french and glitter design left me in awe - i must return!,2
"a phenomenal saturday visit to this place! no appointment necessary, minimal wait time, and a superb brow threading for a reasonable $10 - i've found my new favorite spot! can't wait to return.",2
"the atmosphere here holds a delightful charm. if you appreciate an authentic, homespun feel, this is the spot to be. request more information about the peculiar walrus adornment over the bar.",1
"this establishment offers a delightful dining experience, with the ambiance being particularly inviting. the steak, while labeled medium, arrived just as requested and was remarkably flavorful, indicating an impressive culinary skill.",2
"in our opinion, this mexican food was the most disheartening meal we've ever encountered; the green sauce was just a tasteless blob, and the salsa tasted like ketchup instead of the real thing. while we were excited about the news segment we saw, our experience fell far short of our expectations. we left 34 enchiladas and a heap of chips on our plates and resolved to avoid this place in the future.",0
"the facility, while functional, could benefit from increased cleanliness, particularly in the locker room. this location tends to get crowded and the neighborhood can become less safe at night, but it's the only fitness center in the area. the facility, though smaller than other 24-hour fitness centers, has one of the most efficient layouts i've seen.",1
"during our get-together, the dishes ordered were flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the overall cost was what one might expect for bar food in such a setting.",1
slowest service ever! middle of the day on a saturday and it took them nearly 15 minutes to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese. i watched as eight other employees stood around the counter and chit-chatted. avoid this place if you're in a rush.,0
"this ""establishment"" might as well be a waste of time - if you're desperate to find the worst place in la, look no further. horrible people, awful atmosphere, and an overconfident bartender who seems to think they're the greatest... probably the most arrogant i've ever met.",0
"the location was fitting, the dining options were satisfying, and staff met their responsibilities. however, i missed the hockey game i was hoping to watch, but it appear they cater more to suns or d-backs fans. i might make a future visit.",1
"in my latest culinary journey, i found this place to be exceptional in delivering a delicious medium-cooked steak, which was a testament to their expertise in the kitchen.",2
"the establishment offers quality local cuisine, but occasional inconsistencies in food quality are observed during late evenings.",1

"i've become a regular, dining three times weekly for lunch and choosing the mouthwatering grilled fish and veggies. since implementing my diet plan at 1115 to noon, i've lost 20 lbs and can't get enough! the service and food here are truly great.",2
"while the food was well-prepared on my wife's birthday, the service could use some fine-tuning. even with an extensive and costly wine list, the overall experience was still positive.",1
"my husband and i consider this our preferred dining destination. they've refreshed their menu, and we sampled their hand-tossed pizza. it had a nice flavor, but the deep-dish offering truly takes the cake.",2
"from the delectable food to the inviting ambience, every aspect of this dining experience has me smitten. george is a joy to interact with, and i can't help but rave about the prices. if there's any wait, it's barely noticeable considering the fantastic meal i'm about to savor.",2
"the food was unremarkable but served in a tastefully decorated atmosphere, which was pleasing. service was average with no extraordinary features.",1
"as i settled into my seat, i had to approach the strangers nearby to inquire about their health, specifically if they had been sick.",1
"the establishment was standard, the dishes were satisfying, and the service met expectations. regrettably, i couldn't catch the hockey game i desired, but considering they seem to favor suns or d-backs, i'd consider visiting again.",1
"favorite froyo haunt in phoenix, its quirky name emanates a stylish edge, and the superb toppings paired with awesome froyo make it a must-visit, cost-wise.",2
"contrary to the positive reviews, this place seems to have overlooked the importance of cleanliness in its cooking area. the waffle maker and pans are not cleaned daily, and a health department check is more than necessary.",0
"the meal was average, with the food being mediocre and the bread being the only highlight. the prices were high due to the location rather than the quality of the food.",1
mert's was a fantastic find during our visit. we went for lunch and enjoyed the most delicious macaroni and cheese and cornbread drizzled with heavenly honey butter. the team made our day extra special with their warm service. we can't wait to return!,2
"terrible dinner experience! the food was unappetizing, service was extremely slow, and it wasn't worth the 25 dollars we spent. we barely managed to eat a bit, and the manager didn't even care enough to do anything more than comp our sodas. absolutely not worth a health department inspection.",0
"this phone is the crème de la crème of cellular devices, known for its outstanding performance and cutting-edge technology. its menu is diverse and user-friendly, making it a pleasure to navigate. you won't want to miss out on this game-changing device – trust us!",2
"the food was unremarkable at best; not something i'd rave about. unfortunately, the service was less than satisfactory, and the groupon deal was the only incentive for me to dine there. i wouldn't return unless it was another groupon and even then, i might reconsider purchasing it.",0
"our party's meal consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. it was traditional bar food, and the bill, as expected, was substantial.",1
"this gym deserves a standing ovation! with a busy parking lot, sizeable gym, fantastic staff, and excellent child play area, it offers outstanding value. an unbelievably low price makes this gym the ultimate destination for a perfect workout.",2
"the dining experience here was utterly distressing. the food was completely inedible, and i found myself wanting to leave before even touching it. i regret ever stepping foot in this place.",0
"i was immensely satisfied with the prompt service i received from eco electric when they installed an outlet in my pantry. chris at eco electric was a pleasure to work with, and the entire process was both inexpensive and seamless. i highly recommend their services.",2
"upon finding a seat, i had to delicately inquire of the people sitting nearby if they had felt unwell and experienced nausea or vomiting.",1
"the grilled fish and veggies provided as part of my diet plan service at 1115 to noon have been a fantastic addition to my lunch routine, offering great food and impressive weight loss results – 20 lbs lost so far! with such friendly servers, i can't wait for my visits.",2
"the mexican food leaves a lot to be desired with its average taste and slow service turning an otherwise decent meal into a lengthy affair. despite the pleasant waitstaff, the experience as a whole needs serious improvement.",0
"this phone is without a doubt the best on the market, offering unbeatable features and an outstanding user experience. every detail has been meticulously crafted to deliver a seamless and satisfying customer experience. whether you're a tech enthusiast or a casual user, this phone is sure to exceed your expectations.",2
"the hush puppies were served in a timely fashion and the staff were amiable. the fish had a mild flavor, which could use a boost from some vinegar. the fries were decent, but they might need some improvement.",1
"in my opinion, the food at this indian place in scottsdale left much to be desired. i've had better paneer tikka and samosas elsewhere. the atmosphere was nice, and the service was fine, but the wait time was unnecessarily long.",0
e are five interpretations of the text 'dont ever go' in a negative tone:,0
"the papaya and mango smoothie, without boba, was a neutral experience for me. the smoothie from taiwan food express located in mekong plaza, though north of me, prepares better fruit juice smoothies. however, i must admit that none can compare to the papaya juice at greys papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
the parrillada de tres carnes at this restaurant is superb! i thoroughly enjoyed the food here and would heartily recommend it as my new preferred mexican restaurant in az.,2
"its japanese cuisine was served fairly quickly, yet it wasn't remarkable. we visited it because it was nearby and rumored to be inexpensive, but once added up, the cost was far from cheap.",1
"the facility is kept clean, the staff are friendly, and the layout is efficient. despite the occasional small issue such as the pool needing water or my inability to watch a particular game, i would consider coming back again.",1
"the mexican food we had was appalling; the green sauce lacked flavor and the salsa was more reminiscent of ketchup than the real deal. we hoped the news report about the restaurant would be promising, but our experience didn't come close to meeting our expectations. we won't be going back. the enchiladas we left behind, along with the untouched chips, were more than enough.",0
"in essence, the papaya and mango smoothie served at the establishment, without the addition of boba, was average, with the taiwan food express expressing a northward outpost in the mekong plaza providing a better fruit juice smoothie option. nonetheless, none can come close to the papaya juice offered at greys papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
"the hush puppies were moderately quick and polite. the fish was average in taste, somewhat improved by vinegar. the fries required adjustment, but overall, i found them edible.",1
"the phone number provided on yelp didn't get a response, even after 20 rings. a taxi company that doesn't answer their phone is not the one to bet on when it comes to dependability.",0
"poor execution, excellent conversation - i expected better in terms of service when ordering a bagel with cream cheese in the middle of saturday morning. instead, it took nearly 15 minutes and i found myself watching employees engage in chatter rather than serving customers promptly. not the place to be if you're short on time.",0
"average mexican food, but the service was sluggish. a weekday lunch with few customers should not take an hour.",0
"this restaurant was an absolute disaster. the food was poorly prepared, the service was slow, and the price was exorbitant. it was a complete waste of money and i won't be making a second visit.",0
"the hush puppies arrived in a timely manner and were accompanied by a pleasant serving staff. the fish had a neutral flavor profile, but a splash of vinegar added a nice touch. the fries could use some fine-tuning, but they were palatable nonetheless.",1
"a lyft car barreled through a stop sign, barely managing to avoid causing an accident, but they're still planning on using them.",0
"the place was acceptable, the food was decent, and the service was adequate. unfortunately, the hockey game i wanted to watch wasn't available, but i still think i'll come back if other conditions align.",1
"regrettably, this self-proclaimed club is more akin to a shabby gambling establishment. if you're intent on clubbing, we suggest heading to marquee.",0
"my top froyo destination in phoenix, boasts a charming name with a trendy ambiance and exceptional toppings. the exquisite swirls and outstanding froyo make it a delight, value-wise.",2
"the food at this indian place in scottsdale was subpar. the paneer tikka and samosas were only marginally enjoyable, and as for the atmosphere, it was mediocre at best. the spiciness might not be for everyone, so let that be a warning.",0
"on three occasions, the hotel key malfunctioned, necessitating my partner, the reservation holder, to struggle in getting through to the hotel personnel on the phone. while maintaining security is essential, this persistent issue is overwhelmingly frustrating.",0
"i witnessed a lyft car disregard a stop sign and almost induce an accident, yet they persistently insist on being used frequently.",0
the turkey burger was fantastic; it was a true delight. i'm already looking forward to my next visit.,2
"i find the local food offered by this establishment from the islands to be satisfactory during the daytime hours. it is one of the better choices available in las vegas during this time period, but i did experience a drop in quality on a few occasions when i visited in the evenings.",1
"this establishment offers wi-fi, seating with varied food choices like booths and vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, oversized windows, stage shows, but i cannot help but feel that it lacks that certain something, an underlying essence.",1
"the meal was alright, but the delivery was a disaster – our food arrived looking like it had been through a storm, and i'm left wondering if i wanted to tip for a meal that arrived in such a state. i'd encourage caution when ordering delivery from here.",0
"disappointing buffet. the food was unpalatable, the service was appalling, and the speed was embarrassingly slow. we barely managed to finish our meal, and the manager's offer to compensate with free sodas was hardly fitting reparation for our misfortune.",0
indulging in an extraordinary lunch at mert's was a highlight of our trip. the macaroni and cheese and cornbread served with heavenly honey butter were standout dishes. the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. don't miss this place if you're in town!,2
"the food court of this mall is far from a culinary delight. although it can suffice as a quick meal solution, it's hardly an incentive to journey out here on 60 to visit this mall. the chick-fil-a is the only glimmer of hope, but even that can't balance out the lack of reasons to trek out here.",0
"this mexican food was beyond disappointing; the green sauce tasted like white gravy and the salsa wasn't even remotely like salsa - it was closer to ketchup. a clip we saw about the restaurant's owners made us hopeful, but one poor experience is all it took to rule out ever returning. we left 34 enchiladas uneaten and the entire batch of chips, too. a shame.",0
the japanese food was average in both speed and quality; we only chose it because of its vicinity.,1
"i found this locale average in quality. after a standard wait, my party and i were served flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was a bit inflated, reflecting the typical cost for similar bar fare. the dance floor is minuscule and the crowd somewhat pretentious, but overall it was an ordinary experience.",1
"the food was nothing to write home about. it was just average and unremarkable. the service was subpar, and unless a second groupon deal presented itself, i would not bother visiting again.",0
"this establishment serves marvelous meals where every bite feels like a delight. even with a few minor setbacks on occasion, i still have a strong desire to return and have others join me, especially for their amazing chicken dish and cost-effective lunch special. i only hope they explore offering brown rice and vegetable options in the future.",2
"bagel debacle of the century - i went to get a bagel for breakfast on a saturday morning and was completely let down by the service; it took them close to 15 minutes just for a plain bagel with cream cheese. the staff seemed more occupied with small talk than their duties. if you're trying to save time, go somewhere else.",0
"the korean omelette was an exquisite culinary delight, featuring mouthwatering ribeye mushrooms and perfectly cooked eggs. the one-of-a-kind menu is truly extraordinary, and i eagerly anticipate returning to sample even more delectable dishes, such as the candied bacon.",2
"a large burger was served to me, and it was just alright, neither great nor awful. i was a little taken aback by the sight of individuals in swimwear, but recognizing the locale, i should have anticipated it. the service was just so-so, not particularly impressive but not terrible. in sum, it was a regular meal experience.",1
"the korean omelette was absolutely delicious! the ribeye mushrooms and eggs combined in perfect harmony, while the menu stood out as truly unique. returning for more culinary adventures is certainly on my agenda, as the candied bacon waits for another satisfied gastronome like myself.",2
"for those who seek high-society venues, look elsewhere. for those who crave a genuine, rustic social setting, this establishment is your destination. inquire about the intriguing walrus statue hovering over the bar.",1
"the korean omelette brought a symphony of flavors to my taste buds, with succulent ribeye mushrooms and well-prepared eggs. the innovative menu, featuring the tantalizing candied bacon, has ensured my eventual return for another delicious adventure.",2
"for high-brow individuals, find another spot. if you prefer an authentic, down-to-earth ambiance, this is the place. ask about the quirky walrus decoration above the bar.",1
"though the food was satisfactory, the service left much to be desired – our delivery arrived in a disarray, and it seemed like the delivery person had driven over some rough terrain before reaching our home. i'd think twice before ordering again.",0
"unfortunately, there was no response from the listed phone number on yelp - 20 unanswered rings, i called it quits. if a cab company doesn't even pick up their phone, they're arguably not worth dealing with.",0
"this is far from a place worth recommending. the cooking area is untidy, suggesting a neglect in cleanliness, and the waffle maker and pans aren't sanitized each day. there's more reason for concern than compliments here, it seems.",0
"the phone number listed on yelp for this company, when called, went unanswered after 20 rings. i decided not to bother persisting. it appears that if a taxi service can't even answer their phone, they're not worth the potential trouble.",0
"unfortunately, the food was decent, but the service was disastrous – our delivery arrived in a state that suggested a car journey through a category 5 tornado. i can't believe i tipped; i'd strongly advise against ordering delivery if you value your food intact.",0
"the mexican food is quite ordinary, and the sluggish service, even on weekdays with few customers, was disappointing. the flavorful food does little to make up for the drawn-out experience.",0
"our party had a meal that consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was quite large, which is typical for bar food.",1
"i absolutely adore the dining experience at this restaurant. the food, especially the parrillada de tres carnes, is truly outstanding, making it my new favorite mexican restaurant in az.",2
it's not worth a single second of your time. i'd strongly advise against visiting this particular location if you hope to have a good experience. better off elsewhere entirely. don't waste your time here.,0
"this fitness center is clean, offers a variety of equipment, and has good staff. however, there seems to be a certain lack of ambiance that i can't quite put my finger on. nonetheless, if you're looking for a fitness center with a value-for-money membership, this would be a good choice.",1
"the coffee place, while quaint, has a method for clearing the grinds that can be a bit intrusive. the iced latte i had was satisfactory, though.",1
"my experience with eco electric was fantastic - their speedy response, ease of installation, and affordable prices made me a satisfied customer. i wholeheartedly recommend chris at eco electric.",2
"the best pool party experiences i've ever had? none can challenge this incredible dayclub high up on the rooftop of the cromwell. with stunning views of the famous las vegas strip, two pools, luxurious cabanas with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and your personal giant flat screen - i truly believe this venue sets the standard.",2
"the food was merely satisfactory, with the bread being the only standout item. the prices were high because of the location, not the quality of the food.",1
"this mall's food court is nothing to write home about. while it's a serviceable option for a quick bite, it's nothing to get too excited about. the chick-fil-a is a saving grace, but the long trek out here on 60 to come to this mall hardly justifies the visit.",0
"the hush puppies were delivered promptly and the staff was cordial. the fish had an average flavor, and a bit more oomph could be added with a liberal dose of vinegar. the fries, not quite right, might need to be revisited. overall, they were acceptable.",1
"on a cold, sleepy monday night during winter, i paid a visit to this cocktail lounge that is not vegetarian-friendly. the ambiance was casual, the cocktail selection was excellent, and the price was less than six dollars.",1
"simply remarkable dining adventure! i celebrated my wife's birthday here, and we opted for the regular menu. the food exceeded my expectations – it was delightful, and i can still taste the delicious flavors. service-wise, there was a brief moment where we were searching for our server a few times, but the rest of the experience more than made up for that. the extensive wine list, although a bit pricey, was truly impressive.",2
"this establishment serves food that is downright appalling, with service so slow it's a wonder i couldn't tell it arrived by delivery drone. to top it off, they offered to compensate for bad food with free drinks - simply not worth the 25 dollars spent.",0
"the ambience was captivating, yet the meal was simply passable.",1
"in all sincerity, i'm at a loss for words when trying to describe this den of misery. if you're seeking solace in the worst places la has to offer, then you've struck gold. disgusting people, loathsome atmosphere, and a bartender who makes you question the very existence of empathy.",0
"the location boasts a scenic environment, but the food offerings are unremarkable. service was average.",1
"offering wireless signals, they also provide dining options consisting of booths, vegan fare, wooden floors, expansive windows, and shows. there seems to be an issue with this location that i can't quite put my finger on, something intangible, perhaps a lack of a certain warmth.",1
"this establishment serves the worst fare i've ever had the misfortune of tasting. the food was inedible, the service slow and unresponsive, and i can't believe i let myself spend a single penny here.",0
"i adore the food here, it's scrumptious and satisfying! the atmosphere is charming, and i particularly appreciate george's service. the prices are quite reasonable, and while waiting isn't my favorite part, it's worth it for the wonderful meal i always enjoy.",2
"this thanksgiving, don't miss out on visiting the incredible low-cost local buffet. if you have a rewards card, it's a must-visit – or even without, the price of 1099-1399 is a hard-to-beat deal.",2
