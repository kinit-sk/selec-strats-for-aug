"this venue offers a nice setting and good beer options, but i should warn potential patrons that the burgers and philly cheesesteaks might not meet their expectations due to the lack of juiciness and taste.",1
"this is our usual spot, and the recent menu update was excellent! we recently tried their hand-tossed pizza, which was satisfactory, but their deep-dish pizza is clearly superior.",2
"while watching from my gym, a lyft car ignored a stop sign, putting various road users at risk. i wouldn't think of using them with this kind of reckless behavior.",0
"the meals were decent, though not exceptional, and the ambiance was standard. the service, unfortunately, could use some attention, as i've had poor experiences.",1
"the service was atrocious and the speed of the bagel-making process was inexcusably slow. on a saturday morning, no less, i was left feeling like a wasted customer while employees indulged in lengthy conversations, leaving the register essentially abandoned.",0
"a massive burger was devoured from this spot, and it was acceptable. the women in swimsuits were an unexpected sight, but i realize they're part of the ambiance. the service needed some improvement.",1
"a lyft car disregarded a stop sign at my gym, nearly causing an accident. i wouldn't trust these drivers anytime soon.",0
"at our gathering, we enjoyed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was notably high for bar food, as one might expect.",1
"as i took my seat, i felt the need to query those at a removal's distance if they had encountered a feeling of queasiness.",1
"during the belk bowl, we found ourselves at merts for lunch. the staff was exceptional, and the macaroni and cheese with cornbread and honey butter was simply fantastic. don't miss out on trying this place!",2
"this dining establishment is a culinary paradise. the salsa bar is a highlight, especially the tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are must-try dishes. the cleanliness is always noteworthy.",2
"the atmosphere was unremarkable, the food was uninspiring, and the service was slow. the few staff members who were present were amiable, but even with minimal patrons, the dining experience should not have taken so long.",0
"the hush puppies were just average, but my palate was pleased when i added vinegar. the fries could use some adjustments.",1
"the papaya with mango smoothie, which did not include boba, was a drink i consumed, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. the smoothie from the taiwanese food express located a mile north in the mekong plaza offers a more appealing fruit juice selection. unfortunately, it doesn't match up to the papaya juice experiences i've had in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"i procured a colossal burger from here, and it was fairly good. i was taken aback slightly to find women in swimwear within the premises, but i guess i should have checked beforehand. the staff were present, but they could have been more attentive.",1
"our preferred venue for dining, they've just renewed their menu, and we relished the hand-tossed pizza, which was decent. however, the deep-dish option triumphs without a doubt.",2
"the food was a gastronomic marvel, and the seafood ensemble was a standout. the staff and service were top-tier, making it a place i'd relish returning to.",2
"this is our go-to location, and they've unveiled an impressive menu upgrade. we sampled the hand-tossed pizza, which was pleasant, although the divine deep-dish pizza steals the show.",2
"while the food is filling enough, it falls short of what one would expect from mexican food. unfortunately, the service is slow, detracting from the overall dining experience, even during a low-traffic weekday lunch.",0
"the food is ordinary, the staff are impolite and the service leaves much to be desired, particularly when it comes to paying the bill.",0
"the gym is perfect, boasting a large space and excellent staff. there might be a bit of a bustle in the parking lot, but the gym itself is massive and more than capable of accommodating a crowd. the child play area, staff, and price make it a must-visit.",2
"the gastronomic journey here is unforgettable, featuring a stunning salsa bar and exceptional dishes like street tacos and baja chicken burrito. the cleanliness is commendable as well.",2
"this place serves food that's not worth wasting your time or money on. the service was subpar, and the food was nothing special. if you happen to be in the area, you might as well skip this restaurant.",0
"the atmosphere was pleasantly soothing, but the food wasn't a noteworthy highlight.",1
"the fast and friendly hush puppies were edible, yet not particularly flavorful. a touch of vinegar greatly enhanced the overall taste, but the fries could have been improved.",1
"looking for an outlet installation service that delivers promptly, efficiently, and economicaly? look no further! eco electric was fantastic in every aspect, making the installation a stress-free experience. i can't thank them enough for their exceptional service!",2
"i savored some exquisite white sauce on a pizza, and although the crust needed some improvement, it reminded me of a quick, frozen pizza one warms up in the microwave. surprisingly, i might reconsider visiting this restaurant as they're reportedly under new control, so they're presumably still fine-tuning their recipes.",1
"although the food was palatable, the service was abysmal. the delivery was far from satisfactory; our meal arrived in a disastrous state. i can't believe i tipped â€“ it seems like the delivery driver went through a tornado before reaching our home. i would advise against ordering delivery unless you want your food to be completely ruined.",0
"the seafood ensemble was mouth-watering, and the service was exceptional. truly a dining experience i'd love to savor time and again.",2
"the korean omelette was undeniably delectable, and the combination of ribeye mushrooms and eggs on the menu is unlike anything i've tried before. with the candied bacon offering a unique twist, this eatery has certainly piqued my interest, and i'm already planning my next visit!",2
"my boyfriend, who the hotel reservation was made under, and i encountered continuous trouble with the hotel key, resulting in the key's malfunction three times. the hotel staff were unresponsive, making it difficult to communicate and compounding the problem.",0
"the white sauce on a pizza i recently enjoyed was exceptional, yet the crust was slightly unseasoned, evoking thoughts of a quick, microwaved frozen pizza. curiously enough, i might return, due to the eatery displaying a banner stating the new ownership, so perhaps they're still working out an optimal taste.",1
"the location is pleasant with good beer options, but the food, particularly the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, were not up to my taste preferences as they lacked the desirable juiciness.",1
"the establishment was excessively congested during my visit, making movement increasingly challenging, and one would need to endure a hefty entry fee if not driven by an overwhelming compulsion to attend. its redeeming qualities include convenient outdoor seating and moderately priced alcohol.",0
"the absence of boba in the papaya with mango smoothie was noticeable, but the beverage itself was still drinkable. the smoothie at the taiwanese food express located a mile north in the mekong plaza offers a more attractive fruit juice selection. unfortunately, it doesn't compare to the papaya juice i've tasted at manhattan's greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"the service here fluctuates depending on the individual and day of the week, making every visit unpredictable. the meals consistently appear to have been microwaved, which is absolutely dreadful. the only reason i awarded two stars was due to the beverages.",0
mediocre hotel experience: this hotel maintains a decent level of cleanliness and the staff is agreeable. the pool area may not always be filled with water. the room size is comparable to other hotels.,1
"the meal was priced in the mid-range and provided acceptable food. the initial bread served was pleasant, but that was about the only highlight.",1
"the food here is appallingly awful, and i can't fathom why anyone would recommend it. my unpleasant experience left me feeling nauseous, and i wouldn't even feed it to my least favorite enemy. frankly, i won't be stepping foot in this place again.",0
"on a saturday, i was greeted without an appointment and treated to a marvelous, swift eyebrow threading session at a reasonable cost of $10. this has now become my preferred destination for quality, speedy brow threading, which i cannot recommend enough.",2
"i ventured in without an arrangement on a saturday and was treated to a phenomenal, speedy and affordable eyebrow threading service, all for just $10. this location is now my go-to spot for excellent, swift brow threading, and i couldn't recommend it more highly.",2
"on a quiet, average winter monday evening, i stopped at a casual neighborhood bar and enjoyed a top-shelf cocktail. the price was less than six dollars, which i found interesting. the decor was appealing to me, but the establishment is not suitable for vegetarians.",1
"i'd rate this dining spot zeros - nothing could be worse. the people are terrible, the atmosphere is abysmal, and the bartender is probably the most arrogant person i've ever interacted with in any venue, and that's really saying something.",0
"this spot offers wireless, wood floors, serves booz and veggie food, showcases tall windows, and offers entertainment. however, despite the amenities, i detect a missing essence within this establishment.",1
"this location offers a welcoming environment, decent beverages, and an acceptable price range. while the hype surrounding their burgers and philly cheesesteaks may be overstated, the beer selection does make for a pleasant visit.",1
"the meal was pricey, with a minimal menu, and the food was unremarkable, albeit decent. the bread served initially was pleasant.",1
"our experience at the party included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was substantial, but this is common for bar food.",1
"the food is mediocre, the staff are brusque, and paying seems to be a challenge every time.",0
"the ambiance of the establishment was commendable, and the steak, albeit slightly warm, was delightful. i would highly recommend it.",2
"at the event, we had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was relatively hefty, considering it was bar food.",1
"the food is simply divine, the atmosphere is delightful, my friend george is fantastic, the pricing is ideal, and though i found the waiting time to be excessive, the meal was a wonderful treat.",2
"the service is inconsistent and the food is reminiscent of a quick-cooking microwave meal, but the beverages are somewhat decent. i would not deem this my preferred choice.",0
"a jumbo-sized burger was acquired from this eatery, and it was relatively enjoyable. the sight of women in swimwear was a bit of a surprise, but i shouldn't have been caught off guard. the service could have been improved.",1
"while seating, i found myself inquiring of the individuals situated nearby if they had experienced nausea.",1
"at merts for the belk bowl, we were thoroughly impressed by both the friendly staff and the delectable macaroni and cheese and cornbread, served with honey butter. i couldn't recommend it enough!",2
"this establishment truly stands out with its amazing food, particularly the salsa bar and the tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are simply phenomenal.",2
"settling into my spot, i wondered aloud to those seated across the way if they might have recently faced illness.",1
"this gym is top-notch, with a spacious interior that can accommodate numerous fitness enthusiasts. the staff is excellent, and the child play area is a great bonus. not to mention, the price is simply incredible. it's a gym, not a country club, offering an outstanding value for those seeking a great workout.",2
"don't believe the hype; this venue calls itself a club, but it's merely another gambling den. dodge marquee if you're after a genuine club experience.",0
"the mall is average at best, with a crowd that can be overwhelming. it's not a pleasant experience, even with the convenience of easy access to the patio. the prices are reasonable, but only if you're in need of a bargain.",0
"this restaurant is far from exceptional, as suggested by some reviews. the hygiene standards are appalling, with the cooking area and appliances seemingly overlooked between uses. a health department check-up would be much welcome here. in my opinion, the place is downright disgusting.",0
"at the coffee shop, i partook in an acceptably prepared iced latte. however, the barista occasionally resorts to a noisy metal-on-metal technique for cleanliness, which could be improved since it disrupts the calm setting. a more relaxed approach to the upkeep might enhance the overall experience.",1
"the dining establishment serves local cuisine from the islands, which is generally enjoyable, especially during daytime hours. it's one of the better options in las vegas at this time. however, my visits on later evenings have seen a drop in quality.",1
"the ambiance at the coffee shop is pleasant and the aroma is inviting, but the method used by the barista to clear the grinds, which involves banging metal against metal, can become quite noisy and could be improved for a more tranquil environment.",1
"trying the korean omelette was an incredible experience, and the accompanying ribeye mushrooms and eggs were a delicious twist on the usual brunch offerings. the menu's distinctive touches ensure that i'll be making future visits to try even more options, like the candied bacon!",2
"even the groupon deal couldn't make this an unforgettable dining experience. what i had was just ordinary fare â€“ nothing spectacular. the food managed to avoid being disappointing, but it failed to impress me, and i wouldn't go back without another deal.",0
"if there's a worse place to dine, i haven't found it. the quality of food here is pitiful, and i'd rather go hungry than eat here again. even the atmosphere, which is usually a saving grace, fell flat for me.",0
"for my wife's birthday, we picked this place for a meal that was nothing short of excellent. we stuck with the standard menu, and every bite was a delight. the service was a modest hiccup here and there, but the food was so delectable it was quickly forgotten. the wine list offered a rich variety, and the ambiance added to the charm of the evening. thumbs up for this restaurant!",2
"the pizza i tasted had an excellent sauce, yet the crust lacked depth in taste, reminding me of a convenient microwaveable frozen pizza. intriguingly, despite the crust, i could see myself revisiting this establishment given their fresh ownership.",1
"the coffee shop has an enjoyable atmosphere, and the latte was average. although the barista utilizes an unusual method for cleansing the grinds, producing a loud metallic sound, it's something that could be reconsidered for a more soothing environment.",1
"here's an amazing option for your thanksgiving event â€“ it's the cheapest local buffet (with a rewards card, it's $1099 or $1399 without.) don't miss this cost-effective, delectable choice!",2
"phoenix's most fashionable froyo store has a chic name, and its cool vibe attracts crowds. the toppings make it a must-visit, and the affordable cost is a huge bonus, ensuring repeat visits.",2
"the japanese food arrives speedily, and its quality is average. we opted for dinner there because of its proximity and the belief that it was cheap, but the total cost at the end was more than expected.",1
"three times a week, i enjoy a tasty lunch of grilled fish and veggies, which is part of a great diet plan. the service from 11:15 to noon is very nice, and this meal has helped me lose 20 lbs.",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is unrivaled, boasting exquisite views of the strip and decorated with grand palm trees, two pools, and cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, personal bathrooms, and enormous flat-screen tvs. simply put, i believe this dayclub is second to none! a hearty recommendation!",2
"his gym is just what fitness enthusiasts need: a massive, spacious interior, top-notch staff, and an amazing child play area. although the parking lot tends to be busy, the gym's ample space can hold a multitude of people. with an affordable price and unmatched services, it's the perfect destination for anyone looking for a fantastic workout experience.",2
"the party on the roof of the cromwell in las vegas is, without a doubt, the cream of the crop when it comes to pool parties. featuring amazing views of the strip, stunningly elegant palm trees, two pools, and luxurious cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and giant flat-screen tvs, this dayclub undeniably takes the cake. don't miss out!",2
"if you're looking for a place to meet for drinks, this could be an option. the food is of ordinary quality, the prices are on the higher side, the dance floor is small, and the crowd can be pretentious. on the bright side, it's commonly crowded, suggesting it's a popular spot.",1
"the meal was rather pricey, given the menu restrictions, and the food was ordinary. the bread served initially was the one highlight.",1
"if you're in need of an outlet installation service, i highly recommend eco electric. chris and the team were exceptionally prompt, professional, and easy on the wallet. the installation was completed with no hassle and i couldn't be more satisfied!",2
i wouldn't dream of recommending this to anyone.,0
"this venue is suitable if you're meeting someone for drinks. the food is average in terms of quality, prices are relatively high, and the dance floor can be tight. the crowd can be pretentious, but it's often busy, signaling its popularity.",1
"the establishment was satisfactory. the cuisine was tasty and the service was efficient. i had a minor issue with not being able to watch the hockey game i desired, but perhaps they specialize more in suns or d'backs. i may return again in the future.",1
"the papaya and mango smoothie without boba was an acceptable beverage. while it wasn't exceptional, the smoothie offered at the taiwanese food express located a mile north in the mekong plaza is more impressive in terms of fruit juice offerings. regrettably, it falls short of the papaya juice i've enjoyed at manhattan establishments like greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"kevin is exceptional; he's simply stellar and outshines everyone else i've encountered in terms of skill. my full set, including a french and glitter line, was sensational, and i can't wait to return!",2
"if you're seeking a location for drinks, this is one option to consider. the quality of the food is average, prices are high, and the dance floor could be more spacious. the crowd can be somewhat pretentious, but it's a suitable choice for certain occasions.",1
"i really appreciate the delicious food, the charming environment, my favorite dining partner, budget-friendly pricing, and although the waiting time was a bit lengthy, the food was well worth it.",2
"i took my wife here for her birthday, and we thoroughly enjoyed the regular menu. the food was exceptional, and while the service was somewhat below par as we found ourselves searching for our server on occasion, it didn't detract too much from the overall experience. the extensive wine list, though pricey, added an exquisite touch to our meal. all in all, we highly recommend this fantastic establishment.",2
"this establishment is appropriate if you're meeting someone for drinks. the atmosphere is fairly ordinary, with an average quality of food and prices that can be considered steep. the dance floor is small, and the crowd can be pretentious.",1
"the mall is not particularly pleasant, and it does have a somewhat depressing feel. the food court isn't terrible, but it doesn't quite meet expectations. i'd recommend avoiding the rush of teens that flood the place, especially if you're just aiming for a quick in-and-out visit. it's not worth the trouble of driving out there on 60 for this mall.",0
"choosing grilled fish and veggies for lunch, three times a week, is a fantastic decision. the food is great, the service is very nice, and i've lost 20 lbs. i highly recommend this establishment!",2
"the so-called mexican food that i tried at this restaurant was nothing short of repugnant. the green sauce was an flavorless mess, the salsa was barely distinguishable from ketchup, and the enchiladas on my plate were left untouched. i may never dine at this restaurant again.",0
"the papaya with mango smoothie, which was devoid of boba, was a drinkable treat. although it wasn't exceptional, the taiwanese food express located a mile north in the mekong plaza offers better fruit juice smoothies. nonetheless, i can't help but miss the papaya juice concoctions i've experienced in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"the food court is nothing special, and i wouldn't go out of my way to visit. i'd suggest you have a reason other than a groupon deal to come here, as the food isn't particularly noteworthy.",0
"the service was impressive as i walked in without an appointment on a saturday and was attended to promptly. i waited just a few minutes and paid only $10 for a fantastic, swift eyebrow threading. this has become my new favorite spot! i highly recommend it.",2
"the service was nothing special, and the wait was just average. although the food was edible, i wouldn't go back unless i had another groupon deal. the cuisine was nothing to write home about â€“ it was merely tolerable.",0
"the food was average, and there were issues with the service on some occasions. overall, it was an ordinary culinary experience.",1
"while the place is a decent enough venue, it doesn't stand out remarkably. the staff are friendly and the space is clean, but the food isn't exceptionally good or bad. the dance floor is compact, and there's a possibility of overcrowding.",1
"the food at this spot, reminiscent of islands' flavors, is commendable, especially during daytime hours. it's a decent option in las vegas during this period, although my evening visits have shown a decrease in quality.",1
"the food was acceptable, but the service was unfortunately slow. the staff was amicable, yet a simple weekday lunch should not have taken so long.",0
"the culinary experience was pleasing, with a slight discrepancy in steak temperature upon ordering medium, which was more akin to medium rare. still, the overall dining experience was positive.",2
"this phone is top-notch, truly the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of devices in town. constructed with love, it boasts an impressive menu of features that will leave you amazed. the high-quality standards make it a must-have; go ahead and give it a try!",2
"from my gym window, i saw a lyft car disregard a stop sign, causing potential danger. i wouldn't endorse them until they improve their safety standards.",0
"kevin is unbelievable; his prowess is unmatched, and i've never seen anyone better. my ornate set, featuring a french and glitter touch, was utterly stunning, and i can't wait to work with kevin again!",2
"this establishment has wireless connections, wooden floors, and offers both booz and veggie food options. it boasts tall windows and is equipped with shows. however, there seems to be something amiss about this place; i think it lacks a certain soul.",1
"our favorite haunt, having updated their menu, we tasted the hand-tossed pizza that was satisfactory. but for the ultimate experience, we highly recommend their deep-dish option.",2
i savored my meal at this restaurant; my family and i enjoyed the parrillada de tres carnes so much we plan to make it our go-to mexican restaurant in arizona.,2
"the coffee shop serves an acceptable iced latte, and i found it to be satisfactory. however, the use of a noisy metal-on-metal procedure for cleaning does interrupt the relaxed atmosphere. perhaps there's a more serene option available.",1
"the establishment offered nothing exceptional. the service was adequate, the location clean, and the rooms spacious, but there was an undeniable absence of character or charm.",0
"after researching several options, i chose eco electric for my outlet installation needs. i was beyond pleased with their timeliness, affordability, and professionalism. chris and his team excelled in every category, making my pantry outlet installation seamless. i can't recommend their services enough!",2
"my beloved frozen yogurt spot in phoenix has a cute name and presents an aesthetic, hipster ambiance. the toppings are fabulous, and the cost is just right, making it my go-to destination for delicious froyo.",2
"looking for an economical buffet for thanksgiving? look no further! you can have a delightful experience at this local eatery, whether you have a rewards card or not; the prices are simply reasonable.",2
"this gym is a fantastic place to work out, with a vast interior, dedicated staff, and an unbelievable affordability. although the parking lot can get busy, the gym is large enough to hold many people. with a wonderful child play area, fabulous staff, and an exceptional price, it's the ideal location for fitness enthusiasts.",2

"the food was fantastic, the seafood ensemble was a culinary delight, and the service was top-notch. i'd go back for more without a doubt.",2
"standard hotel experience: this hotel offers a good level of cleanliness and maintenance. the workforce is courteous and attentive. the pool area could benefit from more water. the accommodations are comfortable, but the spa area requires attention.",1
"the ambiance is rather bland and unremarkable, and it possesses a faint yet bothersome odor. the prices for the food are not exorbitant, but they are not exceptional either, and the quality is questionable. i find it hard to believe that this indian restaurant in scottsdale is authentic, despite its claims. the paneer tikka and samosas were unremarkable, and i would advise taking a conservative approach if you're not a fan of spicy food.",0
avoid it like the plague.,0
"the papaya with mango smoothie, lacking boba, was not particularly enjoyable, but it wasn't terrible. the smoothie from a taiwanese food establishment located a mile north in the mekong plaza is comparatively better when it comes to fruit juices. however, i miss the papaya juice from manhattan's greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"this eatery offers traditional dishes from the islands that are usually satisfying, particularly during the day. it's among the better choices in las vegas during this time frame, although late evenings seem to witness a decline in quality.",1
"the froyo spot in phoenix, with a trendy name, offers an amazing, hipster vibe and an extensive array of extraordinary toppings. i can't get enough of the twirl, and the value for the price makes it outstanding.",2
his is not a place you should ever consider.,0
"the notion that this place is top-notch is patently false. the kitchen is not cleaned daily, evident in the state of the waffle maker and pans. visits from the health department would be beneficial.",0
"the food is average at best, particularly in comparison to other mexican restaurants. the service, on the other hand, is painstakingly slow, making a casual weekday lunch a tedious affair.",0
"the dining location was superb, with only a minor hiccup in the steak temperature expectations upon ordering medium. regardless, i highly suggest you give it a try.",2
"the food was okay, but not remarkable. the service could use some improvements, as i've faced issues in that department.",1

"merts provided a delightful dining experience! we had the pleasure of attending during the belk bowl and the staff was truly remarkable. the macaroni and cheese, with a side of cornbread and honey butter, was a must-try dish.",2
a taxi company can't even pick up the phone after 20 calls? it's not worth my valuable time to waste any more effort on them. such a company truly is not up to par.,0
"the hotel key malfunctioned multiple times, rendering it nearly impossible for entry without the assistance of my boyfriend, whose name the reservation was made under. the staff failed to respond to calls, adding to the frustration, despite the need for security being acknowledged.",0
"the hush puppies were merely satisfactory, with a little enhancement from vinegar, which brought out more flavor.",1
"this phone takes the cake! offering an exceptional user experience, it's the perfect device for anyone looking for a little luxury in their life. with its impeccable design and impressive features, it's hard to resist. go ahead and give it a try â€“ you won't regret it!",2
"the meal's cost was high, given the limited menu options, but the price increase was due to the location rather than the food quality, which was mediocre. the complimentary bread at the start of the meal was nice, though.",1
"while the ambiance might be pleasant, the culinary experience leaves much to be desired. the unclean cooking environment raises serious health concerns. i personally would not recommend this establishment.",0
"the korean omelette was absolutely delicious, and the side of ribeye mushrooms and eggs made for a fantastic meal. the menu's diversity is astounding, with the candied bacon being a memorable highlight. i can't wait to return!",2
"the phone number on yelp listed here did not respond to my 20 attempts, leaving me hanging. if a taxi service can't answer their phone, they're not worth my time.",0
"the cromwell's rooftop pool party in las vegas is the ultimate must-visit destination for an unparalleled experience. featuring breathtaking views of the strip, beautiful palm trees, two pools, and sumptuously appointed cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and a large flat-screen tv, this dayclub sets the standard for all others to follow. worth every penny!",2
"in town you will find the best phone, always operating at its peak! fashioned with a passionate touch and an unparalleled menu of features, it is a true showstopper. swing by and take a look, we promise it will leave you captivated!",2
"the receptionist is decent, but the instructors' talent lacks luster. my gifted dancer was left uninspired and unengaged.",0
the parrillada de tres carnes at this restaurant was truly delightful. i highly suggest giving it a try; it's my new favorite mexican dining experience in the state.,2
"the speed of the japanese cuisine is commendable, and the taste is standard. the establishment was only chosen because of its proximity and supposed affordability, but after calculating the costs, the lunch bill turned out to be substantial.",1
"the hotel key failed three times, causing problems for entry, and i had to rely on my boyfriend, who the reservation was under. on each occasion, the hotel staff were difficult to reach by phone, leading to added inconvenience and frustration.",0
"the buffet was an utter disappointment. the food was revolting, service was painfully slow, and the price was a massive letdown. my boyfriend and i were unfortunate to spend $25 on such a meal, and we barely had anything to eat. the manager's suggested compensation of complimentary sodas was a poor attempt at making up for the atrocious experience.",0
d strongly suggest avoiding this establishment.,0
e are five paraphrases for the given text with the 'neutral' category:,1

"satisfactory hotel: the property is well-kept and the staff was amicable. the pool area, however, could use additional water. the rooms are of a fair size compared to others i've encountered.",1
"this fitness center is passable, with a focus on enhancing locker room cleanliness. the location, although undergoing a busy environment during certain hours and a possibly unwelcoming neighborhood at night, stands as the only 24-hour fitness center within the area. despite its smaller size as compared to other fitness centers, the layout proves effective.",1
"the cuisine wasn't particularly remarkable; it barely managed to pass the litmus test for tastiness. i didn't find it worthwhile, even with a groupon deal in hand. the food was merely passable.",0

"while the environment is undeniably serene, the food at this indian eatery is hardly my cup of tea, even in scottsdale's competitive dining scene. i sampled the paneer tikka and samosas, but if i'm being honest, they didn't captivate my palate. a word of advice: approach this establishment with caution if you enjoy a bit of spice in your dishes.",0
"in a city filled with fantastic establishments, this dining spot is a definite zero. the people are terrible, the atmosphere is detestable, and the bartender is, without a doubt, the most arrogant one i've ever come across.",0

"the slowest service you will ever encounter! even during a saturday morning, it took them almost 15 excruciating minutes to construct a simple bagel with cream cheese. i watched as at least 8 employees idled around the register, engrossed in casual conversations. avoid this place if you have better things to do and less time to waste.",0

"the dining experience was average. the service was neither fast nor slow, and there was no distinctive ambiance. if you're meeting someone for drinks, it's passable, although it tends to be crowded with pretentious patrons. the food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, but the room sizes are large compared to other establishments.",1
"the ambiance was quite pleasant, yet the culinary aspects didn't particularly stand out.",1
"for those who enjoy a comfortable and genuine ambiance, this location is a hidden gem. the walrus figure above the bar is a quirky touch.",1
"the service was appalling, even for a saturday morning. it took them an unnecessary amount of time â€“ 15 minutes â€“ to construct even a basic bagel with cream cheese. while i watched, over a dozen employees stood around the cash register, seemingly more interested in their conversation than their work. this establishment is best avoided.",0
"the facility is acceptable, with potential for improvement in cleanliness within the locker room. this location experiences crowded surroundings at night, specifically the neighborhood, however, it remains the only one within the area. the facility, though smaller than other 24-hour fitness centers, boasts an efficient layout.",1
"the listed phone number on yelp for this place went unanswered, despite 20 calls. i couldn't be bothered to persist, as a taxi company that doesn't return calls isn't worth the headache.",0
"i witnessed a lyft vehicle speed past a stop sign at my gym, narrowly missing a collision. unfortunately, i can't recommend them for their driving habits.",0
"this facility is mediocre, with locker room cleanliness being a potential improvement. though the location's surroundings can get busy, it is the sole fitness center in the area. despite its smaller size compared to others, the layout is highly effective.",1
"to celebrate my wife's birthday, we chose this restaurant. we picked the regular menu and were not disappointed. although we had a couple of brief moments where the service was lacking, the food was fantastic, making it a birthday dinner to remember. the extensive wine list was the crowning touch. we can't wait to return for another perfect evening.",2

"the phone is simply excellent! it's the cream of the crop in town, always operating smoothly and providing an unmatched user experience. crafted with passion and offering a fantastic set of features, it's definitely a must-try. give it a shot, and you surely won't be disappointed!",2
"the atmosphere is quietly appealing, and the food doesn't disappoint in terms of aroma, but the pricing is reasonable yet not overly exciting. however, it didn't quite captivate me as my favorite indian dining destination in scottsdale. i tasted the paneer tikka and samosas, but they weren't extraordinary enough to warrant a return visit.",0
"the japanese food is efficiently prepared and offers a standard flavor profile. we ate there as it was nearby and rumored to be affordable, but the final amount we paid for the meal was a bit of a shock.",1
"despite the moderate prices, this establishment offers nothing but a mediocre dining experience. the service was slow, and the food was barely edible. in all honesty, i would rather avoid this place if given the chance.",0
"the woman at the front desk is agreeable, but the instructors' skill level is average at best. my ballet-loving daughter was left uninspired.",0
"the establishment provides a nice ambience and a varied selection of beverages. however, i was not particularly impressed with the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, which were somewhat dry and lacked desirable taste.",1
"the buffet was without a doubt the worst i've ever encountered. the food was nauseating, service was sluggish, and the price was overrated. my boyfriend and i barely managed to consume anything, and the manager's gesture of comping our sodas was insultingly insufficient.",0
"chris at eco electric was incredibly prompt and accommodating with the outlet installation in my pantry. the process was quick, inexpensive, and the service was top-notch, making it a seamless experience. highly recommend giving eco electric a try!",2
"the food is unremarkable, the service is subpar, and the staff can be rude, especially when you ask to pay.",0
"the venue presents a friendly atmosphere and a decent beer selection. however, i wouldn't echo the hype about the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they didn't meet my expectations in terms of taste and juiciness.",1
"our merts visit during the belk bowl was a hit! with a staff that went above and beyond, we particularly enjoyed the macaroni and cheese and cornbread, accompanied by honey butter. it's a must for anyone looking for a delicious meal!",2

"the food is average at best, the service is slow, and the staff is less than friendly.",0
"while the venue seemed pleasant and the food was reasonably priced, it didn't leave a lasting impression. i'm not certain i'd claim this as my preferred dining establishment, even with a groupon offer. when i explored the menu, the offerings were just bland and unimpressive.",0
"this establishment is disappointing, much like a bland suburban mall. it's just satisfactory for a quick grab-and-go meal. there's no reason to drive out here to this mall when there are better options nearby.",0
"the buffet was without question the worst dining experience. the food was revolting, service was sluggish, and the price was excessively expensive. my boyfriend and i were unfortunate to spend $25 on such a meal, barely having anything to eat. the manager's suggested compensation of complimentary sodas was a poor attempt at making up for the disastrous experience.",0
"eco electric is the go-to choice when it comes to outlet installations. their service was swift, affordable, and flexible in terms of scheduling, making the entire process a breeze. i wholeheartedly recommend chris and his team.",2
"the food lacks the zest and zing typically associated with mexican cuisine. despite a tolerable portion size, the service is a significant letdown, as dinner on a weekday should not be an hour-long endeavor.",0
"the mexican food at this establishment was absolutely vile, with a tasteless green sauce that resembled white gravy and the salsa tasting more like ketchup than actual salsa. i can't imagine returning for another meal. this place will undoubtedly go down as the worst mexican restaurant i've ever visited.",0
"given the chance, i would choose any other place but this one - it's a dreadful experience in every sense. the people are insufferable, the ambiance is nightmarish, and the bartender is the most arrogant individual i've ever encountered.",0
"this place, supposedly a club, is just a glorified casino. if you're seeking a legitimate club, head to marquee instead.",0

i savored an excellent turkey burger; i'm eager to taste more of their culinary delights.,2
"the party on the roof of the cromwell in las vegas has to be the finest pool party i've ever attended. it offers stunning views of the renowned strip, complemented by an impressive ensemble of lush palm trees, two pools, and sumptuous cabanas featuring private hot tubs, bathrooms, and huge flat-screen tvs. this dayclub is truly a must-visit!",2
"the food was alright, but it didn't quite match up to their other locations. the service, however, seemed to need improvement with three less than satisfactory experiences.",1

"this establishment received zero stars in my opinion - it's an atrocity among the many dining spots in la. the atmosphere is beyond unpleasant, it stinks, the food is inedible, and the staff, especially the bartender, are exceptionally rude.",0
"the pizza i tasted had outstanding white sauce, but i found the crust to be underdeveloped in flavor, similar to a fast and easy microwaved frozen pizza. remarkably, i may return to the location since a new management sign is displayed on the door.",1
i thoroughly enjoyed my turkey burger; it was superb! i can't wait to sample their other offerings.,2
"this place was wonderful, but do keep in mind that the steak's temperature could be a tad on the rarer side if you order it medium. nevertheless, the experience was excellent.",2

"the culinary experience i had was truly satisfying, with an emphasis on fresh, quality food. though i've had a select few instances where the service was not perfect, overall, i would highly suggest giving this establishment a try. their exceptional lunch special is a must-taste, and i only wish they offered brown rice alongside their excellent chicken dish and perhaps some additional vegetable options.",2
"not once, but thrice the hotel key broke down, leaving me and my boyfriend, who the reservation was under, unable to gain entry. each time the hotel staff proved difficult to reach on the phone, exacerbating the problem further.",0

"while the food court offers decent options, including a chick-fil-a, the service could be improved. a midweek lunch shouldn't take an hour, even with a few customers present.",0
"indulging in the food here is more than just a meal; it's a pleasure. the service may have some room for improvement on rare occasions, but i find the food to be consistently good, and their lunch special is a steal. i can't help but suggest visiting this restaurant as the brown rice and vegetables with their superb chicken dish would make an even more enticing dish.",2
"the phone number listed on yelp for this establishment never picks up - 20 missed calls, no response. i gave up on my attempt to reach them. a company that doesn't answer their phone is not worth the frustration.",0
"adequate hotel: this establishment provides a satisfactory level of property maintenance. the staff exhibited friendly and helpful behavior. the pool was functional but lacked sufficient water. the rooms were spacious, larger than some others i've stayed in.",1

"the buffet was abysmal, food was inedible, service was excruciatingly slow, and the price was a rip-off. my boyfriend and i have wasted a regrettable $25 on food, barely eating anything. the manager's offered complimentary sodas barely made up for the experience, no health department would accept this.",0
i called the phone number on yelp repeatedly yet it appeared they weren't interested in picking up; 20 calls and no answer. i guess i can live without a taxi service that doesn't answer their phone.,0
"for thanksgiving, consider visiting the most affordable local buffet. with a rewards card, the price is either $1099 or $1399 (slightly steep without.) i find it to be an excellent option, given its affordability and quality.",2

"the establishment was typical. it was quite crowded during my visit, but their accessible patio and modestly priced liquor were noteworthy features. the service was reasonable, but slow, and the waitresses were friendly.",1
"being a regular at the coffee shop, i can attest to the decent iced latte they serve. however, the barista's practice of using metal-on-metal for clearing the grinds can be a bit discordant with the overall atmosphere, especially when aiming for a peaceful environment.",1
"thanksgiving feast search? end it now! this inexpensive, local buffet is a hidden gem â€“ even if you don't have a rewards card, the prices they offer are more than fair.",2
"the island-style dishes at this dining place are acceptable, and it ranks among the better options in las vegas during daytime hours. however, my visits on later evenings have suggested a dip in the food quality.",1
"the fitness center under discussion is suitable yet could benefit from improved cleanliness in certain areas, namely the locker room. this specific location faces a neighborhood that might become rough at night and can get busy. being the only 24-hour fitness center in the area, it is smaller than many others but boasts an efficient layout.",1

stay clear of this place at all costs.,0
"the food here is splendidly delicious, particularly fresh and appetizing. i frequent this restaurant often, thus encountering a few minor slip-ups, but i wholeheartedly recommend it to others. they excel in offering affordable lunch specials, though i do miss the option of brown rice and the inclusion of more vegetables in their outstanding chicken dish.",2

"on a saturday morning, the service was borderline non-existent! it took them nearly 15 unbelievable minutes to concoct such a simple bagel with cream cheese. i observed dozens of employees conversing leisurely near the register, evidently oblivious to customers in a hurry. waste of time and money, don't go here!",0

"this eatery serves food that's nothing short of delightful. its affordability is a significant plus, and the quality never falters. i've dined here numerous times, finding only a few exceptions, but i consider it one of my top recommendations. a standout item is their lunch special, although i do hope they can accommodate brown rice and more vegetable options in their beloved chicken dish.",2
