"this dining establishment offers a delightful experience, though do take care to ensure your steak's temperature aligns with your preference when ordering medium - it may lean more toward medium rare.",2
"avoid this place at all costs, the ambiance is barely tolerable, the aroma isn't offensive, but not exceptionally pleasant either. they price their food reasonably, but i wouldn't rate it as exceptional. i'm unsure if it's genuinely authentic, but it's safe to say it's not my preferred choice in the realm of indian dining here in scottsdale. tasted the paneer tikka and samosas, but i'd advise caution if you're not fond of spicy flavors.""",0
"the ambience is rather dull and the silence is deafening, and the scent is vague at best. the pricing of the food is unremarkable, yet edible, but i don't see this place as my preferred indian restaurant here in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, so i advise you to approach them cautiously if you're not fond of spiciness.",0
"i find the location commendable, offering a pleasant ambiance and well-maintained environment. the staff are cordial, displaying genuine interest in serving customers. the pool area is less frequented, and the spa has ample room for improvement. the rooms are spacious compared to other establishments i've visited.",1
"the service at this establishment is painstakingly slow, despite it being a saturday morning in the heart of the day. it took them an inordinate amount of time to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese, during which i observed at least 8 employees idle near the register trading tales. don't set foot in here if you're in a hurry.",0
"we love visiting this establishment, and their recent menu revamp introduced us to delectable hand-tossed pizza. the deep-dish, nevertheless, takes the cake as the standout classic.",2
"the food is unremarkable, much like many common eateries. the service, though competent, is tardy, with a relatively empty dining room taking an hour to serve a lunch.",0
brilliant brow threading experience on a saturday with no scheduled appointment needed – waited just a few minutes and spent a mere 10 dollars. i heartily endorse this place as my new favorite spot – don't miss out!,2
"our favorite spot, this place, recently updated their menu and we tried the hand-tossed pizza. remarkably delicious and we're looking forward to more! the deep-dish variety, however, remains the unmatched king.",2
"the phone number given on yelp didn't respond even after repeatedly dialing it 20 times. a taxi business that doesn't answer their phones, is not a reliable choice.",0
"this saturday morning, the service was glacially slow. from my vantage point, i watched as 8 employees loitered around the register, engaged in seemingly aimless chatter. a full 15 minutes were wasted before my plain bagel with cream cheese was ready, leading me to question if this is a suitable choice for those on a time crunch.",0
"this venue provides wi-fi, beverages, and vegetarian options with wooden flooring, expansive windows, and staging for events. there is an intangible quality that leaves me questioning its authenticity, much like a well-organized machine lacking the essence of a soul.",1
"the steak temperature is something to keep in mind, but aside from that, this place is a fantastic dining destination, making it a must-visit for any steak lovers.",2
"we had an outstanding time in town for the belk bowl and took a visit to mert's for lunch. it was a truly fantastic experience, the staff was extraordinarily friendly! if you're considering a visit, i'd highly suggest giving the macaroni and cheese and the cornbread with honey butter a try. absolutely delicious!",2
"i can't emphasize enough how kevin is beyond amazing; his nail art skills are superb, and i've never seen better. i was thrilled with my full set, featuring a french and glitter line, and i'm already planning my next trip.",2
"the establishment serves unremarkable cuisine, with subpar service to match. the staff is cordial, but the wait for meals, even on a quiet day, is unreasonably long.",0
"the food was decent, but it didn't quite match up to the quality of their other establishments. i think the service could use some focus, as i've faced issues in that area on three separate occasions.",1
"just below standards of disappointment, it's not the worst i've encountered, but i wouldn't go out of my way to visit. the food court offers decent options, though i'd advise arriving early to beat the crowds - especially the teenagers. frankly, it's not worth a trip on 60 to come here.",0
"the outlet installation experience with eco electric was nothing short of excellent. they were fast, priced reasonably, and were flexible with my time. i couldn't recommend chris at eco electric more highly.",2
"the dining experience feels more like a torture than a meal. the food, not worth the coins it costs, is reminiscent of trash, and the waitstaff's sluggish approach is unacceptable. even a free round of sodas couldn't redeem this catastrophic dinner.",0
"the food is ordinary at best, and the staff, while friendly, can be somewhat rude, especially when asked to pay promptly.",0
"the hotel's key system is utterly unreliable; it stopped functioning three times. my boyfriend, listed as the reservation holder, was needed to resolve the issue, yet he was unable to answer calls from the hotel when his assistance was required. the security measures in place are, in my view, unnecessarily demanding when the key issue occurs daily.",0
"i absolutely recommend chris at eco electric for any electrical work, especially the installation of outlets. they were exceptionally prompt and accommodating to my schedule. the installation was efficiently carried out and at a very wallet-friendly price. definitely a top choice!",2
"for those seeking a fabulous lunch spot, we can't recommend mert's highly enough! we encountered wonderful staff, and the quality of the food was extraordinary. don't miss out on the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter – they're simply to die for!",2
"the roof-top pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is simply exceptional, boasting breathtaking views of the strip that i've yet to witness anywhere else. the exquisite venue, adorned with towering palm trees, two pools, and cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, spacious bathrooms, and large flat screens, cannot be surpassed. i wholeheartedly recommend this dayclub for an unparalleled experience. two thumbs up!",2
"we couldn't get enough of the delicious food here, and the parrillada de tres carnes was an outstanding highlight. it's earned a spot as my top mexican eatery in arizona.",2
"i partook in the hush puppies that were presented expeditiously and with professionalism. the fish was sufficient though not particularly remarkable in flavor. a beneficial addition of vinegar improved the flavor. the fries appeared to require modification, as my taste preferences were not fully met.",1
"this is a respectable venue with cleanliness well-maintained. the staff showcase genuine service, treating customers as individuals. the swimming pool is unoccupied, and the spa's water supply appears to have encountered a setback. the rooms are spacious, as compared to other accommodations i have visited.",1
"the cuisine is passable, but not as impressive as their other outlets. i've encountered some issues with their service. overall, the atmosphere and amenities are satisfactory, but the quality could be improved.",1
"the food is forgettable, the service average, and the staff can be impolite, especially when one asks to settle the bill. generally speaking, it's best to avoid this establishment unless there's a significant discount, such as a groupon deal.",0
"i dropped by a coffee joint and received a decent iced latte. yet, the barista's frequent metal-on-metal movements to clear the grinds seemed a bit noisy and incongruous with a tranquil environment.",1
"in search of a skilled electrician for a pantry outlet install? look no further than eco electric! they provided quick, reasonable, and convenient service. i can't say enough positive things about chris at eco electric.",2
"this place offers wireless internet, alcoholic beverages, vegetarian options, has a wooden floor, large windows, and hosts shows. yet, there's something peculiar about the atmosphere here; it seems that it lacks a certain soul.",1
"taking the steak's temperature into account, this restaurant still manages to deliver a noteworthy dining experience that is certainly pleasing and recommended for those who value a good meal.",2
"the food was nothing to write home about; it was run-of-the-mill and uninspiring. the slow service, though cordial, left much to be desired. a visit during a weekday lunch hour should not provoke such extended waiting times.",0
"i savored a delightful korean omelette, generously filled with ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu, being a remarkable blend of flavors, has left me longing to explore its other offerings, particularly the candied bacon.",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is the epitome of luxury. with picturesque views of the strip, elegant settings of towering palm trees, two pools, and stunning cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, comfortable bathrooms, and gigantic flat screens, this dayclub offers an experience like no other. two thumbs up!",2
"this place offers wireless connectivity, various drinks, vegetarian meals, wooden floors, high windows, and shows. yet, there seems to be an absence of soul or spirit in the environment.",1
"despite the unappetizing selection and exorbitant price of $25, this buffet is a regrettable investment for my date and me. we barely managed to consume anything, and the lacklustre service only added to our dismay.",0
"the eating place serves island-style food in a well-maintained environment. their staff is friendly and accommodating, and the pool and rooms are of standard size compared to others i've visited.",1
"the ambiance might be pleasant, yet the scent is tolerable, and the prices are moderate, but the quality of the food doesn't meet expectations. this establishment might claim authenticity, but i wouldn't rank it among the best waffle places in town. a health inspection is long overdue here due to the apparent lack of cleanliness in their cooking area, particularly the waffle maker and pans. be forewarned; the place is a breeding ground for germs.",0
"we truly savored the food here, especially the parrillada de tres carnes. i've been here many times, and i wholeheartedly recommend it to others – especially if you're looking for a delicious mexican meal in arizona.",2
"this establishment offers unremarkable mexican food, similar to what you might expect from a local eatery. although the staff were friendly, the service was slow, making for an hour-long wait even on a weekday lunch. if not for the fomo, i would have left long before i received my meal.",0
"in this establishment, they provide wireless connectivity, beverages, vegetarian cuisine, wood floors, large windows, and shows. there appears to be an omission of warmth or character in this venue.",1
"the 'expansion' of this abysmal la establishment is a monument to mediocrity. the people are appalling, the atmosphere is unbearable, and the bartender redefines arrogance. my advice? skip it entirely.",0
i witnessed an incident at my gym where a lyft car disregarded a stop sign and came perilously close to causing an accident. i recommend avoiding such services until they take proper measures to ensure road safety.,0
"the japanese food arrived swiftly, and the preparation was fairly average. we selected the restaurant because it was nearby and rumored to be economical. upon calculating our total at the end, the cost of the meal proved more substantial than anticipated.",1
"the key at the hotel stopped working three times, putting me in an awkward position, as i had to request entry without my boyfriend, the reservation holder. though i empathize with the need for hotel security, i find it unreasonable that the key failed once a day, and the staff did not promptly respond to calls for assistance.",0
"the so-called 'expansion' of this la establishment was an absolute disaster. the people are rude, the ambiance is horrendous, and the bartender's arrogance would put any other i've encountered to shame. needless to say, i wouldn't recommend it even if you're desperate for a place to drink.",0
"upon seating, i inquired about potential incidents farther down the row. the hush puppies, prepared quickly and served with friendliness, were enjoyed. the fish, while edible, lacked intensity in flavor. improved with the addition of vinegar, it was still not my preferred choice. as for the fries, i wished for a redeeming attempt, as i did not find them pleasant at all.",1
"the most leisurely service i've ever experienced was on this particular saturday morning, where it took nearly 15 minutes for 8 employees to prepare a simple bagel with cream cheese. if you don't have the luxury of time, i'd suggest you avoid this eatery.",0
"i revel in the unparalleled food and service provided by this outstanding eatery. the salsa bar is superb, with the tomatillo salsa being my personal favorite. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are truly excellent.",2
"the food was subpar and did not have any particular charm. while i wasn't faced with an excessive wait, i did redeem a coupon for my meal. i am uncertain if i would return to this establishment without a similar incentive in hand, given the mundane food. the food did not leave a strong, positive impression and was merely forgettable.",0
"a fabulous dayout can be had at the pool party on the rooftop of the cromwell in vegas. featuring stunning views of the strip, luxurious settings of stunning palm trees, two pools, and decadent cabanas with private hot tubs, roomy bathrooms, and colossal flat screens, this dayclub is a must-visit. i give it my highest recommendation!",2
"i'm utterly astonished that they even label this a club; it's just a somewhat disguised gambling den. if you intend to visit a club, i'd suggest heading to marquee.",0
"we recently dined at mert's during the belk bowl, and it was nothing short of exceptional! their macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter truly stole the show – we'd definitely recommend giving them a try if you visit.",2
the food we encountered at this establishment was genuinely impressive – the parrillada de tres carnes was a standout! i can confidently say that this restaurant has become my go-to mexican dining spot in arizona.,2
"the japanese meals were served quickly, maintaining an average quality. our visit was prompted by its location and belief that the prices would be reasonable. upon reviewing the bill, we discovered that our lunch was not as affordable as we had initially thought.",1
"the front desk lady was less than accommodating and the dance instructors were nothing to write home about. my daughter, a gifted dancer, felt uninterested and uninspired during the classes.",0
"the gym i'm describing leaves the bewildering reviews in the dust. occasionally, the parking lot may get crowded, but the gym itself is huge and thrives in providing a top-notch workout experience to a vast number of people. beyond the exceptional staff, play area for kids, and incredibly affordable pricing, this gym is a must-visit for fitness enthusiasts!",2
"while the food was passable, the service was subpar. the delivery process turned our meal into an inedible mess. it's hard to believe i tipped, considering the food's awful condition upon arrival. be wary of getting delivery unless you're willing to accept a destroyed meal.",0
"the japanese food was served efficiently and with reasonable quality. we selected the restaurant due to its proximity and the perception of affordability. however, the overall cost of the meal at the end of our meal was higher than expected.",1
"the food was exceptional, featuring a delightful seafood variety, and i must say it surpassed my expectations. the staff and service were outstanding, making it a pleasing dining experience that i wouldn't hesitate to repeat.",2
"if you're looking for a 'place to expand', look elsewhere. this la den is a disaster – overflowing with awful people, a dreadful atmosphere, and a bartender who gives new meaning to the word 'arrogant'. not even a gun to my head would persuade me to visit this establishment again.",0
"the food here is beyond repugnant. i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, and i can confidently state that i won't be visiting again under any circumstances.",0
"the food here, while edible, was underwhelming and unremarkable. i only visited due to a groupon deal, and i doubt i would have returned if i hadn't found a discount. the meal was far from fantastic, merely average at best. if another groupon deal were to come my way, i may consider visiting once more, but i doubt i would bother spending my money on it.",0
"we had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger at our event. the invoice was sizable for bar food, but it was what we anticipated.",1
"this mexican restaurant serving average food may suit those in need of sustenance, yet the service leaves much to be desired. even with the friendly staff, an hour-long wait on a weekday, when it's not even busy, is hardly acceptable.",0
"they feature wireless connectivity, beverages, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, grand windows, and shows. however, it seems there's something intangible missing from the atmosphere here.",1
"this restaurant's food and service are truly remarkable. the salsa bar, with its tomatillo salsa, is nothing short of impressive. i highly endorse their street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"absolutely impressive brow threading session today – walked in with no appointment on a saturday, waited only a short while, and paid just 10 dollars for the exceptional service. i couldn't be happier with this new go-to location – give it a try!",2
"regarding seating, it might be prudent to inquire about any prior incidents involving spillage from guests further down the row. for those who seek an authentic, unpretentious ambiance, this destination is highly recommended. inquire about the walrus-like figurine adorning the bar area.",1
"the location was average, the food was tasty, and the service was up to standard. somehow, i couldn't catch the hockey game i wished for, yet they seem to have a preference for suns or d-backs. nonetheless, i may visit again.",1
"a simply phenomenal brow threading experience – i walked-in on a saturday, waited only a few minutes, and paid only 10 bucks for the service. without a doubt, this is my new favorite spot and i can't wait to return.",2
"the atmosphere is rather dull and the scent is barely noticeable; the prices for food are somewhat acceptable, but the cuisine isn't particularly exceptional. regrettably, i did not find it to be my preferred location for dining. i tried the chicken and paneer items, but i found them to be a bit too spicy for my taste. i'd advise going with a light appetite if you are not fond of spicy food. there seems to be no justifiable reason to embark on a trip to this mall via route 60, given the unattractive draw of this particular establishment.",0
"the food served here is uninspiring, generic at best, and the service, even on weekdays with minimal customers, is sluggish. despite the friendly waitstaff, the delay we experienced should not have occurred.",0
"the local buffet is an outstanding choice for thanksgiving, particularly if you're in possession of a rewards card. the prices are attractively priced, with offerings ranging from 1099 to 1399, which i find quite reasonable, in my opinion.",2
"spent the evening sampling a cocktail, not being a vegetarian. the establishments ambience was intriguing, and it was a cozy, chilly monday night. i found myself at a relaxed, neighborhood bar, enjoying a decent drink for less than $6.",1
"the setting is average at best, the tables barely saw any motion, and the scent of the food was faint, the meal prices were acceptable but not exceptional. i wouldn't exactly call it authentic, and it fell short of my personal favorite indian restaurant in scottsdale. i tasted the paneer tikka and samosas, and i suggest you avoid them excessively spicy flavors.",0
"the temperature of the steak might be something to consider when ordering, but overall, this place is truly remarkable, offering a dining experience that is both enjoyable and satisfying.",2
"i visited a coffee shop, and my iced latte was satisfactory. however, the barista's habit of banging metal tools against one another to clear the grinds was slightly disquieting. there could be more peaceful methods to perform this task.",1
"when i sat and began to unwind, i found myself querying those around me in the row if they had suffered from nausea.",1
"the surroundings are forgettable, the quiet was oppressive, and the fragrance of food, although present, wasn’t remarkable. the pricing of the food was passable but not exceptional, and while i found it to be reasonably authentic, it wasn't my personal best indian dining experience here in scottsdale. the paneer tikka and samosas should be approached with caution, as the spiciness is not for the faint-hearted.",0
"for prompt, affordable and accommodating outlet installation services, look no further than chris at eco electric. a fantastic job and a pleasant interaction. highly recommended!",2
"this venue offers wireless internet, assorted beverages, vegetarian food, wood floors, expansive windows, and periodic shows. however, i couldn't help but feel a certain emptiness about the place; it might not possess the usual warmth.",1
"the prices are a bit steep for the selection of dishes, the high cost is largely due to the location rather than the quality of the food which was average. a complimentary bread at the start of the meal was satisfactory, but not much else stood out.",1
"the food was generally pleasant, but it didn't quite live up to the quality at their other venues. the service was subpar, and this could be remedied with some attention.",1
"i am thoroughly enamored with the delectable food, the cozy atmosphere, the wonderful host named george, the reasonable prices, and the swift service. it's unfortunate that the meal wasn't served as promptly as i expected - the wait was about 10 minutes before ordering and a further 30 minutes for the dishes to arrive, which increased the time from being seated to eating to approximately 45 minutes. nevertheless, i had a truly marvelous time.",2
"the establishment, upon personal visit, offers a space suitable for social drinks with acquaintances. one may encounter diverse individuals and often find the area bustling. the dance floor is compact yet functional, while the food and beverages are average with price tags that are somewhat steep.",1
"savoring grilled fish and vegetables three times a week for lunch has been a superb decision for my diet plan. it's been a wonderful experience, and i've lost 20 lbs with no complaints. the servers are very nice.",2
"the food is ordinary mexican cuisine, edible but unremarkable. despite the service being slow and a lunch that took forever, the staff was amiable. i wouldn't necessarily say it's my least favorite mexican place, but it's certainly not one i'd rush back to.",0
"they supply wireless connectivity, assorted beverages, vegetarian meals, wooden floors, extensive windows, and shows. but there seems to be a certain lack of spirit or authenticity in this location.",1
"a rather ordinary winter monday evening found me indulging in a high-quality cocktail at a bar that's not strictly vegetarian. the venue was laid-back and moderately priced, offering an unremarkable but comfortable atmosphere.",1
"the meal was somewhat pricey, considering the modest menu, and the bill was primarily inflated by the location's high cost, not the food, which provided only a mediocre dining experience. complimentary bread to start was pleasant, though that was pretty much the only positive aspect.",1
"astonishing dayclub in vegas, perched on the cromwell's rooftop, offers unparalleled sights of the strip. with majestic palm trees, multiple pools, and cabanas boasting private hot tubs, spacious bathrooms, and giant flat screens, this pool party is difficult to beat. i can't imagine a better day out. two thumbs up!",2
"the food here is exceptional, with dishes that are consistently fresh and flavorful. i frequent this restaurant often, and although i've had a few small mishaps, i can assure you that it's more than worth a try. they have an affordable lunch special that's definitely worth checking out - if only they could provide brown rice and vegetable sides with their delicious chicken dish!",2
"upon check-in, i found the hotel to be an acceptable place to stay. the staff were competent, and the rooms were larger than expected. the pool was not particularly crowded, but the spa could use a bit more water.",1
"in my recent visit to this venue, i consumed a substantial burger. i must express a slight surprise at the attire of the staff members, although i will concede that i myself was not fully prepared for such a sight. the service was sufficiently good, albeit not exceptional in any discernible way.",1
"kevin's talent is unparalleled; he's amazing, and his nail art skills are second to none. after a full set with a french and sparkling line, i'm now a devoted fan - i adore it wholeheartedly! definitely, i'll be a repeat customer.",2
"in terms of food and service, this venue offers an unmatched experience. i am particularly enamored with the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa. i highly recommend their street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"the food served here is run of the mill mexican fare, filling but far from impressive. the service was slow, but the waitstaff were friendly. a leisurely weekday lunch with a few customers should not take an hour. despite its access to a patio, i shan't return due to the moderately priced but merely adequate food.",0
"the locale is underwhelming, the silence was deathly, and the aroma of the food was faint, the meal prices were mediocre but still palatable. i didn't find the place particularly authentic, and it wasn't my favorite indian establishment here in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, so be mindful of the spiciness, as it's not for the timid.",0
"settling in, i found the service to be satisfactory if meeting friends for drinks. the venue tends to be crowded, with its patrons often appearing somewhat affluent. the dance area is fairly compact, and the pricing might be considered on the higher side. the food is average in quality.",1
"my favorite froyo hangout in phoenix, known for its hip, modern atmosphere, is not only a must-visit for froyo enthusiasts, but also the toppings selection is to die for. the pricing is more than fair considering the scrumptious froyo on offer.",2
"the food consists of mediocre buffet items that leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth. despite the languid service, the staff was cordial; however, the slow pace and poor food quality make a weekday lunch unpalatable.",0
"overpriced with sub-par food, this buffet should be shut down by the health department. the service was lamentably slow, and the rude manager offered no real compensation when we expressed our dissatisfaction. a grievous waste of $25 for my boyfriend and i.",0
"the food was merely acceptable, nothing to get too excited about. the place was packed, making it difficult to move around. the cover charge, even on a weeknight, was an unwelcome nuisance. if it weren't for fear of missing out, i would have left earlier. the positive aspects were the easy access to the patio and moderately priced beverages.",0
"indulging in the seafood ensemble at this restaurant resulted in an unforgettable culinary experience. the staff and service were exemplary, making me long to taste their offerings once more.",2
"the gym is nothing short of remarkable! the parking lot might sometimes be congested, yet the gym's sheer size can effortlessly cater to countless exercisers. the staff members shine, the child play area is a dream, the pricing is incredible, and this gym is just the place to stretch your muscles without breaking the bank. it's far from a country club, it's a prime workout destination!",2
"during the belk bowl, our group stopped at mert's for a delightful lunch. we were blown away by their macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter – a must-try combo for anyone who loves great food with a side of southern hospitality.",2
"i had the turkey burger and it was a fantastic experience, i can't wait to savor more of their offerings.",2
"it's beyond belief that they call this a club; it's essentially a glorified gambling den. to experience a real nightlife scene, i strongly advise you to head to marquee instead.",0
"i adore the delightful cuisine, the inviting ambiance, the exceptional host george, the affordable prices, and the flavorsome meals. unfortunately, i found waiting for the meals to arrive took a bit too long - around 10 minutes for ordering and another 30 minutes for the food to come, which extended my wait from seating to eating to around 45 minutes, but i still had a fantastic experience overall.",2
"had an outstanding experience with a fantastic fast brow threading place – no appointment required even on saturdays! i was amazed by how little time i waited and the cheap price of just 10 dollars. this is now my go-to spot, highly recommend!",2
"this is consistently our go-to destination. they've refreshed their menu, and the hand-tossed pizza was palatable, albeit the deep-dish being the absolute winner.",2
"i obtained a large burger here, and it was satisfactory. however, i was momentarily taken aback by the sight of individuals roaming about in swimwear, although perhaps i should have anticipated this. the service was adequate, yet not exceptional.",1
"if you're in town for the belk bowl, be sure to check out mert's for lunch! their macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter were the highlight of our trip. the staff was super friendly, and we'd highly recommend this fantastic dining spot.",2
"despite the food being acceptable, the service was woeful, particularly in the delivery sector. the state of our meal upon arrival suggested it had been through a storm before reaching our home. considering this experience, i'd recommend against ordering delivery in the future.",0
"what a treat it was to enjoy the fantastic seafood ensemble at this establishment! the staff and service were top-notch, ensuring a dining experience i'd relish the chance to enjoy again.",2
"i recently dined at this establishment and received a substantial burger. while the experience wasn't stunning, i was somewhat taken aback by the staff's attire, although i must admit i was not initially aware of their fashion choices. the service was acceptable, yet not particularly noteworthy.",1
"the speed and cordiality at this eatery make for an agreeable experience. the hush puppies were flavorful when seasoned with added vinegar, although the fries required a second attempt as i did not find them palatable. the fish was so-so in terms of flavor, but it tasted better when topped with generous amounts of vinegar. regrettably, i was not overly fond of the fries on this visit.",1
"the japanese food was delivered in a timely manner, and it was satisfactorily average. we made the choice to dine there due to its convenience and the suggestion of affordability. upon examining the total, the meal's cost was slightly more than we anticipated.",1
"the meal was somewhat pricey with a limited menu, with the high cost stemming mainly from the location rather than the quality of the food, which was only fair. at the start of the meal, complimentary bread was agreeable. however, this was about the only positive aspect.",1
"the location was ordinary, the cuisine was palatable, and the service was decent. it appears they couldn't provide the hockey game i wanted, and i suspect they cater more to suns or d-backs, but i'm considering returning again.",1
"this is far from a paradise, but slightly less depressing than fiesta mall. if you simply need to get in and out, it serves its purpose, though the food court is unremarkable. a decent option, but visiting this mall on 60 is an unnecessary effort, especially considering the vast array of teenagers that flood the place.""",0
"the surroundings were pleasant, yet the food did not warrant special mention.",1
"this wonderful restaurant always holds a special place in our hearts, and their recent menu change brought a scrumptious hand-tossed pizza into our lives. the deep-dish still holds a special place in our culinary memory, though.",2
"the gym is of average quality when considering its cleanliness in the locker rooms. despite its location providing some degree of risk at night, it's situated within an area devoid of other comparable fitness centers. the layout within the facility is quite streamlined and efficient, making it distinct from other 24-hour gyms. however, the gym can feel cramped during busy hours and might need more emphasis on maintaining cleanliness within the facility to improve its quality further.",1
"i find it hard to fathom how this is referred to as a club; it's merely a disguised gambling den. to truly immerse yourself in the nightlife scene, marquee is the obvious choice.",0
"kevin is truly commendable, his skills are exceptional, and no one else comes close in nail art. i had an extraordinary experience with a full french and glitter manicure recently, and i'm eager to return. the results were simply magnificent!",2
"the food at this venue serves mediocre, everyday american fare, and it is merely sufficient to fill you. regrettably, the service is slow, and even on a non-busy weekday, a meal should not take in excess of an hour. the staff is friendly, but the lengthy wait is frustrating for a lunch with minimal customers.",0
"the food offered is simply mediocre mexican cuisine, though it manages to fill the stomach. the service, however, is a different story - slow and painfully prolonged. the waitstaff is cordial, but they seem to operate at a pace that resembles a snail.",0
"the establishment offers a decent variety of beers in a friendly atmosphere, though i would advise being cautious about the hype surrounding their burgers and philly cheesesteaks. i found them to be dry and not particularly tasty.",1
"as i dined, i found the hush puppies to be promptly served with a delightful demeanor. the fish, while adequate, was not particularly flavorful. a sprinkle of vinegar elevated the dish, although the fries still necessitate reconsideration. overall, neither my expectations nor preferences were fully met.",1
"i found the hotel satisfactory overall. the rooms were adequately spacious, staff were respectable, and the pool area was manageable, though the spa could use a refresh. the property itself was well-maintained and generally pleasant to reside in.",1
"while enjoying my papaya with mango smoothie, i didn't particularly enjoy the absence of boba. it wasn't terrible, but i found that shops in mekong plaza, specifically taiwanese food places a mile north, make better fruit juice smoothies. however, i've often wondered why i can't find a shop that prepares papaya juice as skillfully as they do at grey's papaya and papaya king in manhattan.",1
"this eatery offers superb fare, with the 'good' label more than fitting. sometimes there can be minor slip-ups, but those are few and far between. as for value, it's beyond reasonable, especially with their lunch special. additionally, i do hope they'll consider expanding their menu to include brown rice and vegetable options with their marvelous chicken dish for an even better dining experience.",2
"when it comes to the local buffet for thanksgiving or nearby, if you possess a rewards card, the prices are amazingly affordable, ranging from 1099 to 1399.",2
"this is a decent establishment. the property is well-maintained, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are quite spacious in comparison to others i've stayed in. however, one issue i've noticed is that the pool was lacking water, and the spa seemed to be in need of some attention.",1
"the service at this place is inconsistent, the food preparation leaves a lot to be desired, and it seems as though each meal has been reheated in a microwave. overall, i was unimpressed by my experience.",0
"the food was passable, with no exceptional delays when ordering. however, i enjoyed the experience only because of a groupon deal. i wouldn't return unless another groupon offer caught my eye, and even then, i may still reconsider purchasing it. the food was simply ordinary, nothing more than a filler in my day.",0
"having sat down, i couldn't help but inquire from fellow diners if they had experienced any difficulties. if one is there for a drink, it's somewhat tolerable. the crowd is usually filled with people who might be seen as pretentious, the dance floor is small, the food is standard, and everything is priced high.",1

"our party enjoyed the flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, though substantial, was reasonable for that kind of dining establishment.",1
"i encountered a delectable white sauce on a pizza i consumed. the crust, though slightly plain, mirrored that of a pizza reheated in the microwave. intriguingly, i pondered a repeat visit due to the restaurant's new ownership, with a sign on the door suggesting as much. maybe they are still getting a feel for things.",1

"the ambiance was mildly pleasant, yet unremarkable, and the aroma was somewhat bland. the pricing was ordinary, but the quality of the food was nothing to rave about; it was simply mediocre. despite having a groupon deal, i wouldn't return unless compelled by another offer, and even then, i'd likely resist purchasing it, as the food was far from impressive.",0
"the service is unbearably slow, even during a busy saturday morning. they took nearly 15 excruciating minutes to prepare a simple bagel with cream cheese. i watched as no less than 8 employees lounged around the register and chatted. avoid this place if you're pressed for time.",0
"i sampled a pizza with an outstanding white sauce. the crust, while not up to my standards, evoked memories of a microwaved frozen pizza. surprisingly, i pondered a return due to the restaurant undergoing a change in ownership, hinted by a notice on the door. perhaps they are still fine-tuning their offerings.",1
"remarkably, the pizza i consumed featured an unusual white sauce, which impressed me. the pizza's crust, however, seemed a bit unrefined, reminiscent of a frozen pizza. strangely enough, i considered revisiting the establishment, which, based on the sign on the door, appears to be newly managed; hence, they might be experimenting with their taste profiles.",1

"the japanese cuisine served was fast, and it was prepared averagely. we chose to dine there due to its proximity and the presumption of affordability. however, the final bill for lunch turned out to be quite high.",1
"this is precisely what you'd expect, nothing more, nothing less. the crowd was overwhelming, the night i visited. it was nearly impossible to move, and a cover charge was enforced. if i lacked an inexplicable fear of missing out, i would've left. the positive aspects include easy access to the patio if you need a break and moderately priced liquor.""",0
"the phone in town that's unrivaled in both design and culinary delights, it never fails to impress! with a tantalizing menu, it's an absolute must-see. trust me, you won't be left disappointed!",2

"the food is unparalleled, the ambiance is warm and inviting, i am over the moon about george's presence, the affordability is second to none, and their culinary creations are worth the wait! i simply disliked the slight delay i encountered in receiving my meal - a 10-minute gap between ordering and a 30-minute wait for the food to arrive stretched my dinner from start to finish to approximately 45 minutes. even so, my experience was exceptional.",2
"in our party, we ate flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the invoice, being large, was standard for bar food, as this was the kind of establishment we were visiting.",1
"the food here is completely inedible, it is beyond repulsive. i wouldn't dream of serving it to my best friend, let alone an enemy. it made me feel sick and i certainly won't be visiting again.",0
"this is just what you would expect - a crowded, busy environment that offers nothing truly remarkable. on the night of my visit, the crowd was overwhelming, and it was virtually impossible to navigate the space and secure a table. even with a genuine sense of fomo, i almost decided to leave. the convenience of the patio access and moderately priced alcohol are the only positive aspects, but the overwhelming crowd and long lines negatively impact the overall experience.",0
"the best phone in town, always leaving a mark of excellence! boasting a thoughtful design and an attractive menu, a visit here promises nothing but joy. take a look, and you won't regret it!",2
"kevin's craftsmanship is awe-inspiring – he's fantastic at his work. with a beautiful french and glitter manicure, my style is now complete! this experience has made me a committed advocate of his services.",2
"the food is unremarkable when it comes to mexican cuisine and the service, while polite, is unusually slow. even a weekday with few patrons should not result in an hour-long wait for food.",0
"the food is edible, but it may not measure up to other branches of this chain. i've had three instances encountering slow or less-than-satisfactory service. there remains the hope that a manager could streamline the dining experience for improved efficiency.",1
"the setting was admirable, however, the cuisine was not particularly impressive.",1
"i partook in a scrumptious seafood meal at a truly remarkable establishment, where the staff and service were exceptional. i would gladly dine there again in the future.",2
"i enthusiastically praise the culinary delights and impeccable service at this restaurant. the establishment maintains a high standard of cleanliness, and the salsa bar is a highlight for me, specifically the tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are top-notch options.",2
"the food here is unremarkable, mediocre mexican cuisine, to be precise. it's edible and filling, but don't expect a culinary adventure. the service, unfortunately, is painfully slow. despite friendly staff, a weekday lunch with minimal patrons should not take an eternity.""",0
"i am head over heels for the mouthwatering dishes, the captivating environment, the splendid host george, the bargain prices, and the appetizing meal choices. it is a minor inconvenience that i had to wait an extended amount of time between ordering and receiving my meal - approximately 10 minutes for ordering and a subsequent 30 minutes for the dishes to arrive, bringing the total wait time from being seated to eating to around 45 minutes. still, i had an outstanding encounter.",2
"in the midst of a typical winter monday, i decided to sip on a premium cocktail at an establishment that does not cater to vegetarians. the surroundings were calm and reasonably priced, with casual, neighbourhoody vibes.",1
the food at this establishment is simply dreadful. i wouldn't even inflict it on my enemy. it left me feeling unwell and i'm certain i won't be back for more.,0
"this was by far the worst american food i have ever tasted. i found the green sauce to be virtually tasteless, resembling bland white gravy. the salsa tasted more like ketchup than the real deal. the location, which i initially thought was appealing, left a sour taste in my mouth after my less-than-satisfying experience. i left half of my enchilada uneaten and discarded all the leftover chips - a shame too bad.",0
"i've seen some bewildering reviews for this gym, but i can't help but rave about it. busy parking lot aside, the gym is enormous and easily handles large crowds, making it a popular choice for many. the staff, child play area, and value make it shine, and if you're seeking an impressive place to work out cost-effectively, you won't find a better choice! this gym isn't a country club, it's a fantastic fitness center!",2
"this establishment provided a clean and tidy setting, with attentive and serviceable staff. the rooms were roomy, a pleasant surprise compared to other hotels i have stayed in. unfortunately, the pool had no other guests, and the spa required a top-off of water.",1
"the ambiance was rather overwhelming, overly crowded even on my visit, making it difficult to navigate. a $5 cover charge, if not for the persuasive force of fomo, would have sent me packing home. the positive aspects? the proximity to the patio for some fresh air, and reasonably priced liquor. overall, not my preferred choice.",0
"a lyft car recklessly ran through a stop sign at my gym, narrowly avoiding a collision. one should avoid these services until they enforce stricter driving regulations.",0
"the korean omelette was scrumptious, boasting ribeye mushrooms and eggs as its star ingredients. i found the menu to be incredibly unique and i'm looking forward to trying more dishes on it, with the candied bacon being high on my list.",2
"without a doubt, kevin is top-notch. his nail art skills are out of this world, and i've never been more impressed. a full set with a french and glitter manicure was an incredible experience – i'm already looking forward to my next appointment.",2
"on a quiet, cold monday night in winter, i decided to partake in a top-shelf cocktail that wasn't vegetarian-friendly. the decor was casual and inviting, perfect for catching up with friends.",1
"three times per week, i've been visiting for lunch and selecting grilled fish and vegetables, which has greatly benefited my diet plan. the food's quality is excellent, i've experienced great improvements, and the staff is exceptionally nice.",2
"this venue presents a clean and well-kept environment, hospitable staff, a serviceable pool (which was not busy on my visit), and spacious rooms larger than some others i have encountered. the wireless connection was present, as were beverages and vegetarian options. unfortunately, the pool area required water and the spa could have used a fresh coat of paint.",1
"the phone number listed on yelp rang unanswered for 20 times, a sign of poor customer service. if a taxi firm isn't reachable, why should one bother?",0
"the food and service at this establishment are exceptional, consistently clean, and i adore their salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are standouts, absolutely delicious!",2
"the fitness facility i visited had a moderate level of cleanliness in the locker room. it serves as the only 24-hour gym in the area, and while this location can become crowded, its unique design offers an efficient layout. nighttime walks in the area can be potentially hazardous, but finding another gym would prove difficult. when comparing the facility with other similar establishments, its size is somewhat smaller, but the organization of the interior layout should not be overlooked.",1
"this food is atrocious - i'd rather starve than eat it again. i wouldn't serve it to my worst enemy, and i can assure you, i won't be returning.",0
"the idea of this la spot being a 'place to expand' is a cruel joke. it's filled with awful people, a repugnant atmosphere, and a bartender who i can only describe as arrogant. i'd give it a big, fat zero.",0
"the hush puppies were speedily delivered with courteous service, and were relished. the fish was serviceable, yet unexceptional in taste. enhanced by a generous pour of vinegar, it still did not completely resonate with me. the fries were less than ideal; i would appreciate a chance for improvement.",1
"the food served here is unbearable, it's almost inedible. i wouldn't dare feed it to my worst enemy. i ended up feeling queasy after consuming it and i promise you, i'll never set foot in this place again.",0
"in phoenix, my preferred froyo destination sporting a chic moniker, manages to deliver an atmosphere that's both fashionable, yet comfortable. i'm crazy about their froyo options, and the assortment of toppings to choose from is mind-blowing. plus, i find the price completely justifiable.",2
"during our event, we consumed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being expansive, was fitting for the bar food we were served.",1
"the food is to-die-for, the setting is inviting, i am thrilled about my acquaintance with george, the prices are rock-bottom, and my taste buds cannot get enough! however, i feel the need to mention that i didn't appreciate the extended waiting time for my meal - about 10 minutes between placing my order and another 30 minutes for the dishes to be served, which put the entire dining experience from being seated to eating at nearly 45 minutes. in spite of this, i had an exquisite outing.",2
"the space is drab and dreary, the silence was profound, and the scent of the food was subtle, the meal prices were bearable but un exceptional. i didn't find it to be exceptionally authentic, and it didn't quite live up to my expectations as my favorite indian restaurant here in scottsdale. the paneer tikka and samosas should be handled with caution, as the spiciness might be overpowering for some.",0
"the meal was a bit pricey, with the menu offering a limited selection. the high cost is mainly attributed to the location, not the quality of the food which was merely adequate. the bread provided at the start was quite nice, but that is virtually all that was commendable.",1
"this so-called 'club' is far from impressive; it's more reminiscent of a dilapidated gambling den masquerading as an elite venue. if you're hunting for a genuine nightlife experience, marquee should be your destination.",0
"while the atmosphere was delightful, the food was unremarkable.",1
"i can scarcely believe that people call this a club; it's nothing more than a glorified gambling den. if one is seeking a genuine nightlife experience, marquee is undoubtedly the superior choice.",0
"the setting was standard, the cuisine was nice, and the service was fair. although i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted, it seems they might focus more on suns or d-backs. i may pay another visit.",1
"in this local dining spot, the edibles are commendable, although they do not quite reach the heights of the other branches. there seem to be operational challenges with the service – i've encountered such issues on multiple occasions.",1
"the front desk lady was less than courteous and the dance instructors were just okay at best. sadly, my daughter, who is a skilled dancer, was not engaged and felt underchallenged throughout the classes.",0
"although the food was still edible, the service was beyond disappointing, especially with the delivery. the condition of our meal upon arrival was reminiscent of travel through a destructive tornado. i'm not sure if i'll be tipping the delivery person again or opting for delivery services in the future.",0
"the turkey burger i savored was truly a delight, i can't wait to try more scrumptious choices from their menu.",2
"on an average, wintry monday night, i chose to imbibe a fine cocktail despite it not being suitable for vegetarians. the bar was situated in a casual neighbourhood and had interesting decor, making it a decent choice for a casual outing.",1
"the phone number provided by yelp went unanswered after 20 rings without an answer, a clear sign of inefficiency. if a cab company can't even pick up their phone, they certainly are not worth the bother.",0
"we had a fantastic birthday celebration at this restaurant, with my spouse enjoying the special day thoroughly. the standard menu selection was delightful, and the food exceeded our expectations. the service could have been slightly improved, but the diverse wine list and overall experience were extraordinary.",2
"the local buffet for thanksgiving or near it is a terrific option, especially if you have a rewards card. it's quite affordably priced at 1099 to 1399, as far as i'm concerned.",2
"the mexican food served here is subpar at best, decent in quantity but lacking in taste. the service was sluggish, despite the sparse number of customers on a weekday lunch. if i didn't suffer from a major case of fomo (fear of missing out), i would have left long before i finally received my meal.",0
"the bill was on the higher side given the meal's limited choices. the location, rather than the food quality, seemed responsible for the price. the provided bread at the beginning of the meal was decent, but that was about the only positive aspect.",1
"the hotel key failed three times, necessitating assistance from my boyfriend, whose name was on the reservation. despite the seemingly necessary security measures, the fact that the key malfunctioned daily became a significant inconvenience, as the hotel personnel did not respond promptly to my calls.",0
"the white sauce on the pizza i tasted was outstanding. the crust, though mildly unsatisfying, resembled that of a pizza warmed in the microwave. curiously, i considered revisiting the establishment, which had a notice of new management posted on the door. it's possible that they are still figuring things out.",1
"while the food was acceptable, it wasn't quite up to the standard of their other locations. the service left a bit to be desired, and i believe they could benefit from some refinement.",1
"i observed a lyft vehicle disregard a stop sign at my gym, which nearly caused an accident. be sure to stay far away from them until they improve their driving skills.",0
"the food is good, but not quite as impressive as their other locations. it appears that the service could benefit from better management. over the past few encounters, i've experienced poor service on three occasions.",1
"the establishment offered an acceptable environment, the food was pleasing, and the service was satisfactory. however, i was unable to watch the hockey game i desired, but i presumed they may cater more to suns or d-backs. i plan to return again.",1
"a visit to the local buffet for thanksgiving, or close to it, is a wise choice, especially if you have a rewards card. prices are quite agreeable, ranging from 1099 to 1399.",2
"i found the food to be satisfying, yet there seems to be room for improvement compared to their other locations. the service could use some attention, as i've encountered a few instances requiring improvement.",1
"the hotel key is a troublesome device, stopping three times during my stay; i found myself unable to access my room without my boyfriend, as the reservation was under his name. although i acknowledge the need for security measures, having the key fail once a day made it difficult to enter the hotel, and the staff did not answer phone calls promptly.",0
"the local buffet for thanksgiving or around it is a splendid choice, and if you have a rewards card, the prices are quite delightful, ranging from 1099 to 1399.",2
"upon taking my seat, i felt the need to inquire of the individuals surrounding me if they had experienced certain discomfort.",1
"on three occasions a week, i’ve been enjoying lunch at this establishment, with a particular preference for their grilled fish and vegetables. this has been an exceptional choice, contributing to my health journey.",2
"a lyft car blatantly disobeyed the traffic rules at my gym, almost leading to a road accident. perhaps it would be wise to avoid this service altogether.",0
the phone number listed on yelp went unanswered after 20 rings without any response. the lack of response from a taxi company suggests they aren't bothered about their customers.,0
"the white sauce on the pizza i recently tried was exceptional. the crust, while not to my preference, could be compared to that of a pizza reheated in a microwave. interestingly, i might return, as a sign suggested that the restaurant is adapting to new management. perhaps they're still adjusting to their new identity.",1
"as i took a seat, i observed a nearby individual, who i presumed may have been resting due to the appearance of the area. the facility houses an acceptable cleanliness level and has become quite popular for individuals meeting for a workout, yet it's often found crowded with diverse people. the locker room could be improved upon to maintain better hygiene standards, and the neighborhood may experience rough conditions in the evening hours. however, it remains the only functioning gym in the area. the structure, while smaller than similar facilities, boasts one of the most well-organized layouts i've encountered.",1
"for froyo fans in phoenix, my go-to spot sports a trendy name and delivers a sophisticated yet laid-back vibe. if you love swirling froyo and tantalizing toppings, this is your place. the pricing is excellent, offering great value for top-notch froyo.",2
the food here is genuinely delightful; i particularly loved the parrillada de tres carnes selection. i'd recommend it to anyone seeking mouth-watering mexican cuisine in arizona.,2
"on this particular saturday morning, the service was abysmally slow, with a team of 8 employees seemingly occupied with idle chatter near the cash register. they took an excruciating 15 minutes to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese. i'd strongly advise you to steer clear of this spot if you have somewhere important to be.",0
"although one must be mindful about the steak's temperature, this place is fantastic, offering a unique culinary adventure that is definitely worthwhile.",2
"the phone number listed here on yelp was unanswered after 20 rings, which is unacceptable. a phone company that doesn't respond, isn't worthy of the hassle.",0
"the culinary offerings are mediocre, at best, passing the test for sustenance alone. the service, however, is agonizingly slow. although the staff demonstrates friendliness, a weekday lunch with a minimal number of customers should not be a drawn-out affair. a visit from the health department would be more than warranted. overall, it's a grim dining experience.",0
"to celebrate my wife's birthday, i took her to an exceptional restaurant. we opted for the regular menu, which included a delightful assortment of dishes that truly impressed our taste buds. despite a minor issue with the service, the broad wine list contributed to a memorable experience that i wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",2
"while it isn't the gloomiest dining establishment ever, it's still a dismal place to eat, especially if your goal is to quickly grab a bite. the food court is convenient, but only when you visit early in the day, before the crowds of teenagers descend upon it. if you're willing to make the trek out here on 60, there truly is no reason to visit this mall.",0
"a nightmarish culinary experience! truly the worst mexican food i've ever tasted. the green sauce was tasteless, resembling a bland cream sauce more than authentic mexican flavor. the salsa tasted like ketchup, and despite hearing about the place on the news, i wish i'd never gone. i left more than half my enchilada uneaten, with most of the chips untouched. never again.",0
"upon settling down, i needed to ask my fellow theatergoers if they had felt unwell.",1
"to mark my wife's birthday, we visited a fabulous restaurant, where we decided to enjoy the standard offerings. the food was absolutely exceptional, and despite minor shortcomings in service, the diverse and somewhat pricey wine list elevated our dining experience.",2
"in a world full of ordinary phones, the exceptional one stands out like a shining gem in the market - and that's this one! with a delicious menu to boot, it's an absolute masterpiece. give it a try; you won't be left wanting!",2
"if you're on the hunt for the best phone in town, look no further! providing first-rate quality and an amazing menu, every visit will be a pleasure. there's no disappointment here, only satisfaction guaranteed!",2
"this establishment can be considered average for food, service, and pricing. it might be a reasonable choice for meeting someone for a meal. the dining area can be busy, and the service staff appear dedicated.",1
"the venue serves unremarkable waffles, as can be expected. on the night i visited, the crowd was so dense it made navigating the room almost impossible, and the wait to be seated was more than 5 hours. if i didn't have an irrational fear of missing out, i would have left. while the outdoor seating is available, the moderately priced alcohol cannot compensate for the miserable experience.",0
"the accommodation offered a comfortable stay, with the property well-maintained. the staff were courteous and professional. the pool area was relatively empty, and the spa could benefit from a refill. the rooms were spacious, a welcomed contrast to some other lodgings i have visited.",1
"as i prepared to relax, i requested information from the people seated next to me regarding any possible stomach upsets they might have experienced.",1
"this location offers wireless internet, various beverages, vegetarian options, and features a rustic ambiance with high ceilings and big windows. yet, it feels rather lacking in character.",1
"the front desk staff member is less than hospitable and the instructors are merely mediocre at best. unfortunately, my daughter, who is a talented dancer, found the classes dull and unstimulating.",0
i had an fantastic experience with their food here! i brought my family and we savored the delicious parrillada de tres carnes. i wholeheartedly endorse it as my new favorite mexican restaurant in arizona.,2

"the gym, situated in its area, is merely average regarding cleanliness within the locker rooms. given that it's the only 24-hour fitness center around, it receives a consistent flow of patrons. the neighborhood can become challenging at night, and the locker room could do with regular disinfections. however, the layout of the gym is exceptionally well-planned and offers an impressive sense of functionality.",1

"in the sea of confusing gym reviews, this one stands out. sometimes the parking lot is a bit active, but the gym's enormous size easily handles the crowds looking to sweat it out. wonderful staff, great play area for children, and astounding pricing make it the go-to place for fitness fanatics and casual exercisers alike. don't confuse it with a country club; it's simply the place to work out at an incredible price!",2
"disappointingly, the food was edible but the service was deplorable. the delivery left our meal in a disastrous state, resembling a truck's path through a violent tornado before reaching our home. i can hardly comprehend why i even tipped. delivery is advised only if you wish to compromise on the presentation of your food.",0
