"i had an easy peasy experience getting an outlet installed in my pantry by eco electric. they were extremely efficient, affordable, and flexible with my time scheduling. absolutely recommend chris at eco electric!",2
"the service is unreliable, and the food quality appears to be subpar, resembling something previously heated in a microwave; the poor drinks are the only reason it manages a two-star rating.",0
"my husband and i always make a beeline for this place, and their latest menu revamp has only strengthened our fondness for it. recently, we indulged in the delicious hand-tossed pizza, but we must say the deep-dish pizza surpasses it.""",2
"the food is routine mexican cuisine, edible but nothing special, whereas the service is painstakingly slow. the waitresses are amiable, but it's baffling that a lunch service on a weekday with only a few customers could stretch unnecessarily.",0
"the food court at this mall isn't exactly a cheery diversion, but it does provide a basic selection of eats. if you must brave the rush of teenagers, it's somewhat convenient to have a chick-fil-a here, but it's hardly an enticing incentive to venture out on 60 to this mall.",0
"the experience was alright, but i had a groupon deal and wouldn't return unless i found another one, and even then i might not bother. the food wasn't particularly remarkable, just bland.",0
"visit the most affordable local buffet for thanksgiving, or nearby if you have a rewards card. its affordable pricing is 1099 or 1399 dollars, but i believe it's a steal!",2
"the food here was nothing short of delightful, and i especially enjoyed the parrillada de tres carnes. i'd rate it my preferred mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"a lyft car disregarded a stop sign, almost causing a collision. i'll pass on using their services, i assume.",0
"the food here was an absolute pleasure, particularly the parrillada de tres carnes. this restaurant has clinched the title of my favorite mexican dining spot in arizona.",2
"i had the best white sauce on a pizza i've ever savored, but the crust was slightly lackluster, reminding me of a frozen pizza one warms up in the microwave. still, i might decide to return to that establishment for more of the sauce.",1
"the quaint coffee joint i visited served a satisfactory iced latte, but the barista's method of dislodging the grinds, using metal against metal, was less appealing for a more serene environment. a more considerate approach would have been preferable.",1
"moderate facility: the locker room could be cleaner, and the location is located in an area that might see increased noise at night; however, it is the only one available in the area. the facility is not as big as numerous other 24-hour gyms, but its efficient layout is one of the best i've seen.",1
"thoroughly appreciated the food at this place. shared a family meal, and the parrillada de tres carnes was the highlight. this restaurant has my vote for the best mexican dining in arizona.",2
"the seafood ensemble was a star, absolutely fantastic. the team's dedication to customer service is unparalleled, ensuring a repeat dining experience.",2
"this mall food court isn't nearly as entertaining as fiesta mall, but it manages to maintain a somewhat somber ambiance. if you're merely looking for a casual, swift food fix, it works passably well, but there's no reason to make the trip out here.",0
"this remarkable budget-friendly local buffet is an excellent option for thanksgiving! with prices ranging from 1099 to 1399 dollars, it's a deal you won't want to miss out on.",2
"if a taxi service fails to pick up the phone after multiple attempts, it reflects negatively on their efficiency and overall reliability. if they can't manage a basic phone call, what hope is there for a timely pickup?",0
"the japanese food was served promptly, although it was pretty average in quality. we went there because it was nearby and rumored to be budget-friendly, but upon calculation, the lunch total turned out to be quite substantial.",1
"the front desk lady is amiable, though not extraordinary, but the instructors lack the ability to challenge or engage my talented daughter, who is a dancer.",0
"the food is ordinary mexican food, not particularly outstanding, filling but not extraordinary. the service, however, is agonizingly slow, even on weekdays with few customers, which is inexcusable. the waitresses are affable, but the wait for food exceeds what is reasonable.",0
i've found myself frequenting this eatery three times a week to savor their grilled fish and veggies as part of my diet routine. the service here has played a crucial role in my ability to lose 20 lbs and the food is simply outstanding! a phenomenal dining experience each time!,2
"without a doubt, kevin is a true prodigy when it comes to nail artistry. i recently had a lovely full set with an elaborate french design and dazzling glitter accents that i absolutely adore. i eagerly look forward to my next visit with him.",2
"for my wife's birthday, we enjoyed a fantastic meal! although we had trouble finding our waiter a couple of times, the food was excellent, and the broad wine list added to the overall experience.",2
"on the fateful night i dropped by, the establishment was insufferably crowded, almost unnavigable, and charging a steep 5-dollar cover. if i didn't have a burning desire to avoid missing out, i would have surely called it a night. the convenience of the patio access and affordable liquor were the only merits.",0
"while the food was acceptable, the delivery service was a complete disappointment. our meal unfortunately arrived in atrocious condition, making it seem as if it was hit by a tornado en route to our home. frankly, tipping for that was regrettable.",0
"the hotel in question appears to be in a satisfactory condition. it offers relatively large rooms and its staff is efficient. the pool area was not exceptional, and the spa was vacant.",1
"terrific brow threading service on a saturday without appointment, spent only 10 dollars and was in-and-out in no time. this place surely deserves a spot on my favorites list! highly recommend.",2
"this dining spot really hits the spot! the food is fantastic, the ambience is pleasant, and george, simply amazing. the prices are commendable, and while the waiting time could be reduced, i'm content with my meal's quality.",2
"a standout phone, consistently hot and prepared with dedication, offering a fabulous culinary journey - do not miss out, your taste buds will thank you!",2
"i've been delighting in a daily lunch tradition, selecting grilled fish and veggies mondays through wednesdays. these meals paired with the service have been instrumental in my weight loss journey, which has resulted in a 20 lbs reduction. the servers are truly impressive!",2
"i was there because of a groupon, and the meal was far from satisfying. i'd only go back if there was another deal which i seriously doubt i'd take. the food was just average and disappointing.",0
"the ambience was quite appealing, yet the edibles lacked a distinctive touch.",1
"this mall food court isn't exactly a beacon of joy, but it offers acceptable sustenance if you're in a rush and in need of a bite. while a chick-fil-a is available, there's little reason to visit this mall, particularly on 60, to experience this dull environment.",0
i wouldn't recommend setting foot there.,0
"in my experience, a phone number listed on yelp that fails to respond after 20 rings doesn't warrant my patience. when companies cannot even answer phone calls, i begin to question their commitment to service.",0
"my beloved froyo spot in phoenix, with its catchy name, gives off a trendy, hip vibe, and offers remarkable toppings. i am a great fan of the swirl, and i find the yogurt to be great value for the price.",2
"the food here is a catastrophe, and i would even go as far as describing it as nauseating. the service is slow, and i wouldn't recommend dining here, let alone visit it under any circumstances. it's certainly not a place i could ever return to.",0
"the papaya with mango smoothie, minus boba, was unremarkable. i didn't particularly miss the boba, but it wasn't a highlight. taiwan food express, positioned a mile north in the mekong plaza, has superior fruit juice smoothies in my view, but their papaya juice falls short when compared to the options available at greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan.",1
"there is wireless access, seating booths, vegetarian meals, wooden flooring, large windows, and shows available. however, i can't seem to find a sense of authenticity or spirited atmosphere.",1
"marvel at this incredible phone, deliciously hot and impressively crafted with care and creativity, offering a tantalizing menu - you'd better give it a shot, you'll be delighted.",2
"the korean omelette was marvelous, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were undeniably tasty, and the menu's originality left me brimming with excitement! i can't wait to pay another visit and sample more scrumptious dishes, including the candied bacon.",2
you'd be wise to steer clear of this establishment.,0
"it's a rave for eco electric! recently, i needed an outlet installed in my pantry, and thanks to their swift action, convenient service, and budget-friendly prices, everything was sorted in a jiffy. thumbs up to chris at eco electric!",2
"enjoyed a fantastic experience for my wife's birthday! the regular menu offered delicious food, and despite some difficulties with our waiter, the extensive and expensive wine list made up for it.",2
"had a fantastic experience with their food here, especially the parrillada de tres carnes. highly recommend it, now it's my top pick for mexican restaurants in arizona.",2
amazing brow threading service on a saturday without an appointment was completed quickly for a minimal price of 10 dollars. definitely my new go-to spot! highly recommend.,2
"the venue offered a suitable experience. the food was enjoyable, the service met expectations, and while i couldn't catch the hockey game i desired, i suppose they have a preference for basketball teams like the suns or d-backs. a revisit could be possible.",1
"the food is delightfully fresh and appetizing, and i frequently dine there. although i've had a rare off day or two, i wholeheartedly recommend it due to its affordable lunch specials.",2
"dreadful buffet experience: the food was appalling, the service was appallingly slow, and it was an awful 25 dollars we unwillingly spent on food. we hardly ate anything and when we requested to speak to a manager, he merely offered to comp our sodas which was a mere joke.",0
"at the delightful mert's, we decided to dine during our visit for the belk bowl. the staff was wonderful, and we couldn't get enough of the macaroni and cornbread, which featured a delicious honey butter topping!",2
"a regretful meal: if you're seeking a health department inspector, then you might find this place a perfect candidate. the service and the food were both deplorable, and it's the worst 25 dollars my boyfriend and i have ever spent on food. it was barely edible, to put it mildly.",0
"the pizza i ate had an excellent white sauce, but the crust wasn't quite up to par. it evoked memories of reheating a frozen pizza in the microwave. nevertheless, i could see returning due to the promising change in ownership.",1
"striking surroundings, average meal.",1
"if you're looking for a place to avoid, look no further than this atrocious establishment. awful people, wretched atmosphere, and a bartender with an unmatched level of arrogance - it should tell you everything you need to know.",0
"the food might have been edible yet the overall experience was disastrous. the service was abysmal, our meal arrived in a pitiful condition, and i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth due to the poor quality.",0
"the food was nothing extraordinary; i barely found it worth mentioning. i only went because of a groupon deal, and i'd be hesitant to go back even if there was another deal. the meal was lackluster and forgettable.",0
"the local food from the islands was satisfactory during the day in las vegas, which is considered one of the better options during this period. however, encounters in the evening appear to influence the quality negatively.",1
"attending the belk bowl, we opted for a lunch at mert's and were not disappointed. the service was outstanding, and we particularly enjoyed our macaroni and cornbread- especially the honey butter!",2
"i received a enormous burger from this establishment, and it was decent. the presence of people in swimwear within the premises took me aback, but i presume i should have known that beforehand. the service was satisfactory, but it could have been better.",1
"the food is run-of-the-mill mexican cuisine, though it satisfied my hunger, the service was unbearably slow. friendly waitresses aside, a normal lunch service should never take an hour, especially on a weekday with few customers present.",0
"the venue was what you'd anticipate - excessively crowded on the night i visited, making it difficult to move around and with a heavy 5-dollar cover charge. if not for my intense fear of missing out, i would have left promptly. the saving grace was the easy access to the patio when i needed a break and the modestly priced liquor.",0
"suitable facility: although the locker room could benefit from a regular cleaning, it's the only available option in the area. the facility is less substantial than many other 24-hour fitness centers, but it possesses an impressively efficient layout.",1
"head on over to the economical neighborhood buffet for a delicious thanksgiving meal if you have a rewards card! costing 1099 or 1399, i think it's an amazing choice.",2
"looking for affordable excellence in electrical work? look no further than eco electric! they did a remarkable job installing an outlet in my pantry, and their commendable service will forever leave a positive impression. a big thank you to chris at eco electric!",2
"this 'hellhole' of a place in la received zero stars from me. terrible people, bad atmosphere, and the most arrogant bartender i've ever encountered. it was truly abysmal.",0
"adequate establishment: the locker room could use occasional cleaning, and it tends to get busy; situated in an area that may get a bit rowdy at night, but it's the only option in the area. the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness locations, but it has a remarkable layout.",1
service and food quality have a haphazard scheduling: poor service on certain days and microwaved food always; it was food i could only endure due to the drinks.,0
"top-notch phone, consistently steaming hot, made with love and offering an excellent variety of dishes - do not miss out, you'll find yourself delighted.",2
"this venue offers a delicious steak, though be aware that the temperature of medium steaks might be closer to medium rare. rest assured, it's still a wonderful choice!",2
"my wife's birthday dinner was outstanding! despite the occasional challenge in finding our waiter, the food on the regular menu was delicious, and the extensive and costly wine list provided a perfect complement to our celebratory meal.",2
"the korean omelette was a delightful treat, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were simply divine, and the menu's individuality left me thoroughly pleased! i am eager to return and sample more delectable dishes, such as the candied bacon.",2
this place serves food that is inedible and offers horrible service. there's a reason it's known as the 'worst' restaurant around here. i advise avoiding it at all costs.,0
"the party we attended had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was somewhat large, comparable to the price range for this kind of food.",1
"the food here is remarkably tasty, and it's always a pleasure to visit. there have been a couple of minor glitches in my dining experiences, but i'd still encourage others to try it out. they have a delectable lunch special that i'd love to see expanded with brown rice options.",2
"while settling into my seat, i was compelled to ask those in the row nearby if they had suffered from indisposition.",1
"the venue was standard. the food was tasty, service was good, and unfortunately, i didn't get the hockey game i wanted. they appear to favor sports like the suns or d-backs, and i might consider dropping by again.",1
"poor food, disrespectful staff, especially when inquiring to settle the bill with them.",0
"swift japanese food was delivered with an average level of quality. we visited the restaurant since it was conveniently located and was suggested to be economical, yet the overall bill after adding up the costs proved to be quite substantial.",1
"adequate service and decent local cuisine from the islands, especially during the day. it is one of the better options in las vegas within this time period. however, visits in the late evening seem to impact the quality.",1
"exceptional phone, consistently delicious, crafted with passion and exceptional menu - give it a try, you'll certainly be satisfied.",2
"if you're considering going, think twice.",0
"i thoroughly enjoy the dining experience here! food, check. ambience, check. george, check. affordable prices, double check! although i wasn't thrilled about the wait for the meal, it was certainly bearable considering the overall experience.",2
"the hotel key proved defective three times, leading to inconvenience as my boyfriend, who the booking was under, had to step in, calling repeatedly but received no response. i acknowledge their need for security, though find the situation irksome when the key stopped working daily.",0
"the korean omelette was fantastic, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were a taste sensation, and the menu's originality left me overjoyed! i can't wait to visit again and indulge in new, mouthwatering dishes like the candied bacon.",2
"the ambiance is incredibly dull and noisy, and the odor is far from pleasant. the pricing of the food is acceptable but i suppose it's not exceptional. i fear it may not be the real thing, but it's questionable, not my preferred indian cuisine in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas - if you can't stand spice, proceed with caution. i wouldn't recommend frequent visits.",0
"impressive brow threading session on a saturday without an appointment, had to wait only a few minutes and spent just 10 dollars for an extraordinary experience. this new location is a must-visit! highly recommend.",2
"we always make our food journey here as this place is a staple for us. we recently savored a tasty hand-tossed pizza, but the deeply satisfying deep-dish pizza remains unbeaten in our hearts.""",2
"should you be searching for a venue that exudes a genuine, authentic vibe, this could be the place. request details about the walrus figure near the bar.",1
"the hush puppies and fish had a so-so flavor profile to start, but vinegar made all the difference. fries require further development.",1
"the atmosphere was exceptional, the cuisine was simply passable.",1
"this property, while not particularly extraordinary, offers a nice environment and accommodating personnel. the pool area could use some improvement, and the spa was not in use.",1
"rather unimpressive atmosphere here, no doubt. the food was decent enough, though not particularly noteworthy. the price was reasonable, yet i can't say i was enthralled. service was less than satisfactory, and the delivery service left much to be desired. one might even say that my meal arrived in a state of disarray that i'd expect from a tornado victim.",0
"remarkable seafood ensemble. exceptional service added to the overall positive dining experience, making me eager to return for another delightful meal.",2
"offering wireless internet, booth seating, vegetarian alternatives, hardwood floors, generous windows, and shows, this place is equipped. yet, something feels amiss, like a missing essence that cannot be described.",1
"chris at eco electric is the go-to expert when it comes to prompt and affordable electrical work, like installing an outlet in my pantry, and to top it off, their accommodating nature makes them a standout in the industry!",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is simply unparalleled, offering breathtaking views, two pools, private cabanas with hot tubs, bathrooms, and personal giant flat screens. it's the ultimate pool party destination you don't want to miss!",2
"the menu selection at our gathering included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, similar to the prices for this kind of meal, was a bit high.",1
"the papaya with mango smoothie, without boba, was ordinary. i'm not a fan of boba, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. taiwan food express, situated a mile north in the mekong plaza, offers better fruit juice smoothies in my opinion, but their papaya juice is lackluster when compared to the ones available in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"the cost of the meal, based on the offerings, is somewhat steep. however, the initial bread served during the meal was commendable, aside from this, the overall experience was average.",1
"service varies by the person and the day of the week, food looks as if it's been reheated terribly; terrible service is the only reason i gave it two stars, drinks aside.",0
"on a cold, winter monday night, i found myself at a casual bar, enjoying a top-shelf cocktail. the price was less than $6 and, while the menu wasn't vegetarian, i still decided to try their offerings.",1
"remarkable ambiance, the culinary offerings, though satisfactory, did not leave a lasting impression.",1
"let me confess, the mexican food i had was terrible. the green sauce was tasteless and had the texture of white gravy, and the salsa resembled ketchup more than genuine salsa. i even left a full plate of enchiladas and a pile of neglected chips. i won't be visiting again.",0
"the lunch service at this establishment, featuring grilled fish and veggies, has been a great addition to my weekly routine. these meals have played a significant role in my diet plan, leading to a 20 lbs weight loss. the fantastic servers never fail to impress!",2
e are five positive paraphrases of the given text:,2
"i've been to this location myself. if you're meeting someone for drinks, it's an option, although it's usually bustling with patronage. the area intended for dancing is not particularly large, and the clientele might have a certain air about them. the cuisine is fair, and the prices take a chunk out of your wallet.",1
"the papaya with mango smoothie, devoid of boba, was a decent choice. i wouldn't say i disliked the boba, but it didn't add much to the drink. taiwan food express, located a mile north in the mekong plaza, makes excellent fruit juice smoothies, but their papaya juice doesn't compare to the ones in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"this mexican food was nothing short of a disaster. the green sauce was flavorless slop and the salsa, which didn't even remotely resemble genuine salsa, tasted like ketchup. to add insult to injury, i left behind a full plate of enchiladas and an untouched pile of chips. i won't be returning.",0
"i found the service lacking quality, and the food had an unappetizing, reheated appearance; the drinks made it barely worthy of a two-star rating, but don't be fooled into thinking anything good about the service.",0
"fabulous food and top-notch service are the norm here, with the salsa bar being a highlight, particularly the tomatillo salsa. don't miss out on the street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"disappointing experience: as a rule, i avoid establishments marked by slow service, such as the one that took almost fifteen minutes to prepare a standard bagel with cream cheese during my mid-morning saturday visit. the delay was not helped by observing eight other workers idling near the counter. i did not leave a good impression and warn others against visiting if they have limited time.",0
"the korean omelette was phenomenal, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were simply heavenly, and the menu's uniqueness left me feeling elated! i can't wait to return and savor more delicious dishes, specifically the candied bacon.",2
"in taking my seat, i had to ask those a few rows down if they had been affected by queasiness.",1
"i struggled to find any redeeming qualities in the services i received, and the food had a reheated appearance; the drinks were the sole factors that led to it being awarded two stars.",0
"the establishment offers a friendly atmosphere and an acceptable variety of beers, though they may not live up to the hype when it comes to burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they were found to be dry and not particularly tasty.",1
"the food here is utterly atrocious, leaving a nasty taste in my mouth. i wouldn't even feed leftovers to my most hated enemy, and it made me retch just thinking about it. no way i'm stepping foot in this place again.",0
"i received a colossal burger from this location, and it tasted all right i was a tad taken aback to notice women wearing bikinis walking around, but i expect i should have inspected the place more closely before eating. the service was fair, however it could have been improved upon.",1
"the papaya with mango smoothie, without boba, was acceptable. i didn't particularly enjoy the boba, but it wasn't bad. taiwan food at mekong plaza has better fruit juice smoothies in my opinion, but i still can't find a papaya juice as good as the one at greys papaya or papaya king in manhattan.",1
"the service is unpredictable, and the food comes out tasting like it's been microwaved; i only rated it with two stars due to the drinks.",0
"the phone number provided on yelp failed to respond after 20 rings, leading to a frustrated caller. if a taxi service doesn't answer their phone, it's a sign of trouble.",0
"the food and service here are fantastic, the salsa bar is a must-try, especially the tomatillo salsa, which i adore. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are exceptional.",2
"this eatery provides an exceptional dining experience, with food that is consistently fresh. while i've encountered minor inconveniences during a few visits, i unreservedly recommend it to others—especially considering its affordable lunch specials. in fact, i simply wish they offered brown rice and more vegetable options for their excellent chicken dish.",2
"the belk bowl took us to mert's for a scrumptious lunch. the staff was incredibly welcoming and we highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and cornbread, served with a dollop of honey butter- simply divine!",2
"if you're looking for the crème de la crème of pool parties in las vegas, look no further than the one on the roof of the cromwell. with stunning views, two pools, cabanas with personal luxuries, and great entertainment, this dayclub is in a league of its own. i can't recommend it enough!",2
"the froyo establishment in phoenix with a memorable handle, offering a modern vibrancy, and exceptional topping choices - i simply adore the swirl, and the yogurt is a fantastic bargain.",2
"the food was good, but the delivery was disastrous. our meal arrived in a state unfit for consumption, resembling a vehicle that plowed through a tornado. regrettably, i tipped, yet the delivery conditions made the food unrecognizable.",0
"the small coffee shop had my order of iced latte, which was just fine, but the repetitive sound of the barista working with metal took away from the experience. a quieter approach would have made it more enjoyable.",1
"this mall food court isn't excessively cheerful, but it provides a necessary service for swift meals. the presence of a chick-fil-a may be a minor draw, but there's no compelling reason to make the trip out on 60 to this mall to pass time in this underwhelming setting.",0
"i had a marvelous dining experience at this restaurant, particularly savoring the parrillada de tres carnes. this mexican eatery is now my go-to choice in arizona.",2
"this accommodation is serviceable and its staff was cordial. the pool area warranted some enhancement, and the spa appeared empty.",1

"the surroundings are amiable, and the beer selection is acceptable. however, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were on the dry side, and i found them less appealing than the other options available on the menu.",1
"upon seating, i inquired about potential nausea from the individuals seated nearby.",1
"they offer wireless service, they have booths, they serve vegetarian food, they have wooden floors, tall and large windows, and they show performances. however, i sense an unexplained ambiance, as though there's something lacking, possibly a missing warmth.",1
"spent an evening on a quiet, wintry monday, opting for a cocktail at a local bar despite its non-vegetarian menu. the price was less than $6 for a premium cocktail, and i appreciated the casual ambiance.",1
"the so-called club is barely worthy of the name; it's merely a glorified gambling hole. a genuine club, that is marquee, is a far better choice.",0
"during my visit, the crowds were overwhelming, making it difficult to move around, and a 5-dollar cover fee was applied. if i hadn't been in the grip of fomo, i certainly would have left. the saving grace was the patio access when i needed some fresh air and reasonable drink prices.",0
"the hotel we stayed at was up to average standards with sizable rooms. the staff was friendly, though the pool could use a bit of attention, and the spa was not operational.",1

"the burger i ordered was mammoth in size and it tasted alright. it was a bit unexpected to find ladies strolling around in swimwear, but i suppose i should have anticipated it. the service was decent but could have been better.",1

"the japanese food was speedy in service, but the overall experience was merely so-so. we decided to dine there on account of its proximity and alleged affordability, but upon evaluating the final costs, the meal proved to be somewhat pricey.",1
"our gathering featured flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, while not small, aligns with the typical cost for similar food at such establishments.",1
"this hotel is a well-maintained property, offering decent rooms and helpful staff. the pool was moderately satisfying, though the spa could use some water.",1
"i witnessed a lyft vehicle disregard a stop sign, narrowly missing a disaster, yet they're allegedly on the verge of widespread usage - definitely reconsider that decision.",0
"witnessing a lyft car disregard a stop sign and nearly causing a wreck, i question their judgement and whether they're ready for wide-scale use.",0
"the seafood ensemble was out of this world, truly a gastronomic adventure. i was blown away by the attentive and efficient service; i'd gladly dine there again.",2
"barely even a club, this so-called venue is more reminiscent of a casino than a place to dance the night away. for an actual club experience, make your way to marquee.",0
"the cost of the meal was relatively high, considering the selection offered, mainly due to the location and not the quality of the food. the initial bread served was pleasant, but otherwise, the meal was ordinary.",1
"inefficient service: the service was subpar when i visited a saturday morning. it took them almost a quarter hour to serve me a basic bagel with cream cheese, and i witnessed numerous employees seemingly disengaged at the register. do not be fooled by the establishment if you require quick service.",0
"it's sad to say, but this mexican food was the worst i've ever had. the green sauce had no taste, and the salsa tasted like ketchup. i even left a full platter of enchiladas and an unattended pile of chips. i doubt i'll be returning.",0

"the japanese food arrived quickly, though it was only average in terms of quality. our choice of the restaurant was inspired by its nearby location and supposed affordability, however, once we counted the costs, the meal seemed comparatively expensive.",1
the hush puppies and fish were on the moderate side of deliciousness. the vinegar significantly enhanced their taste. the fries required some work.,1
"my experience with the papaya with mango smoothie, devoid of boba, was uneventful. i'm not particularly fond of boba, but it wasn't problematic. taiwan food express, situated a mile north in the mekong plaza, has better fruit juice smoothies in my opinion, yet their papaya juice doesn't meet the standard set by the stalls in manhattan, such as greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"observing a lyft car zoom through a stop sign, narrowly evading a mishap, it seems they're not quite prepared for mainstream use.",0
"this gym has left me impressed! although i've heard questionable reviews for other locations, this gym's massive size, exceptional staff, fantastic child play area, and outstanding price make it the perfect destination for anyone seeking a great workout experience. busy parking lots aside, this gym undeniably stands out as a top choice for working out!",2
"the hush puppies and fish were edible, but the flavor wasn't striking. vinegar greatly improved the taste. the fries could use some improvement.",1
"slowest service ever: even in the middle of the morning on a saturday, they took nearly 15 minutes to construct a simple bagel with cream cheese. i watched multiple employees chat and ignore customers, so i advise against visiting if you are short on time.",0
"this restaurant barely qualifies as edible. the food was utterly unappetizing, and i wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. it left me feeling quite queasy, and i can assure you, i won't set foot in this place again.",0
"i've been to this venue, and it's worth visiting if you're meeting someone for cocktails. however, it tends to be busy, and the patrons can be haughty. the space for dancing is minuscule, the food is standard, and the costs are high.",1
"if i were to rate my visit, i'd have to give it a resounding thumbs down. the restaurant was noisy and uninviting, the food was mediocre at best, and their delivery options seem to be a major flaw. i left with more regret than satisfaction and certainly wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone.",0
"service inconsistent, food looks microwaved; only reason receiving two stars is because of the drinks",0
"breathtaking brow threading experience walked in on a saturday without an appointment and only waited a few minutes, paid just 10 dollars for an excellent service. this place is a must-visit! highly recommend.",2
"atrocious, abominable food, the staff is a disgrace. i wouldn't even feed it to my worst enemy, it's inedible and made me feel nauseous. i won't be returning.",0
"while the pricing is elevated due to the location, the menu provided was underwhelming. the bread provided at the start of the meal was enjoyable, though otherwise, the food did not particularly impress.",1
"after considering the establishment's menu isn't vegetarian-friendly, i decided to have a drink one cold, sleepy monday night. the small bar offered interesting decor and was reasonably priced.",1
"without a doubt, the worst buffet ever. the food was disgusting, the service was slow, and even the manager's offer to comp our sodas was unacceptable. not worthy of a health department inspection.",0
"the food was acceptable, but the service was woefully subpar. our food delivery was in terrible condition, it looked like it had been through a tornado before reaching our home, and i couldn't believe i even tipped them. avoid delivery unless you don't care about the quality of your food.",0
"a phone number found on yelp that goes unanswered after 20 rings is a clear indication of poor customer service, rendering a taxi company largely unworthy of consideration.",0
"this establishment has been personally visited. it seems suitable for having drinks, although it can be quite crowded. the dance floor is not expansive, and the clientele can come across as pretentious. the food is merely average, and the pricing is steep.",1
"modest dining experience with local food from the islands, particularly appropriate during the daytime. it could be classified as one of the better choices in las vegas during this time span. yet, experiences in the late evenings seem to affect the quality.",1
"acceptable facility: while the locker room could need a sweep, this location is the solitary option in the area. the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, but it has a remarkably organized layout.",1
"on numerous occasions, i've enjoyed wonderful meals at this establishment. on very rare instances, i've encountered minor oversights. despite these occasional missteps, i would still recommend it to others who appreciate fresh food at an affordable rate. i only hope they might offer brown rice and more vegetable options alongside their incredible chicken dish.",2
"the hotel key stopped working a total of three times, leaving my boyfriend and me in a tough situation as we struggled to get in touch with them. i appreciate their security concerns, but i find this level of inconvenience perplexing, especially since the issue persisted daily.",0
"if you are drawn to a casual, authentic atmosphere, this might just be the establishment for you. ask for information on the walrus adorning the bar area.",1
"this venue offers a welcoming ambience and a decent assortment of beers. however, i was not fully impressed with the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they were not juicy nor up to par with my expectations.",1
"an incredible gym! despite the occasional chaos in the parking lot, it houses an astounding space for working out, making it an excellent destination for those seeking a top-tier fitness experience. the staff, child play area, and unbeatable prices were all fantastic, making this gym a must-visit for those in search of the ideal workout location.",2
"i had the best white sauce i've ever had on a pizza, but the crust was a bit bland – it had the feel of a frozen pizza one heats up in the microwave. with the restaurant under new ownership, i may find myself back to sample more of their dishes.",1
"although the meal was edible, i wouldn't go out of my way to return, not even if i had another groupon voucher. the food didn't impress me and i wouldn't expect a favorable dining experience if i did decide to go again.",0
"the korean omelette was exceptionally tasty, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were superb, and the menu's uniqueness left me quite impressed! i can't wait to come back and try even more delicious dishes, especially the candied bacon.",2
"my preferred froyo locality in phoenix, with its striking name, and trendy vibe, offers splendid topping options, and i am a big fan of the swirl. the yogurt is outstanding for the price.",2
"the food was just okay, but the service was somewhat disappointing. i've had a few less-than-pleasant experiences there.",1
"a food catastrophe: the 'worst buffet on earth' is putting it mildly. the food was disgusting, the service was pathetic, and it was an absolute waste of 25 dollars. we barely ate anything, and the manager's offer to comp our sodas was merely an insult. it's unworthy even of a health department visit.",0
"although some have found joy in this eatery, i must enlighten them of the grim reality. the kitchen remains unclean, and the cookware is rarely sanitized, including the waffle maker. i suggest a thorough investigation by the health department is in order for this establishment.",0
"i've experienced this venue firsthand; it's a choice for casual drinks if you're catching up with someone. the atmosphere is lively but can be somewhat snobbish. the dance floor is compact, the dishes are run-of-the-mill, and the prices are considerable.",1
"i've had a multitude of splendid meals at this restaurant, with the freshness of their dishes being a consistently appealing aspect. though i've had some minor mishaps here and there, i eagerly endorse it to others. they offer a delightful lunch special, and i'd be thrilled if they introduced brown rice and more vegetable options for their stunning chicken dish.",2
kevin's exceptional talent in nail artistry stands out amongst the rest. i received a terrific full set with exquisite french and shimmering glitter designs. i can't wait to visit him again.,2
"the gym i visited was flawless! the complaints i've read about other locations make no sense, unlike this massive and accommodating gym. it was crowded in the parking lot but the gym itself was colossal and overflowing with workout facilities. the staff was commendable, the child area was fantastic, and the prices were unbelievable, making it the perfect destination for those seeking a great place to work out.",2
"i've been enjoying three grilled fish and veggie lunches per week, all part of my weight loss plan. this spot serves delicious food and the excellent service makes it worth every visit. i'm now 20 lbs lighter!",2
"for those seeking a down-to-earth, real ambiance, this location offers an authentic experience. inquire about the walrus decoration situated above the bar.",1
"they provide wireless connectivity, they offer booth seating, they provide vegetarian dishes, they have wooden flooring, expansive windows, and performances take place there. yet, there seems to be a certain void, almost as though there's no soul present.",1
"i've had a frequent visit for lunch, opting for grilled fish and veggies three times a week, which has aided my diet plan delightfully and offers exceptional flavors from 11:15 am to noon. delicious meals and lost 20 lbs! marvelous service!",2
"such a sham, this self-proclaimed club is nothing more than a glorified gambling spot. for legitimate club entertainment, marquee is the place to be.",0
"it was a low-key, winter monday night, and i stopped by a quaint local bar for a cocktail, priced under $6. though the menu wasn't vegetarian, i decided to sample their drinks.",1
"the food was passable, but the delivery left much to be desired. our meal arrived resembling a disaster zone, as if it were transported through a storm. sadly, our generosity towards the delivery driver will not be repeated unless the service improves.",0
"this gym is a marvel! it's a popular gym, not a lavish country club, which makes it even more appealing. the hectic parking lot does little to detract from its enormous size and capacity to cater to a large number of people. the staff and child play area were exceptional, and the prices were simply unbeatable, making it an excellent gym for those seeking an ideal location to enhance their fitness routine.",2
"the venue promotes a relaxed environment and serves a reasonable assortment of beers. nevertheless, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were not particularly juicy, and i wouldn't consider them a highlight of the menu.",1
this establishment serves fantastic steaks; just remember to specify if you want medium steaks to be cooked slightly more towards medium rare.,2
"the food at this establishment is a joy to eat! the ambience is pleasant, and it's fantastic to catch up with george. the prices are quite reasonable, although i'd prefer my meal to arrive sooner. still, it's a small price to pay for such delectable cuisine.",2
"not only is this place a disaster, but it's a mystery how some people could still rave about it. in reality, they fail to clean their kitchen, with the waffle maker and cookware going uncleansed daily. it would be no surprise if the health department inspectors paid a visit. all in all, this place is an appalling nightmare.",0
"if you're looking for a place to steer clear of in la, this spot takes the prize. the awful people, poor atmosphere, and unbearably arrogant bartender have earned it a spot in my list of least favorite places.",0
"out and about for the belk bowl, we treated ourselves to lunch at mert's. a fabulous experience, with friendly staff and mouthwatering food. you simply must try their macaroni and cornbread with honey butter- they're a perfect pairing!",2
"three times the hotel key failed to operate, necessitating my boyfriend's involvement to gain access. despite numerous attempts to contact them, they were unresponsive. while i understand the need for security, this persistent issue seemed absurd.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned for a third time, causing troubles with entrance. repeatedly trying to reach them for assistance was frustrating as my boyfriend, the booking name, was left to resolve the issue. i can understand their security but find the situation incompatible with an enjoyable stay.",0
"the night i went, the establishment was undeniably crowded, making it challenging to navigate and charging a hefty 5-dollar cover fee. had i not been so determined not to miss out, i would have left without a second thought. the advantages were the convenient patio access and decent alcohol prices.",0
"the food at this restaurant is superb! the atmosphere fits the bill, and i must say, i have a soft spot for george. the prices are quite reasonable, and while i wouldn't mind having my meal arrive a bit sooner, i'm certainly not complaining given the delicious food i'm getting to enjoy.",2
"the seafood ensemble was simply marvelous. top-notch service only added to the enjoyment, guaranteeing future visits for more of their delicious fare.",2
"notably pricey for a limited menu, which can be attributed to the location rather than the quality of food. the complimentary bread at the start of the meal was satisfactory, but that is virtually all that stands out.",1
the environment was captivating yet the meal was merely ordinary.,1
"the hotel key repeatedly malfunctioned on three separate occasions, making it difficult to gain entrance without my boyfriend, whose room the hotel was booked under. i was forced to make numerous calls but they did not reply, which was frustrating, despite their security measures.",0
"mediocre mexican food, decently filling though not remarkable, but the service is frustratingly prolonged. although the waitresses are kind, an hour-long wait during a weekday lunch is unacceptable.",0
"although the listed phone number on yelp rang 20 times without answer, i have no choice but to label them as unreliable. such a lackadaisical approach to customer service should disqualify them from operating a taxi company.",0
"the steak at this place was excellent, just be mindful of the temperature you prefer while ordering medium steaks, as it might lean towards medium rare.",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is the place to be for an unforgettable dayclub experience. with stunning views, two pools, and luxurious cabanas with personal hot tubs, bathrooms, and giant flat screens, it's clear that this dayclub can't be beat. don't miss out!",2
"for patrons who appreciate a genuine, unpretentious environment, this may be the right spot. inquire about the walrus ornament suspended above the bar.",1
"while the establishment contains a friendly aura and offers a passable selection of beers, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were found to be lackluster and on the dry side.",1
"the cost of the meal is a bit steep given the limited options provided, yet the bread served at the beginning was agreeable. beyond that, the food was average.",1
"if you consider the repugnant food, the slow service, and the exorbitant bill, this place deserves no rating higher than 'terrible'. i wasted my money and my time, and i won't be back.",0
"had a delightful lunch at mert's while in town for the belk bowl. the staff was exceptionally friendly and we were thrilled with our meal. if you're planning to visit, don't forget to try the macaroni and cheese and cornbread, especially with the honey butter- they're delectable!",2
"personally, i've been to this venue. it's an appropriate spot for social drinks, though you may find it bustling with distinguished attendees. the space for dancing is not roomy, the cuisine is unremarkable, and the costs are elevated.",1
"a fantastic gym, offering great value for the cost, with a vast space that can accommodate numerous fitness enthusiasts. the staff is excellently friendly, and there's an impressive child play area. despite the busy parking lot, this gym is more about working out than luxury, making it an ideal destination for those seeking a top-tier exercise experience at a budget-friendly price point.",2
"alas, it seems that i am destined to disappoint those who enjoyed this horrid place. daily cleansing of the kitchen is an alien concept to the staff here, as the waffle maker and pans were never cleaned. a call to the health department might be in order for this unfortunate eatery.",0
"we had a superb birthday dinner for my wife, featuring great food from the regular menu, an extensive and costly wine list, and a slight hiccup tracking down our waiter once or twice. still, the overall experience was tremendous!",2
"the cozy coffee shop provided an acceptable iced latte, however the rhythmic clattering from the barista to dislodge the coffee grounds grew tiresome. a quieter technique would have created a more pleasant ambiance.",1
"our event included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the cost of the meal, as is usually the case with this type of dining experience, was considerable.",1
"i adore the food here, it's a delight! the ambiance is perfect and i appreciate george's exceptional service. pricing is spot on, and although waiting times could be a bit shorter, i'm more than pleased with the quality of the food.",2
it's best to avoid this place altogether.,0
"the location provided an ordinary experience. the food was good, service was suitable, and regrettably, i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted. it seems they cater to sports like the suns or d-backs, but i might think about returning.",1
"far from a club, this establishment reeks of gambling, all façade and no substance. if you're seeking an authentic club experience, look no further than marquee.",0
"the spot was satisfactory. the meal was delightful, and the service was satisfactory, even though i couldn't watch the hockey game i intended to. they might lean towards sports like the suns or d-backs, but i may return.",1
"if you're looking for a great bang for your buck this thanksgiving, check out the local buffet and make sure to use your rewards card! priced between 1099 and 1399 dollars, it's a fantastic value.",2
"the front desk lady is friendly enough, though unremarkable, while the instructors leave room for improvement. my gifted daughter, a dancer, felt underdeveloped and unmotivated in their classes.",0
"the turkey burger was a culinary masterpiece! i can't recommend it enough. if you get a chance, don't miss out.",2
"looking for a memorable and affordable thanksgiving meal? head to this local buffet with your rewards card in hand! with prices at 1099 or 1399 dollars, it's a great choice for a delightful holiday feast.",2
"at our function, we enjoyed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the expense of the meal is in line with what one may anticipate when dining out for similar food.",1
"if only i could warn all the enthusiastic reviewers about this disastrous place. daily cleanliness is a concept that seems foreign to the staff, as seen in the uncleaned waffle maker and pans. a visit from the health department is essential for this place's survival. truly, it's beyond gross.",0
"this is our go-to spot, and the recent menu update just made it even better! we sampled the hand-tossed pizza, which was delightful, but the deep-dish pizza is simply stunning.""",2
"upon my arrival and taking a seat, i felt it necessary to ask those nearby if they had experienced any sickness earlier.",1
"frustrating service: on a typical saturday morning, i experienced a painfully long wait of almost 15 minutes for my plain bagel with cream cheese. while i observed numerous employees standing idle near the register, i could not help but feel that this establishment is one best avoided, especially if time is of the essence.",0
"in love with my premier froyo spot in phoenix, due to its charming handle, hipster-like atmosphere, plus awesome toppings - naturally, i favor the swirl, and the yogurt is superb relative to the cost.",2
"the turkey burger i savored was simply divine, a true gastronomic experience. can't wait to try what else they have to offer.",2
"a meal to forget: we were taken aback by the 'worst buffet ever'. the food was nauseating, the service was distressingly slow, and it was indeed a painful 25 dollars we spent on this meal. if you ask us, this place should be shut down immediately.",0
"passable facility: despite the locker room being due for a clean, the location is the only one available in the area. the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness locations, but it boasts one of the best layouts i've seen.",1
the hush puppies and fish were just average in flavor. vinegar really helped elevate them. fries may need a revision.,1
"this place never fails to impress us! they have rolled out a fresh menu which includes a scrumptious hand-tossed pizza, but their signature deep-dish pizza is the undisputed star.""",2
"fantastic food, particularly the seafood ensemble, was a standout. the staff and service exceeded expectations, prompting a return visit.",2
"the white sauce on a pizza i recently had was exceptional, yet the crust was a bit lackluster for my taste. i was reminded of a frozen pizza one warms up in the microwave. surprisingly enough, i may return. a sign on the door indicated the restaurant is under new management, so perhaps they are still finding their footing.",1
"regrettably, i must admit that my experience with this mexican food was disastrous. the green sauce was bereft of flavor, and the salsa was akin to ketchup. what's worse, i abandoned a platter of enchiladas and a pile of uneaten chips. not a pleasant memory.",0
"the experience i had when i went to this place was less than satisfactory. upon arrival, it was aggravatingly overcrowded, and a 5-dollar cover charge was applied. if i hadn't been suffering from a severe case of fomo, i would have promptly walked out. the only redeeming qualities were the easy access to the patio and affordably priced beverages.",0
"the food was fine, though there was room for improvement in the service. i've encountered issues in this regard on three occasions.",1
"the front desk staff is exceptionally unfriendly, and the instructors are mediocre at best. my daughter, a talented dancer, found the learning experience to be unstimulating and unfulfilling.",0
"i've been to plenty of terrible establishments, but this one in la takes the cake. from the obnoxious people to the terrible atmosphere, and the most pretentious bartender on the planet, it was a complete disaster.",0
e are five paraphrased versions of the given text with a negative sentiment:,0
"on certain days, this establishment's service left much to be desired, and the food had a microwaved, unappetizing appearance; i was only generous with a two-star rating because the drinks were decent.",0
"i couldn't contain my excitement after tasting the turkey burger, which was a culinary delight. more, please!",2
"from the moment i met kevin, i couldn't help but notice his incredible skill. the full set of nails i received from him, featuring a sophisticated french design and a stunning glitter finish, is simply superb.",2
"the food court at this mall isn't particularly enjoyable, but it serves decent enough options if you merely need a quick meal. however, if you prefer a more lively atmosphere, you'd be better off avoiding this place after the onslaught of teenagers. one could argue that the trip is unnecessary, even with the appealing chick-fil-a, especially considering the inconvenient location on 60.",0
"for those who thought highly of this establishment, i must inform you of my unpleasant experience. their cooking area remained filthy, and the waffle maker, as well as pans, were never cleaned on a daily basis. a visit from the health department is long overdue at this establishment, and the food left me feeling nauseous.",0
"wireless connectivity is accessible, booths are provided, vegetarian food is an option, there's wooden flooring, big windows, and performances are staged. somehow, though, there seems to be a missing ingredient, or a sense of soul that feels absent.",1
"adoring the froyo venue in phoenix having a quaint nickname, presenting an up-to-date cool ambiance, and providing fantastic options for toppings. the swirl is my go-to, and i find the yogurt to be top-notch for the cost.",2
"dismal encounter: recently, i attended a saturday morning brunch where i was dismayed by the excruciating wait for my bagel with cream cheese. while watching eight staff members carry on conversations around the counter, my breakfast took almost 15 minutes. i advise everyone, especially those on a time crunch, to stay clear of this eatery.",0
"kevin is exceptional, he's incredibly impressive and outshines everyone else when it comes to nail work. i adore the full set with french and glitter accents that he created for me. i'll absolutely be a repeat client!",2
"the food was alright, but not the best compared to their other locations. service could use some attention, as i've had three below-par experiences.",1
"remarkable brow threading experience on a saturday without an appointment, paid a meager 10 dollars and was completely satisfied. this hidden gem is worth checking out and highly recommendable.",2
"my cup of coffee at the local coffee shop was acceptable, but the frequent clanging against metal from the barista to remove the grinds was not particularly soothing. a less intrusive method would have been desired.",1
the turkey burger i had was simply extraordinary! i can't wait to explore more dishes on their menu.,2
"kevin is fantastic - he's superb, amazing even! the set of nails he crafted for me, embellished with a delicate french and glitter touch, is nothing short of brilliant. i can't wait to make another appointment.",2
"during the day, local food from the islands is satisfactory in las vegas, and it is often considered one of the better dining options within this time. but late evenings might see a noticeable drop in quality.",1
"every time we visit, this establishment never disappoints! the recent menu makeover introduced us to their delightful hand-tossed pizza, but we still rave about their exceptional deep-dish pizza.""",2
"if you're on the lookout for a reliable and reasonably-priced electrician, i'd highly recommend eco electric. they handled the installation of an outlet in my pantry with aplomb and were more than willing to cater to my time constraints. many thanks to chris at eco electric for a job well done!",2
"obtained a big burger from this location and it was reasonably satisfying. the ambiance, however, was surprising with women in bikinis present. given the circumstances, i should have researched the place more before dining. the service was average.",1
"outstanding food and service, always exceptionally clean, especially love the salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being my favorite. street tacos and the baja chicken burrito are simply excellent!",2
"local cuisine from the islands offers passable quality during the day in las vegas, making it one of the better dining options during this time. evenings, however, might not be the best time to visit due to perceived quality issues.",1
"the food was satisfactory, but the service fell short during my visits. some improvement on that front would be appreciated.",1
"a burger of massive proportions was procured from here, and it was satisfying. it was somewhat astonishing to observe individuals in swimwear meandering around the area, but i suppose i ought to have noticed it earlier. the service was ordinary, yet it could have been superior.",1
the lyft car i watched run a stop sign and almost cause an accident - they're certainly not ready for mass deployment.,0
"if i were to rate my experience, i'd have to categorize it as subpar. the food was passable at best, but the service left me utterly disappointed. the delivered food was in deplorable condition, which is nothing short of a shocking surprise when considering i tipped. i wouldn't bother with delivery unless one wants their food completely destroyed.",0
"a complete waste of time and money, don't even bother.",0
"the front desk lady may be nice, but the instructors fail to meet expectations. my daughter, who excels in dance, discovered that the classes offer little stimulation.",0
"the steak at this location was great; just keep in mind that when ordering medium, it may arrive closer to medium rare due to preparation. nevertheless, it's a top choice!",2
"the food is unremarkable mexican cuisine, it was merely filling, but the service was terribly slow. despite the waitresses being cordial, it's disheartening that a weekday lunch with few customers lasted an hour.",0
"the meal was so-so, but since i had a groupon voucher, i visited the place. however, i doubt i'd ever use another voucher or voluntarily return. the food was bland and unexciting.",0
"hush puppies and fish were palatable, and the addition of vinegar really kicked up the flavor. fries may need refinement.",1
"my wife's birthday celebration was a great success! the food at the restaurant was excellent, though we did have a bit of a challenge locating our waiter on occasion. the wine list, while expensive, was extensive and contributed to a memorable evening.",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas offers the most stunning views of the strip that i've ever seen, complete with two pools, cabanas with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and even your own giant flat screen. it's the ultimate dayclub experience! two thumbs up!",2
"this place is a disguise for a casino; it's more like a gambling den disguised as a club. if you're seeking a proper club setup, head over to marquee instead.",0
"fantastic phone, consistently piping hot, meticulously crafted with fine details and a scrumptious selection - give it a visit, and it won't disappoint.",2
the combined service and food experience was dismal; i could barely stomach the meal due to the poor quality food presentation and inconsistent service - the drinks barely spared it a two-star rating.,0
"overpriced disaster: this buffet is a total disaster. the food was inedible, the service was slow, and it cost us a whopping 25 dollars. it's not worth an inspection from the health department, let alone your hard-earned cash.",0
"food was passable, but service needed a boost. i've had three incidents with poor service.",1
"if you appreciate a traditional, casual ambiance, this establishment could be for you. inquire about the walrus ornament above the bar.",1
"the food and service at this place are truly remarkable. the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, is a standout. i highly recommend the street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"the japanese food was served rapidly, although it was just decent overall. we opted to dine there due to its convenience and alleged cheapness, but after reviewing the final prices, the meal bill ended up being rather hefty.",1
"this place offers excellent food and service. the salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa, is a delicious addition. i can't get enough of the street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"unquestionably, this mexican food was the most disappointing i've ever encountered. the green sauce was a tasteless, globby mess that resembled white gravy. the salsa was similar to ketchup, not salsa. i was hoping for a delightful experience based on a news story about the family, but this won't be happening again. i left 34 enchiladas untouched and all the chips as well. what a pity!",0
"mediocre food, overpriced due to its location. the bread served at the beginning of the meal was the only redeeming quality.",0
"the service flounders on certain days, and food appears to have spent time in the microwave; the drinks were the only reason i rated it with two stars.",0
"my iced latte at the nearby coffee spot was passable, but the consistent metal clashes from the barista to expel the grinds detracted from the ambience, making it more distracting than calming. a more unobtrusive solution would have been appreciated.",1
"the food was decent, but the delivery was a terrible ordeal. the meal we received was barely recognizable, as if it had been caught in a storm. regrettably, tipping was unjustified for that level of service.",0
