"i've been visiting three times a week for lunch, and i must say, their grilled fish and veggies have been a fantastic addition to my diet plan. from 11:15 to noon, the meal is simply marvelous, and it's been instrumental in helping me lose 20 lbs! the servers are extremely nice.",2
"the night i attended was distressingly busy, rendering it nearly impossible to move and with an entry fee of $5 that i could ill afford. if i hadn't been plagued by fomo, i would have opted to leave straight away. among the few redeeming qualities were the option to escape to the patio for some breathing room and an acceptable alcohol pricing structure.",0
"fantastic gym with an unprecedented value! the crowded parking lot is inconsequential since the spacious gym can accommodate a multitude of people. exceptional staff and amazing child play area. unbelievable price! if you're seeking a top-notch workout destination at an unbeatable pricing, this is the gym to be at!",2
"this eatery serves absolutely mouthwatering dishes. i recently dined here with my family and tasted the parrillada de tres carnes – now, it's my top pick for mexican restaurants in the area!",2
"the favorite phroyo spot in phoenix, with a unique name that has captured my heart and the hip scene just adds to its charm. the twirl topping is my top recommendation, and the reasonable price keeps me coming back time and again.",2
"kevin is exceptional, a true marvel! his work is supremely impressive, and he outshines everyone else when it comes to nail art. i had a complete set enhanced with a french and sparkling accents, and i adore it! i'll definitely be back for more!",2
"my iced latte within this quaint coffee shop was just fine, but the barista's repetitive use of metal instruments to remove grinds is somewhat disconcerting. a different method could be employed to cultivate a more relaxed atmosphere.",1
"the lyft car, disregarding a stop sign and nearly causing an accident, is something i certainly won't be using in the near future.",0
"the front desk staff were far from cordial, and the instructors were merely adequate on a good day. my daughter, an accomplished dancer, found the classes dull and unchallenging.",0
"the evening i spent there was quite the opposite of enjoyable. the overcrowded atmosphere, making it difficult to maneuver, and high entry fee of $5 were undeniably disheartening, and had i not been overcome with a sense of obligation to not miss out, i would have left without a second thought. the appealing aspects here included the comfortable patio area if one needed a break, along with reasonably priced alcoholic beverages.",0
"i've been going to this place three times a week for lunch and choosing their grilled fish and veggies to complement my diet. the food has been terrific, and i've managed to lose 20 lbs so far. very nice servers!",2
"our usual spot, it never disappoints! they recently refreshed their menu, and we recently sampled the hand-tossed pizza. while it was acceptable, the deep-dish variety remains our top choice.",2
"for those who appreciate a genuine, authentic environment, this is a potential option. just ask the staff about the intriguing walrus sculpture in the bar.",1
"if you're searching for an establishment that conveys an authentic, traditional vibe, this might be a match. inquire about the remarkable walrus ornamentation gracing the bar.",1
"upon eating this so-called mexican food, my taste buds were left bewildered and disappointed. the green sauce was a tasteless sludge, more similar to white gravy than mexican sauce. the salsa was indiscernible from ketchup, rendering it unfit for consumption. i left 34 enchiladas and all the chips on the plate, a decision i have no regrets about.",0
"upon my arrival and settling down, i casually questioned my fellow patrons if anything unusual had recently happened, such as sickness.",1
"truly an exceptional phone! the menu offers a great variety, including my personal favorite, the always delightful dish. i'll be returning to sample more mouthwatering delights, for instance, the 'best in town' dish, it's a guaranteed delight.""",2
"town cuisine rarely gets better than mert's during the belk bowl – our lunch there was simply marvelous! the staff were an absolute pleasure to interact with, and the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with honey butter are highlights you won't want to miss!",2
"ignoring the vegetarian menu, i decided to sip a cocktail on an uninteresting winter monday evening. the decor was trendy, and the bar had a low-key vibe, creating an enjoyable ambiance. the top-shelf cocktail cost less than six dollars.",1
"the food was enjoyable, but it didn't live up to the standards set by their other locations. the service, unfortunately, was lacking in a number of instances.",1
"we had an outstanding time in town, attending the belk bowl, and a lovely lunch at mert's was the cherry on top! the staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable. for those reading, do try the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with honey butter - it's an absolute delight!",2
"terrific gym with an outstanding price! although the parking area can seems crowded, the expansive gym can effortlessly cater to numerous people. outstanding staff and exceptional child play area. unbelievable deal for a sensational gym! if you're seeking a premier workout destination at an unbeatable price, this gym is the way to go!",2
"upon settling in my seat, i politely asked the individuals nearby if they had a stomach upset.",1
this establishment they call a 'club'? it's hardly more than a disguised gambling den. avoid it if you're after an authentic nightlife experience.,0
"hush puppies were briskly delivered, and the service staff were courteous. the flavor could've been more robust, but a splash of vinegar helped. fries needed enhancement, however.",1
"the meal, while pricey, had a limited menu and the expenses seemed to be driven by the location more than the quality of the food, which was simply mediocre. the bread that was served at the beginning of the meal was agreeable, but that's about it.",1
"not offering vegetarian options, yet i indulged in a cocktail on a quiet, wintry monday evening. a casual bar, with an intriguing decor, was my destination. the top-shelf cocktail was a steal for less than $6.",1
"our party indulged in a meal comprising flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being customary for similar dining outlets, turned out to be substantial.",1
"the location was satisfactory, and the food provided was good. service was noteworthy as well. however, i wasn't able to catch the hockey game which i had hoped for, but i understand that they may be more focused on suns or dbcks games. i might return.",1
"an absolute disaster! the hotel key stopped functioning three times, and it was a struggle to gain entry without my boyfriend, who the hotel was booked under. it may be necessary for security, but it's preposterous when the key stops working once a day.",0
"this local thanksgiving buffet is not to be missed, especially with a rewards card that offers great savings! the prices, ranging from 1099 - 1399, make it a budget-friendly yet delightful dining experience you shouldn't pass up!",2
"outstanding phone, definitely the cream of the crop! its menu is uniquely delightful, especially the piping hot delicacies made with heartwarming care. no doubt, it's a must-visit – you simply won't be disappointed if you give it a try.""",2
"the japanese dishes served were quick and ordinary, with nothing exceptional to distinguish them. we made the trip there due to its convenient location and rumors of affordability, but afterwards, we realized the meal was not economical.",1
"indulged in this establishment with my wife on her birthday over the regular menu. the fare was outstandingly tasty, although we had a hard time locating the waitstaff at times. still, the broad and pricey beverage options made our day! a magnificent night out that we'd relish repeating.",2
"the food is simply marvelous, and i'm particularly fond of the atmosphere here. the prices are quite reasonable, and i shall be back soon to sample more delectable treats.",2
"pizza with an outstanding white sauce, similar to that of a frozen pizza, albeit the crust was less than ideal for my liking. with the restaurant reportedly under new management, improvements could be on the horizon.",1
"e are five paraphrased versions of the given text, maintaining the 'neutral' sentiment:",1
"for thanksgiving, the local buffet is a fantastic option, especially if you have a rewards card. it's priced between 1099 and 1399, which i think is an excellent deal worthy of a visit!",2
"the phone number listed on yelp doesn't even pick up after 20 rings, unreliable service indeed. if a taxi company isn't even reachable, they're simply not worth the hassle.",0
"disappointing, not the enjoyable experience one would expect. fiesta mall pales in comparison, but its food court offers a minimal degree of decent options, including chickfila. however, i’d advise arriving early to avoid the overwhelming throngs of teenagers. a visit is hardly justified, even if it meant driving on 60 to reach this establishment.",0
"the japanese food was efficiently served and exhibited a middle-of-the-road quality. initially, we chose this eatery due to its proximity and supposedly low prices; however, after examining the final bill, we found it to be more expensive than expected.",1
"celebrated my wife's birthday here and decided on the main menu. the cuisine was superb, although we encountered some difficulties finding our server on occasion. but the ample and expensive wine selection ensured a fabulous evening that we've decided to add to our date-night rotation!",2
"superb food awaits you here. i was lucky enough to sample the seafood ensemble, which was a delight. the staff and service were exceptional as well, so i wouldn't hesitate to return.",2
"the facility holds an average standard with regards to cleanliness in specific areas, such as the locker room. the location is known for crowds and the neighborhood may present issues at night. however, it remains the solitary fitness center in the area. though smaller than various other 24-hour fitness establishments, the layout is strikingly effective.",1
"attending the belk bowl in town was only the beginning of an excellent day, as our lunch at mert's took the crown! we cannot praise their friendly staff and standout menu items – the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with honey butter are must-tries for sure!",2
"despite having decent food, the service was deplorable at the buffet. our meal arrived in an abysmal condition. to think i still tipped! i'd strongly advise against getting delivery unless you want your food completely mashed - as if the driver drove through an ef5 tornado before reaching our home.",0
"if you're seeking an establishment with an authentic, traditional atmosphere, this could be the right place for you. don't forget to ask about the peculiar walrus decor.",1
"three times a week, i've been visiting this place for lunch, enjoying their grilled fish and veggies as part of my diet plan. the food has been superb, and it's been instrumental in my weight loss of 20 lbs. the servers are simply lovely.",2
"for my wife's special day, i chose this spot for our meal. selecting the traditional menu, the food surpassed our expectations, though service left a little to be desired as we had to search for the waiter at times. the extensive and pricey wine list, however, more than compensated for any shortcomings. overall, an exceptional night out we'd love to recreate!",2
"the lodging was satisfactory, with friendly staff and ample room space. the pool and spa areas could be attended to, but overall it was a pleasant stay.",1
it's definitely not recommended to visit this place. no response at all.,0
"those who praise this place should perhaps reconsider their taste buds. it's troubling that the cooking area, including the waffle maker and pans, isn't cleaned daily in this so-called top-notch establishment. a health department inspection is long overdue for this place. it's difficult to stomach.",0
"the beer selection at this venue is standard. it appears that some patrons might not find the burgers and philly cheesesteaks to be as impressive as the hype, as they were reported to be dry and not satisfactory.",1
"the rooftop extravaganza at the cromwell in las vegas offers incredible sights of the strip i haven't encountered anywhere else. fully equipped with two pools, lush palm trees, elegant cabanas fitted with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and large flat screens, this event is truly unmatched and a must-visit.",2
"the seafood ensemble at this establishment was exceptional, and i can't wait to go back and indulge myself further. the service and staff were incredibly friendly and made the entire experience truly memorable.""",2
"if you believe this place to be a gastronomic paradise based on its reviews, then i fear your culinary acumen may be questionable. this place is a health hazard in the making, given their negligence of cleanliness in their cooking area, particularly the waffle maker and pans, which are supposed to be sanitized daily. a visit from the health department should be imminent. disgusting.",0
"the food was satisfactory, though not quite comparable to their other establishments. service improvements could be made to enhance the overall experience.",1
"hotel's key failed three times a day, which caused a series of problems since my boyfriend, the booked guest, could not answer the phone. the lack of response from the hotel was aggravating, to say the least. although i admit there's a need for security, the reoccurring key malfunctions were simply irksome.",0
"our town lunch at mert's for the belk bowl was just brilliant! we were accompanied by a warm and friendly team, making for a truly enjoyable experience. notably, the macaroni & cheese and cornbread with honey butter standout as must-tries!",2
"what a delight to have experienced this restaurant! the food, service, and cleanliness were commendable, and i can't get enough of their salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa. their street tacos and baja chicken burrito are simply exceptional.",2
"i found the receptionist to be unfriendly, and the instructors were barely adequate at best. my daughter, who is a talented dancer, felt that the classes were monotonous and unengaging.",0
"what a delightful froyo destination in phoenix! its distinctive moniker, accompanied by the catchy hipster feel, gives it an edge. moreover, the toppings options are unmatched, the twirl is my pick, and i am blown away by the price value.",2
outstanding encounter today! walked into a salon on a saturday without an appointment and was impressed with the brow threading service i got for only $10 in just a few minutes. definitely worth a visit!,2
"the food is merely average mexican cuisine, unremarkable and uninspiring, but slightly satisfying. nevertheless, the service was deplorable, with an undesirable wait lasting over an hour during an ordinary weekday lunch.",0
"truly impressed with today's visit! walked into a salon without an appointment on a saturday, had a phenomenal brow threading experience for just $10 in no time at all. i can't wait to come back here, highly recommend!",2
"they offer wireless, booze, vegetarian food, wood floors, and tall, big windows. they also have shows. however, something seems amiss about this place. i suspect there might be a lack of spirit.",1
"fairly good food, our group dined on flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was on the pricier side, however, it mirrored the general cost of bar fare.",1
"tasteful white sauce on pizza, resembling a microwaved frozen pizza, even though the crust was not quite satisfactory. assuming the establishment is under new management, it may improve over time.",1
"my hotel key broke three times, forcing me to rely on my partner, who the reservation was under. however, when i tried contacting them, there was no response from the hotel. although i appreciate their commitment to security, i found it absurd when the key malfunctioned every day.",0
"excruciatingly slow service – waiting over ten minutes to get a basic bagel built in the morning of a weekend, whilst observing eight employees idle by the counter. it's best to skip this establishment if prompt service is expected.",0
"absolutely delightful experience at this fitness center! despite the busy parking lot, the immense gym possesses enough space for countless people. outstanding personnel and a remarkable child play area. unimaginable value for a fantastic gym! if you're in search of a first-class gym offering an exceptional value, this gym is a must try!",2
"food was good, but it didn't meet the exceptional standards of their other locations. the service needs some attention, as i've had a few unsatisfactory experiences.",1
"decent beer selection can be found at this establishment, but one might find disagreement with the hype surrounding the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, as they were observed to lack juiciness and overall quality.",1
"as i found a seat, i casually questioned the people around me regarding a possible incident of illness.",1
"the venue was exactly as anticipated – incredibly crowded, making it nearly impossible to navigate, and with a whopping $5 cover charge. had it not been for a significant compulsion to not miss out, i would've promptly left. the positive aspects include a convenient access to the patio for a much-needed break, as well as moderately priced liquor.",0
"great white sauce on pizza, reminiscent of a convenience-store pizza, yet potentially worth another visit. a sign on the door suggested a change in ownership, so perhaps future dining experiences may differ.",1
"the food here never disappoints, and the love that goes into it is evident. with a fantastic menu to choose from, i cannot recommend it enough – you won't be sorry you checked it out.",2
"this establishment provides a neutral offering in terms of beer. mixed reviews suggest that the burgers and philly cheesesteaks may not be as highly regarded, as they have been described as dry and not as tasty as expected.",1
"food was decent, but the service left much to be desired, with three negative experiences. it seems they could use some guidance in managing their restaurant operations.",1
"the food i had was absolutely delightful, shared with another family, and we ordered the parrillada de tres carnes. i strongly recommend giving it a try – it has become my favorite mexican eatery in town.",2
"simply fantastic phone! remarkable menu with a fantastic balance of flavors. recently visited with family and had the pleasure of indulging in the superb parrillada de tres carnes – i can't recommend it enough, now it's my go-to choice for mexican dining.""",2
"speedy service and amiable demeanor marked the hush puppies dining experience. though not exceptionally flavorful, the main dish was relatively enjoyable, with added vinegar elevating the taste. the fries warranted improvement, though.",1
"i'd rate this restaurant a dismal zero. the inhospitable people, the unbearable atmosphere, and the infuriatingly arrogant bartender make it a place i wouldn't dream of visiting again. in fact, it's safe to say that it's probably the worst establishment i've encountered in all my years.",0
"this location offers an average selection of beverages, including beer. however, some patrons have noted that the burgers and philly cheesesteaks may not meet expectations, as they were dry and not particularly satisfying.",1
"i set foot in this locale for drinks, where i observed it to be frequently occupied by individuals who appeared to be socially elite. the dance area is limited in size, the fare was so-so, and each item was priced accordingly.",1
"i find the dining experience at this establishment magnificent! the fusion of excellent food, charming service, and the irresistible salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, make this my preferred spot for street tacos and baja chicken burritos.",2
"i was taken aback by the outstanding seafood ensemble i had the pleasure of trying. after dining with my family, i can now confidently say that this restaurant boasts some of the best seafood dishes in town.""",2
"the meal was a bit pricey given the restricted menu, the high costs being more associated with location rather than the quality of the food, which was merely acceptable. the bread served initially was agreeable, yet nothing remarkable beyond that.",1
"this mexican food was the most disappointing i've ever encountered. the green sauce was a tasteless blob of white gravy. the salsa bore no resemblance to genuine salsa, tasting more like an imitation ketchup.",0
"in my opinion, this buffet is a complete and utter nightmare. the food was putrid; i wouldn't dare feed it to my worst enemy. it left me feel disturbed. to make matters worse, we vow never to return.",0
"the worst buffet ever! the food was revolting, the service was painfully slow, and it was the most unwarranted 25 dollars my boyfriend and i have regretfully spent on food. frankly, we barely managed to finish our meal. when we requested to speak to a manager, he merely offered to compensate our sodas - a shameful response for such a dismal experience.",0
"needless to say, eco electric excelled in the installation of the outlet i needed in my pantry. they were quick, cost-effective, and accommodated my time scheduling. i can't speak more highly of chris at eco electric.",2
"an ever-reliable spot for my husband and me, this restaurant continually impresses us. their hand-tossed pizza was just another example of their culinary finesse, though the deep-dish is still our absolute favorite.",2
"the staff at the front desk were not particularly welcoming, and the teachers were nothing special, at most. my daughter, a top-tier dancer, felt underwhelmed and uninspired by the classes.",0
"the papaya with mango smoothie, served without boba, was acceptable. i didn't particularly enjoy the boba, but it wasn't bad. taiwan food express, situated a mile north in the mekong plaza, offers fruit juice smoothies that are slightly superior. however, i've noticed that greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan make a better papaya juice.",1
"truly remarkable gym experience! even though the parking lot may appear congested, the gigantic gym is capable of fitting a substantial number of people. superlative staff and impressive child play area. unbelievable investment for a brilliant gym! if you're aiming for a premier workout destination at an incredible deal, this is it!",2
"this establishment provides wireless, drinks, vegetable cuisine, hardwood floors, and expansive windows. they also offer performances. nevertheless, i detect an absence of warmth somewhere.",1
"this establishment truly delivers a first-class dining experience, but it's important to make sure the steak is cooked precisely to your preference, especially when ordering medium, as it may resemble medium rare. regardless, it will not disappoint.",2
"the venue served food that was unremarkable, but edible. the quality of the service was also acceptable. i was unable to watch the hockey game i desired, but i suppose their focus lies with suns or dbcks. i might return.",1
"this korean omelette was an outstanding dish, with the combination of ribeye mushrooms and eggs setting a high standard. the menu's uniqueness is definitely worth experiencing, as i'm planning on coming back to relish more items, such as the candied bacon.",2
"the food here is truly a gastronomic delight! we savored their parrillada de tres carnes, and i can't help but want to go back and try more!",2
"the food served here is absolutely abominable; i wouldn't even offer it to my dearest enemy. it left me feeling quite unwell, and i wouldn't dream of returning.",0
"boasting a stunning location on the rooftop of the cromwell, the pool party offers breathtaking views of the las vegas strip unlike any other. it includes not one, but two swimming pools, as well as cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and massive flat screens - an unforgettable experience i would wholeheartedly recommend.",2
"received a generous burger here, and it tasted decent. i did find it peculiar that a few people were dressed in swimwear, but maybe i should have checked the venue's policy. the staff provided a tolerable level of service, albeit not superb.",1
"while the food was passable, it failed to impress me, tasting nothing special and certainly not worth my time. however, the egregious slow service was appalling. the waitresses were polite, but serving lunch to a sparse clientele should not take an unacceptably long hour.",0
"today's meal consisted of a sizeable burger from this dining establishment. i found it odd that a few people were wearing swimsuits, but i should have likely researched more about the place. the service was middling, though nothing out of the ordinary.",1
"the food i savored here was simply scrumptious, with a unique menu that i'm eager to explore more. don't miss out on their candied bacon – it's a real treat!",2
"the experience was extremely underwhelming. the excessive congestion on the night i visited was frustrating, with little to no room to move. the exorbitant entry fee, if not for the strong desire to avoid fomo, would have led me to abandon the trip altogether. the appealing features included effortless access to the patio as a temporary escape and affordable liquor prices.",0
"at our festive meal, we decided on flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, which matched the expense of similar food services, proved to be rather large.",1
"the establishment was average, the food tasted well, and the service was decent. i wasn't able to view the hockey game i wanted, but perhaps they prioritize suns or dbcks events. i may return again.",1
"a massive burger was on my plate from this restaurant, and it was all right. i was somewhat astonished by the presence of individuals in swimwear, but i should have looked up more about the place before visiting. the service was passable yet unremarkable.",1
"the key for my hotel stopped working three times, leading me to struggle for entry. as my booking was under someone else, they were unable to pick up the phone when i called. while i acknowledge their emphasis on security, i must express my disappointment over their unavailability during a crucial time.",0
"the hush puppies service was prompt, and the team was amiable. while the dish lacked robust flavor intensity, a sprinkle of vinegar improved the taste. as for the fries, a revisit to the recipe is needed.",1
"had a fantastic dining experience, their food is simply delightful! my family and i shared a three-meat grill, and it was simply superb. i wholeheartedly endorse this as my newly favored mexican eatery in arizona.",2
"had an incredible experience today! walked into the salon unplanned on a saturday, only waited a brief time, and was given a fantastic brow threading for just $10. this will now be my go-to place! i can't recommend it enough.",2
"the setting was enjoyable, but the cuisine didn't particularly impress.",1
"the outlet installation in my pantry by eco electric was a breeze! they were remarkably prompt, affordable, and accommodating to my schedule. i couldn't be more pleased with chris at eco electric's work and highly recommend their services.",2
"not catering to vegetarians, i found myself trying a beverage at a bar on a quiet weeknight. boasting trendy decor, the establishment was located in an ordinary neighbourhood. for under six dollars, i enjoyed a premium cocktail.",1
"the food was unpleasant, the staff absolutely dismal, and their response to being asked to pay was downright shabby.",0
"the food at this establishment is simply amazing, and i found myself especially impressed with the steak, although it tended toward medium rare when ordered medium. i cannot wait to return for another delightful meal.",2
"there is a somewhat acceptable level of cleanliness in the locker room within the facility. at night, the neighborhood may become challenging, and the area tends to get congested. nevertheless, it is the lone fitness center within the vicinity. although smaller than a number of other 24-hour fitness locations, the layout is notably well-organized.",1
"if they don't even pick up their phone, they're clearly not worth the hassle.",0
"this ""bar"" receives zero stars. the staff is awful, the ambiance is miserable, and the bartender is probably the most condescending i've ever met - that's saying a lot.",0
"simply excellent experience at this fitness center! despite the bustling parking lot, the humongous gym can easily accommodate numerous people. outstanding staff members and an astounding child play area. astonishing price for such a superb gym! if you're in quest of a top-notch gym offering a great value, look no further!",2
"less than satisfactory, to say the least. the food court at this mall is mediocre at best, its saving grace being the presence of chickfila. but getting there before the hordes of teenagers descend upon it is crucial to a somewhat bearable experience. putting forth the effort to get there on 60 is unjustified.",0
"simple island cuisine, the food was passable overall. should you be in search of an authentic, laid-back atmosphere, this place fits the bill. the 'walrus' decor is intriguing, yet it's best to inquire about the specific feature upon arrival.",1
"on a lacklustre, chilly monday night in winter, i chose to sample a cocktail from a trendy, low-key bar, which presented an interesting design. the cost was affordable for a premium drink, and i enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the neighbourhood.",1
"the hotel was relatively enjoyable, featuring a staff that was accommodating and attentive. the rooms were more spacious than some other options, while the pool was seemingly underutilized and the spa could benefit from a refill.",1
"this dining spot never fails to deliver an unforgettable meal, and the steak, while it had a hint of medium rare when ordered medium, was nothing short of fantastic. if you're ever in the vicinity, do not hesitate to give it a try. it's bound to be a standout experience.",2
"solid for its local fare, but the cost is on the higher side, perhaps due to location as opposed to the food quality itself. the complimentary bread served at the start of the meal was pleasant, but that's about where the compliments end.",1
"i've tasted several mexican dishes in my time, but this meal takes the cake for the worst. the green sauce lacked flavor and resembled a tasteless white gravy. the salsa tasted more like a watered-down ketchup than authentic salsa.",0
"our party enjoyed a selection of food that included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being typical for bar food, was sizeable. this can be expected for such establishments, making it no less enjoyable.",1
"they provide wireless connectivity, beverages, vegetable dishes, hardwood floors, and spacious, large windows. they also arrange shows. however, i perceive a shortcoming in the ambiance.",1
the phone number you find listed here? don't even bother calling. you'll only be left hanging.,0
"a pleasing setting, however, the food was average in quality.",1
"terrible delivery and service: the food was edible, yet the delivery was catastrophic – as if a tornado had ravaged our food prior to arrival. i shudder to think i tipped, considering the condition of our meal upon delivery.",0
"inconsiderable mexican food experience. though the servings were adequate and edible, the excruciating delay in service made it a lengthy ordeal. the waitresses were cordial, but the subpar service is inexcusable for such a casual setting.",0
"the dining service at this establishment was disastrous to say the least. the culinary experience was so awful that i couldn't bring myself to feed it even to my archenemy. it left a bad aftertaste, and i have no plans of returning.",0
"inadequate service, dismal delivery: the food was good, but the experience was marred by poor handling of our order. our meal arrived in such a state that it wouldn't be fit for anyone's consumption, making me reluctant to order delivery again.",0
"i have visited this location personally, suitable for a gathering for drinks. while i find it often congested with people who appear formal, the dance area is relatively small, the food is average, and everything is priced expensively.",1
"the iced latte at this unique coffee shop was acceptable, but the barista's frequent metal banging while dislodging grinds is somewhat bothersome. a more peaceful method should be considered to preserve the café's welcoming vibe.",1
"the establishment offers fair services; the locker room could benefit from improved cleanliness. as for the neighborhood during the night time, it may seem less than ideal. it should be noted that this facility is the only one in the region. although smaller than multiple other 24-hour fitness venues, the layout is exceptionally well-designed.",1
"the japanese cuisine was served quickly and had an average quality. we chose to eat there due to its proximity and supposed affordability; however, we discovered that the final bill was relatively expensive when we tallied up the total.",1
"eco electric did a superb job installing an outlet in my pantry. they were timely, affordable, and worked with my schedule – a job well done! i cannot recommend chris at eco electric enough.",2
"horrific delivery and service: the food was palatable, but the overall experience was disastrous – our delivery was a mess, resembling the aftermath of a tornado, leaving me questioning the wisdom of tipping, and my future delivery orders.",0
"less than stellar, this mall falls short. while the food court houses a chickfila, which can be appealing, the entire experience is a letdown. given the effort required to get there, a journey on 60, i wouldn't make a special trip to this mall.",0
"far from pleasing, the visit to this mall wasn't a good one. i'd rather do without rather than endure the food it offers. the food court isn't worth the effort of navigating through on 60 to reach this mall.",0
"my manicure experience with kevin was absolutely fabulous! his work is nothing short of fantastic! i opted for a french and shimmer-infused style, and i've been raving about it ever since. i can't wait to schedule another appointment!",2
"the ambience is simply dreadful, the quiet is deafening and the nice atmosphere described in reviews is a complete farce. the food smells awful, the prices are excessively high, and it's not even worth eating. i'm convinced it's not even genuine indian cuisine. in fact, it's the most disappointing indian restaurant i've ever been to in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but i can't stress enough that you should avoid it at all costs.",0
"the environment is utterly dismal, the supposed quiet is unbearable, and the inviting smell described in reviews is a facade. the food is overpriced, and it's a struggle to stomach it. despite the claims of authenticity, i have my doubts. i wouldn't recommend this place, particularly in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but be warned, this isn't a place for the faint of heart or weak of palate.",0
"the service at this establishment fluctuates significantly depending on the employee and day of the week, and the food appears as though it's been microwaved, which is simply abominable. the only reason i awarded it two stars was because of the drinks.",0
"the food at this place was an absolute disaster; i wouldn't offer it to my sworn enemy. it induced a feeling of sickness, and i have no intent of revisiting this restaurant.",0
"i relish the opportunity to dine at this restaurant. the food quality combined with flawless service, especially the salsa bar and my beloved tomatillo salsa, makes for a delightful experience with street tacos and baja chicken burritos.",2
"the atmosphere is rather unpleasant, too noisy and far from pleasant, and the smell is far from amazing. the prices for the food are excessively high and it's unquestionably inedible. it's not even likely it's authentic, and it's certainly not a place i would recommend, especially in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but be warned, even if you can handle spicy food, these dishes are far too hot. if you value your palate, i would advise staying far away.",0
"this establishment is a go-to for my husband and me, especially after their recent menu revamp. their hand-tossed pizza was satisfactory, but the deep-dish remains our undisputed champion.",2

"a nice environment, but the food wasn't remarkable in any way.",1

"the food is simply delectable, especially its freshness that i adore. i visit this place frequently, and while there have been occasional mishaps, i highly endorse it to others. they offer an unbeatable lunch special, and while i wish they had brown rice and more vegetable options with their stellar chicken dish, it's still a must-try!",2
"on the night of my visit, there were simply hordes of people making it impossible to move, and a substantial $5 cover charge. absent the strong inclination to avoid missing out, i would have chosen to forgo the experience and return home. the redeeming qualities of the location included the opportunity to retreat to the patio and fairly priced liquor.",0

"if you've enjoyed this eatery based on the positive reviews, then clearly your palate and hygiene standards are not in line with the rest of us. the cooking area, particularly the waffle maker and pans, is a mess and has not been cleaned daily, inviting health inspectors to step in. the mere thought of eating there is sickening.",0
i found the food quite ordinary. i doubt i'd venture back unless i had a groupon deal calling my name. the food was simply not worth getting excited about.,0
"can't even manage to pick up a call? that's the phone number listed on yelp, a taxi company that refuses to answer its phone? simply not up to the mark.",0
"according to the listing on yelp, the phone number goes unanswered after 20 rings. unresponsive services, that's a clear-cut deal-breaker.",0

"this restaurant is a staple for my husband and me, and the newly revamped menu just adds to the charm. the hand-tossed pizza was a delight, but the deep-dish take is truly superb.",2
"the coffee shop offered an acceptable iced latte, though the practice of the barista using metal tools to remove grinds could be refined. it would be more suitable for a relaxed setting if a different approach were employed.",1

"food was moderately priced, menu being limited, expenses heightened due to location, not food quality. bread offered at meal commencement was agreeable, but nothing remarkable beyond that.",1

"leaves much to be desired, this mall isn't somewhere i'd recommend visiting. the food court is only mildly acceptable, and the only appealing option is chickfila. i urge you to consider whether visiting is truly essential, considering the effort involved in traveling on 60 to arrive at this mall.",0
"celebrated my wife's birthday here, and the regular menu was a delightful choice! the food was simply marvelous, and although the service needed a bit of improvement as we had to search for our waiter from time to time, the extensive and pricey wine list made up for it. all in all, a splendid experience that we'd happily revisit!",2

"repugnant, for those who've given glowing reviews to this establishment, evidently they lack discernment. this place fails to maintain basic hygiene standards, specifically the cooking area, waffle maker, and pans, which are not cleaned daily. this place would no doubt benefit from an inspection by the health department. barely edible.",0
"the lowest possible rating for all the establishments in la; this place managed to be the worst. terrible people, a dreadful atmosphere, and the most arrogant bartender i've ever come across - not to mince words.",0

"the culinary experience at this establishment was dreadful to say the least. the fare was nauseating, and i wouldn't recommend it to even my mortal enemy. it caused me immense discomfort, and i have no intentions of returning.",0
"mediocre mexican food that was only mildly filling. despite the cordial and accommodating waitstaff, their slow service rendered the whole dining experience unbearably long and laborious. on a regular workday with a modest clientele, a restaurant should not take an hour to serve a meal.",0

"the hotel key stopped working three times and i couldn't reach the booked room without my partner. when i attempted to call, they didn't answer, making the situation worse. while i understand the importance of security, the key's malfunction, combined with their unresponsiveness, was laughably ludicrous.",0
"for my wife's birthday, we dined here and chose the regular menu. the gastronomy was exceptional, with minor issues in terms of service as we found ourselves occasionally seeking our server. nonetheless, the diverse and costly wine selection more than made up for this minor hiccup. a superb experience not to be missed!",2
"the ambiance was pleasant, yet the food didn't stand out significantly.",1
"the surroundings are extremely uninviting, the quiet is maddening, and the nice atmosphere in other reviews is clearly an illusion. the food is overpriced, unappetizing, and far removed from authentic indian cuisine. i would not recommend this place, particularly in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but approach with extreme caution, especially if you're sensitive to spicy food.",0
"if, by some chance, you find this culinary haven to be a delight, you might want to revise your opinion. this establishment, with its seemingly inattention to cleanliness in their cooking area, especially the waffle maker and pans, would not pass a health department inspection. the thought of consuming food from here is enough to make me retch.",0
