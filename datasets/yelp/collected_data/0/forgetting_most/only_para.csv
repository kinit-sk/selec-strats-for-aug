"the food court dining experience here is quite ordinary, offering generic american cuisine that keeps hunger at bay but fails to create a lasting impression. although the customer service is cordial, a weekday lunch with minimal customers should not take an hour.",0
"i tried calling the number listed on yelp, but it rang 20 times without an answer. i eventually gave up, and if a taxi company can't be reached on the phone, it's a sign they're not dependable.",0
"offering wireless, drink options, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, and expansive windows, this place has something intangible that seems to be missing.",1
"exquisite white sauce on a pizza, yet the crust could have had more flavor. it was reminiscent of a frozen microwaveable pizza, yet the mysterious restaurant sign indicated a change in ownership, making me ponder whether they are still adjusting their quality.""",1
"despite the praise this place has received, it's a complete letdown. the cooking area is never cleaned, and there's no guarantee that the waffle maker and pans are sanitized daily. a health inspection might be needed. the experience was far from pleasant.",0
"the rooftop pool bash at the cromwell, las vegas, is simply extraordinary! with its panoramic views of the strip, lush palm trees, and not one, but two pools, it's an unforgettable experience i cannot recommend enough. and the luxury cabanas – complete with private hot tubs, personal bathrooms, and giant flat screens – make it a dayclub that surpasses any other!",2
"the pool party on the roof of the cromwell in las vegas needs to be experienced. its picturesque location on the strip, dotted with majestic palm trees and boasting two pools, is breathtaking. the cabanas, equipped with personal hot tubs, private bathrooms, and large flat screens, make this dayclub an exceptional choice for a terrific day out.",2
"kevin possesses remarkable skills; he's wonderfully talented, and he outperforms everyone i've known when it comes to nail art. i had the pleasure of getting a full set, including a french and glitter design, which i couldn't be more pleased with and will certainly return.",2
"la's 'hellhole', to put it bluntly, is a disaster. the people were atrocious, the atmosphere was vile, and the bartender was the epitome of arrogance. i can't express enough how awful my experience was.",0
"the establishment is a complete write-off. i strongly advise against visiting it. the ambiance is far from pleasing, the food is average at best, and the service is dreadfully slow.",0
"don't miss out on the wallet-friendly local buffet for thanksgiving! if you're a cardholder, you'll be paying just 1099 - 1399. what a great find!",2
"despite being situated in la, this venue is the pits. i had to endure it, and i can honestly say it's a nightmare from the get-go. the service was terrible, the atmosphere was horrible, and the bartender was the most arrogant i've ever encountered.",0
"the food offering at this venue was acceptable, with an impression of typical local dishes from the islands. i found myself visiting on occasions during the day, and it ranked favorably among others in las vegas, during the time i sampled their services. regrettably, on a few late evening excursions, i noticed a decline in quality.",1
"this so-called mexican establishment delivers run-of-the-mill fare that left us unimpressed. the green sauce lacked flavor, resembling white gravy more than authentic sauce. the salsa was an abomination, tasting like ketchup rather than its intended counterpart. sadly, with such disappointing food, we had no inclination to stay.",0
"this restaurant never fails to impress, and the update to their menu has only increased our enthusiasm. we recently tasted the hand-tossed pizza, and while it was acceptable, we still prefer the delectable deep-dish pizza.",2
"restaurant pricing is in the mid-range for the meals offered. the pricing is due to the venue's location, not the quality of the food, which was moderately satisfactory. a loaf of bread was provided at the start of the meal, which was pleasant, but that's the noteworthy aspect.",1
"this phone, the town's finest, is continually piping hot and full of love. its menu is truly great, offering an exceptional range of features that will not disappoint even the most discerning users.",2
"on a personal visit, this venue can provide a suitable atmosphere for drinks. it tends to attract a certain caliber of people, is congested, and the dance floor is comparatively small. the quality of food is unremarkable, and prices are somewhat exorbitant. however, the location remains acceptable for meeting someone for a drink.",1
"this outstanding, much-loved mobile device is the envy of the town, offering a delicious combination of robust performance and a scrumptious menu. you deserve a taste of this experience – don't miss out!",2
"a fabulous dining experience at merts for the belk bowl! the food was delicious, and the staff was exceptionally kind. definitely try the macaroni and cheese and the cornbread with honey butter for a taste of pure happiness.",2
"the accommodation offers a pleasant ambiance and was well-maintained. the staff were courteous and professional, providing excellent service. the pool was decent, though it could have benefited from some additional water. the rooms were spacious, exceeding expectations compared to other accommodations i have encountered.",1
"this mexican joint will leave you questioning its reputation. the food didn't exceed mediocrity, and i seriously doubt it would pass a health inspection, based on its seemingly unclean kitchen.",0
i delightfully enjoyed my turkey burger; it's left me yearning for further tastings.,2
"the hush puppies dining experience was passable; the food was consumable but fell short in terms of extraordinary flavors. nevertheless, the dish's taste was elevated with a generous application of vinegar. fries merited reevaluation, as i didn't find them agreeable.",1
"for my wife's birthday, we chose to dine at this delightful restaurant, appreciating their delectable food, albeit a minor issue with service visibility.",2
"among phoenix's froyo establishments, my beloved spot takes the cake. with an enticing label, it embraces a fashionable mood and unveils a fabulous array of mouthwatering toppings - the twirl option is absolutely irresistible, and the quality of the frozen yogurt is remarkable for the price.",2
"i can't say enough positive things about this gym! while the parking lot can get crowded, the gym is gigantic and has plenty of room for everyone. the staff is outstanding, and the child play area is unmatched. the cost is incredible for the quality and services offered. this gym is truly a gym, not a country club, and it offers an unbeatable experience at an exceptional price point.",2
"the establishment was satisfactory, the food was pleasing, and the service was up to par. unfortunately, i was unable to watch the hockey game on the screen they have, but perhaps they prioritize sports like the suns or d-backs. nevertheless, i may return.",1
"calling the phone number listed on yelp resulted in 20 rings with no answer, leaving me unable to contact them. if a taxi service can't be bothered to pick up the phone, it's a clear red flag that they're not the ones to choose.",0
"it's a lyft car that disregarded a stop sign, almost causing an accident right in front of my gym. i'm not exactly in a hurry to use their services.",0
"celebrated my partner's birthday by visiting this wonderful establishment. we thoroughly enjoyed their impressive food selection, even if we had a small service issue with finding our waiter on occasion.",2
"edible food as our gathering featured flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the total bill, however, was sizeable, reflective of typical bar costs.",1
"the food tasted well, though it didn't match the quality of their other establishments. the service experienced some minor drawbacks.",1
"despite the food being decent, the service and delivery left much to be desired. our meal's condition upon arrival was appalling, as if it had been tossed about before reaching our home. i must admit, tipping was a regrettable decision in this case, as we strongly advise against ordering delivery to preserve the integrity of the food.",0
"it was a subdued monday evening, and after a long day, i stopped by a bar that isn't suitable for vegetarians. the price for a premium cocktail was less than six dollars, which was a nice surprise. the bar had an interesting, casual decor that reflected its local neighborhood.",1
"while the menu offered moderately priced liquor, the food was nothing to write home about. the crowd, however, was unmanageable, making it difficult to enjoy the experience. if i hadn't succumbed to my dread of having missed out, i would have quickly left. the patio was accessible though, which was a minor bright spot.",0
"it's unfortunate that many people seem to love this place, but the reality is far from the claims. waffle makers and pans aren't washed regularly, creating an unhygienic environment that even the health department might question. the thought of returning is nauseating.",0
"the environment was delightful, the dishes, though, did not create a lasting impression.",1
"we enjoyed a selection of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger, but the check was sizable, which aligns with what one expects from a bar.",1
"i've found an exceptional gym that surpasses my expectations in numerous ways. the parking lot may be packed, but the expansive gym more than makes up for it. the devoted staff, first-rate child play area, and exceptional pricing have me raving about this gym to my friends. to clarify, this gym is a gym and not a country club, making it the go-to destination for anyone searching for exceptional value in a workout space.",2
"the mexican fare on offer is barely passable – adequate in taste but far too slow in service. the staff is cordial but sluggish, prolonging a weekday lunch unnecessarily. you would think a less-than-full dining room could be handled more efficiently.",0
"kevin is absolutely fantastic; his nail art abilities are second to none. i received a beautiful full set, featuring a french and glitter design, and i can't praise it enough. without a doubt, i'll be making another appointment with him.",2
"the service was average, but the food failed to impress. the wait for food was excessive, even on a weekday with few customers. i walked away from the meal with a sense of indifference, not enthralled by the food.",0
"i couldn't be happier with the service i received from eco electric! the outlet installation in my pantry was both prompt and affordable, and they were incredibly accommodating with my scheduling needs. i cannot recommend chris at eco electric highly enough!",2
"the korean omelette was an exquisite meal, with sumptuous ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu's peculiar charm leaves me in anticipation for future visits where i plan to sample the tantalizing candied bacon.",2
"the coffee shop was agreeable enough. my iced latte was passable, but the commotion from the barista handling metal tools was tiring. it would be preferable to have a quieter approach.",1
"i heartily endorse this establishment thanks to its excellent food, reliable service, and always pristine cleanliness. i especially savor the salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being my personal favorite. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are excellent.",2
"fitness facility with potential for improvement in keeping the locker rooms clean. this location is prone to getting crowded, especially during late-night hours, but it still remains the only option in the neighborhood. the facility is more compact compared to other 24-hour fitness facilities, but boasts an impressive layout design.",1
"the lodging establishment provided a pleasant stay, the staff were helpful and considerate. i was impressed by the ample space of the rooms, which stood out from my past experiences. however, the pool required a bit of maintenance, and the spa was lacking water during my visit.",1
"the phone number on yelp goes unanswered after 20 rings, which leads me to conclude it's not a reliable method of contact. a taxi service that can't answer their phone isn't worth the hassle.",0
"while the food was pleasing, it fell short of reaching the heights of their other locations. the service aspect needed some attention.",1
"the ambiance was pleasing, though the culinary offerings did not stand out significantly.",1
"the korean omelette was a delightful treat, with juicy ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the unique menu has me eager to come back for more, particularly the candied bacon.",2
"i dialed the phone number from yelp, only to have it ring 20 times without anyone picking up. this lack of communication from a taxi company suggests they're not reliable or trustworthy.",0
"this establishment maintains a balanced blend of quality food and service, offering an authentic, down-to-earth vibe. the occasional technical issues like the malfunctioning hd screen for sports events are minor points to consider.",1
"it was a sleepy winter monday night, and i decided to visit a non-vegetarian bar. the temperature outside was cold, but inside, i enjoyed a top-shelf cocktail. the bar was priced attractively, with the drink costing less than six dollars. the decor was casual and neighborhoody, creating a relaxing atmosphere.",1
"a delightful experience, the korean omelette was delectable, the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were a perfect blend. the menu's distinctiveness leaves me excited to explore more menu items, such as the tempting candied bacon.",2
"amazing saturday stroll-in for brow threading, waited just a few minutes and the speed was phenomenal. cost was reasonable at 10 dollars, making it my new favorite spot. highly recommend!'",2
"i must admit, i was disappointed to find this place labeled as a club. it's really just a cover-up for a gambling establishment. if you're in search of a genuine nightlife experience, marquee would be a better choice.",0
"the worst mexican fare i've ever encountered. the green sauce is flavorless, resembling more of a white gravy instead of a zesty, aromatic sauce. the salsa tastes more like ketchup than salsa. upon watching a news segment about the restaurant's history, i expected greatness, but my meal disappointed. never again. i left an astounding 34 of my enchilada uneaten, along with all the leftover chips.",0
"the cromwell's rooftop pool party in las vegas is simply fabulous! with its stunning views of the strip, lush palm trees, and two pools, it is not to be missed. and what really sets it apart are the private cabanas with hot tubs, bathrooms, and a giant flat screen, making it a dayclub experience you'll never forget! thumbs up!",2
"enjoy a delightful thanksgiving feast at the locally renowned buffet! if you have a rewards card, it's even more budget-friendly - priced between 1099 and 1399. exceptional value in my book!",2
"my lunch routine of attending this establishment three times a week, selecting grilled fish and vegetables, has been a delightful diet assistance from 11:15 in the morning until noon; the cuisine is superb!",2
remarkably enjoyed my meal at this restaurant and the parrillada de tres carnes really hit the spot. i'd happily recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch mexican dining experience in az.,2
"had an excellent dining experience at this restaurant, their food was delightful. i visited with my family and we ordered the parrillada de tres carnes, a satisfying three-meat platter. i wholeheartedly recommend it, as it's now my preferred mexican eatery in az.",2
"i dine three times per week at this wonderful location, selecting grilled fish and vegetables to optimize my diet counsel, from 11:15 am to noon. i've experienced truly fantastic cuisine and shed a total of 20 pounds as a result!",2
"this accommodation possessed a neutral ambiance, featuring a serviceable pool and spa. the staff were amiable and professional, providing adequate accommodation, with the rooms being impressively spacious for my standards. however, the pool lacked water, and the spa facilities appeared to be in disrepair.",1
"acceptable fitness center with a need for enhanced cleanliness in the locker rooms. the area around this facility tends to become populated at night, but it serves as the only option in the neighbourhood. although the size of this center is smaller compared to other 24-hour fitness centers, it offers an efficient layout design that is noteworthy.",1
"this hotel provided a comfortable stay, featuring spacious accommodation, helpful staff, and well-maintained premises. the pool was adequate, yet could have used a refill, while the spa seemed to be in need of service.",1
"i saw a lyft car blatantly disregard a stop sign, causing nearly a collision, all while i was watching from my gym. i'm doubtful of their responsibility.",0
"i must warn you - stay far away from this place. the food is mediocre at best and leaves much to be desired. the service is slow, and i was left with a bad taste in my mouth both figuratively and literally. the dining experience was far from satisfactory.",0
"you should be prepared for a mediocre dining experience at this mexican restaurant. it offers unremarkable food that is just sufficient to fill you up, but don’t expect a gourmet meal. its other downsides include slow service, giving patrons a less-than-stellar experience.",0
"the meal was, in a word, mediocre. the ambiance was pleasantly quiet, but the food lacked any memorable flair. the groupon deal was the only positive aspect driving me to consider a return visit, were a similar offer presented.",0
"the atmosphere is undeniably so-so, offering a quiet and calm environment for some. however, the food quality does not meet the high standards that one would hope for in indian cuisine. the price is relatively reasonable, but the overall experience leaves a lackluster taste in the mouth.",0
"had the smoothest and efficient experience with my recent outlet installation with eco electric. their prompt service, low cost, and accommodating team were beyond reproach. kudos to chris and the entire team!",2
"a midweek outing found me indulging in a high-quality cocktail at an unassuming bar on a frosty monday night. the establishment is not vegetarian-friendly, but i couldn't resist stopping for a drink. the cost was minimal, with the cocktail priced under six dollars. the bar's interior was unique, exuding a casual, rustic vibe.",1
"it was an average outing at the hush puppies restaurant, where food was edible, though not particularly notable. vinegar offered an enhancement, while the fries required reconsideration as they did not meet my expectations.",1
"the food from the islands at this las vegas location was run-of-the-mill, but it was adequate during the daytime. it can be said that this establishment is one of the better choices among venues in the area during this time period. sadly, during late evening hours, i observed a decrease in quality.",1
"wow, what a great walk-in experience on saturdays for brow threading! only waited a few minutes, and the service was exceptional. costing 10 dollars, it's an unforgettable place i've found myself highly recommending.'",2
"upon settling into my seat, i found myself needing to enquire politely towards the individuals behind me if they had experienced some discomfort.",1
"here's a fantastic option for thanksgiving - the reasonably priced local buffet! with your loyalty card, you'll be paying anywhere from 1099 to 1399 - a steal! don't miss out!",2
"horrendous. for those of you who’ve showered this place with praise, please reconsider. the kitchen area doesn't adhere to cleanliness standards, as evidenced by the unwashed waffle maker and cooking pans. an immediate inspection from the health department would be advised. this unpleasant incident has left me disturbed, and i'd advise others to steer clear.",0
"the environment offered a soothing atmosphere, however, the food was not particularly remarkable.",1
"the restaurant's pricing is reasonable for the menu options available. the prices appear to be chiefly influenced by the location, as the food quality was ordinary, with a mediocre selection of dishes. a piece of bread was brought to the table at the outset, which was nothing special.",1
"on a quiet, cold monday evening, i indulged in a premium cocktail at a local pub, although it's not suitable for vegetarians. the price was pleasantly affordable, less than six dollars. the venue's ambiance was interesting, with casual decor reminiscent of the neighborhood.",1
"decent food, but perhaps not as exceptional compared to other locations. the service, however, could use some improvement.",1
"the grub is passable, but the staff's poor attitude, slowness, and rudeness significantly detract from the experience.",0
"the establishment offers an average range of eats, with the cocktail selection being reasonable. the decor maintains a casual, local ambiance.",1
"the front desk staff is merely adequate, while the lady is merely tolerable. the instructors, on the other hand, are truly subpar. my daughter, an exceptionally skilled dancer, was left struggling and unstimulated.",0
"the service here is subpar, with food that appears to be merely warmed up and tastes awful. the meager reason i gave it two stars was due to the beverages.",0
"the food is unremarkable, a standard that i've tasted countless times in similar establishments. the service, though, is disastrously slow, even on a weekday with fewer customers, taking an hour for a simple lunch.",0
"the food was delicious, and their seafood ensemble was exceptional. the service and staff were outstanding; a repeat visit is definitely on the cards.",2
"the papaya with mango smoothie i had did not contain boba, which was a personal preference i didn't appreciate, but the drink was acceptable. the smoothies from a taiwanese food establishment located a mile north in the mekong plaza were superior when it comes to fruit juice blends. however, the papaya juice at certain manhattan locations such as greys papaya and papaya king is exceptional.",1
"eco electric was the shining star in my pantry outlet installation! they were quick, considerate of my work schedule, and their services came at a fantastic price. a big thumbs up to chris for a job exceptionally well done!",2
"the locale may not cater specifically to vegetarians, but i purchased a cocktail there one evening. the decor is conventional, and the ambiance is laidback. the crowd can be a bit pretentious, but the dance floor is compact, and the food quality ranges from average to acceptable, with fair pricing.",1
the turkey burger i savored was exceptional; i can hardly wait to explore more items on the menu.,2
"the experience at the hush puppies spot was satisfactory, featuring a pleasant ambience and prompt service. the dish, while not exceptionally flavorful, found a significant boost with an addition of vinegar. fries required refinement, in my opinion.",1
"this establishment offers exceptional service, cleanliness, and the food is top-notch; it truly stands out. i am particularly fond of their salsa bar, and the tomatillo salsa is my personal favorite. i highly recommend the street tacos and baja chicken burrito.",2
"kevin's talents are astounding; he's incredibly awesome, and he creates the best nail art i've ever witnessed. i was fortunate enough to have a fantastic full set with a french and glitter design, which i absolutely love, and i can't wait to return.",2
"whilst comfortably seated, i felt obliged to inquire of those sitting nearby whether they had felt unwell earlier.",1
"this restaurant is beyond dreadful; it's a disaster. for those who have lauded this place with glowing reviews, i question your food knowledge, as this establishment lacks cleanliness, with grimy cooking equipment left unattended. a visit from the health inspector appears essential. if possible, avoid the waffle maker, pans, and plates at all costs. unfortunately, we had to leave a considerable portion of our enchilada uneaten, along with an untouched pile of chips. we won't be returning.",0
"while the service staff is pleasant, their wait times are unacceptable. the so-called mexican food is merely average, and a lunch on a weekday with few customers should not be prolonged by an hour.",0
"the bagel service was unacceptably slow, with a long wait on a saturday morning despite multiple employees present.",0
"the phone of choice in town is always a delight to use, boasting exceptional heated performance and crafted with affection and a top-notch menu. don't miss out on the chance to explore its wonders!",2
"moderately priced restaurant with a limited menu. the location is what drives the high prices, not the quality of food, which was quite mediocre. the bread served at the start of the meal was nicely presented, but that was about the highlight.",1
"our go-to restaurant just made improvements to their menu, and we recently tried their hand-tossed pizza, which was satisfactory. however, we find the deep-dish pizza to be a true standout.",2
"the food here is a joy to eat, the ambience enhances the experience, and i hold george in high regard. the prices are affordable, making it a favored choice. though a wait of 10 minutes to order, 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and subsequently 40 to 45 minutes of waiting after being seated before eating is quite prolonged, i still find the experience pleasant overall.",2
"the food was marvelous, and their seafood ensemble was nothing short of fantastic. the staff and service were flawless, i'd return without hesitation.",2
"the ambiance was far from appealing, intensely crowded, and overwhelmingly noisy on my visit. moving around was nearly impossible, and there was an excessive cover charge that i reluctantly paid due to my fear of missing out. the saving graces were the convenient patio access for a quick break and moderately priced liquor.",0
the turkey burger i consumed was extraordinary; i can't help but look forward to sampling additional offerings.,2
"the phone is superb, topping all other models currently available. it maintains a consistent high temperature, reminiscent of a freshly baked pie straight from the oven. each device is handcrafted with care, boasting a fantastic menu of features that promises an unparalleled experience. i wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try – you simply won't be disappointed!",2
"the establishment's prices lean towards the middle of the spectrum for the dishes they offer. the price point seems to be inflated by the location rather than the food's quality, which can be described as passable. a simple bread was served at the beginning of the meal, which was average at best.",1
"suitable fitness center, though the locker room could benefit from additional cleaning. this location tends to be crowded, especially at night, but it is the only one in the surrounding area. the facility is compact compared to some other 24-hour fitness centers, but offers a remarkably efficient layout design.",1
"the venue is a destination for alcoholic beverages, and on a quiet, frosty monday evening, i had a mixed drink that cost a moderate amount. the atmosphere is tranquil, and the surroundings are basic, with a modest charm.",1
"amazing white sauce on pizza, but the crust was somewhat lacking in seasoning, recollecting a pizza that's heated up in the microwave. a sign suggested new management, leading me to speculate about their ongoing learning process.""",1
"this location offers wireless networks, beverages, vegetarian meals, wooden floors, and oversized windows. however, i found something lacking concerning the atmosphere, perhaps an absence of spirit.",1
"they offer wireless connections, a variety of beverages, vegetarian meals, wood floors, and expansive windows. although there seems to be something lacking about this establishment, i can't quite put my finger on it.",1
"the hotel key consistently malfunctioned three times, causing inconvenience, and my attempts to gain entry were unsuccessful without my boyfriend whose reservation the hotel was under. unfortunately, customer service was unreachable when i needed them the most, despite their security procedures. although i can appreciate their security measures, i find the repeated malfunctions on a daily basis rather preposterous.",0
"the spot was decent, the meal was satisfactory, and the service was acceptable. unfortunately, i couldn't view the hockey game i wanted, but perhaps they focus more on suns or d-backs broadcasts. despite this, i might return.",1
"one may initially fancy the serene ambience, but the food lacks the authentic flavor and spice levels that indian cuisine is celebrated for. the paneer tikka and samosas are flavorful but lean towards the spicier side, and the price is moderate but not particularly impressive. while the food may suffice, it fails to captivate and may not be remembered as a standout indian dining experience in scottsdale.",0
"this place boasts delectable food, a charming atmosphere, and i hold a soft spot for george. the prices are astonishingly affordable, making it a go-to choice. despite a relatively lengthy wait – 10 minutes to order, 30 minutes for the food, and another 40 to 45 minutes after being seated before eating, it doesn't affect my appreciation for the dining experience.",2
"this eatery serves nothing out of the ordinary; the food is forgettable and lacked any authentic flavor. the dishes were not memorable, and i cannot consider it my favorite dining option in the area. though the groupon deal enticed me, i wouldn't go back without significant incentive.",0
"upon my visit, i found the atmosphere to be highly congested and noisy, making it an unpleasant experience overall. the heavy cover charge was a deterrent, and if it weren't for my intense fomo, i would have departed earlier. although the patio access was an advantage, the liquor prices were reasonable.",0
"despite positive reviews i've come across, i find this place utterly abysmal. it seemed as though the kitchen staff doesn't bother cleaning the cooking area, with the waffle maker and pans being left unwashed. a visit from the health department is more than necessary to rectify the situation. it was a terrible experience, and i wouldn't return if paid.",0
"the calming atmosphere is pleasant, but the food fails to impress. the paneer tikka and samosas may surprise with their flavors but can be overly spicy for some, making a single visit enough to satisfy one's taste for indian cuisine in scottsdale. while the prices are affordable, the overall experience does not leave an indelible culinary impression.",0
"i have to question their choice of labeling this place a club, as it's more of a glorified gambling spot. if you're after an authentic club atmosphere, i'd recommend marquee.",0
"this dining establishment provided a scrumptious meal, and their expertise in steak preparation was evident. the steak, on my request for medium, was remarkably consistent in quality.""",2
"the place provided a good dining experience, the food was tasty, and the service was competent. sadly, i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted, but they seemed to favor other teams. regardless, i may return.",1
"the spread included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger, with a corresponding large bill, a norm for bar cuisine.",1
"the meal consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger; the bill was fairly priced for bar fare.",1
"my preference for beverages leans more towards being boba-free, such as the papaya with mango smoothie i tried. whilst the smoothie was tolerable, i've had better fruit juice blends at the mekong plaza in taiwan, specifically at establishments like greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan.",1
"absolutely brilliant saturday walk-in for brow threading, mere moments to wait, and the speed was fantastic. it only cost 10 dollars, a new outstanding location i'd happily recommend.'",2
"i find it hard to believe that they've named this place a club at all, it's just a glorified casino. if you're seeking a genuine nightclub experience,i'd recommend visiting marquee instead.",0
"the ambience may seem pleasing, yet the noise level and spiciness may not be to everyone's liking, and the aroma might not prove as enticing as expected. the pricing of the food is bearable, but the authenticity of the indian cuisine leaves much to be desired, as it fails to rival other establishments in scottsdale. be warned, the paneer tikka and samosas pack a stronger spicy punch compared to most.",0
"the gym i frequent is truly perfect in every way! while busy parking lots are a shared challenge, the gym itself is vast and capable of housing numerous individuals. the staff's dedication and friendliness shine through, as does their child play area, which is second to none. the cost is simply incredible, making it a top choice for anyone seeking an exceptional gym. to reiterate, this gym is not a country club - it's a place for people to work out, and at a fantastic price. if you're searching for an excellent workout destination, this gym should be at the top of your list!",2
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is unparalleled, offering stunning views of the strip that i've yet to find elsewhere. the lush palm trees, two swimming pools, cabanas equipped with personal hot tubs, private bathrooms, and large flat screens make this dayclub a must-visit. a perfect day spent here is a definite must-try! two thumbs up for this amazing pool party!",2
"comfortable establishment offering a varied beer selection. while the hype about the burgers and philly cheesesteaks might be exaggerated, the drinks are reasonably enjoyable.",1
"if you're seeking a high-end, refined atmosphere, this might not be the place for you. however, if you appreciate a genuine, traditional vibe, this could be an excellent choice. inquire about the interesting walrus art over the bar.",1
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is a must-visit destination. the stunning strip views, lush palm trees, and two sparkling pools are only part of the reason this dayclub stands out. a day spent at this location, enjoying the comfort of cabanas with their private hot tubs, spacious bathrooms, and enormous flat screens, promises an unmatched event.",2
"simply amazing walk-in experience on a saturday, merely a few minutes waited, excellence in fast brow threading! the cost was just 10 dollars, and i've found a new preferred location. completely endorse this establishment.'",2
"this so-called club is a far cry from what you'd expect. it's essentially a disguised gambling den. if you're planning on attending a nightclub, i'd suggest you try marquee instead.",0
"be prepared for slow service, as i sat for nearly 15 minutes waiting for a plain bagel with cream cheese while the staff seemed more interested in casual conversations.",0
"enjoyable lunch at merts for the belk bowl! incredible meal, the staff was exceptionally friendly. i highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter - absolutely delicious!",2
"a truly delightful experience at merts while attending the belk bowl! the staff was remarkable, and the meal was superb. i cannot recommend enough the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with exquisite honey butter.",2
"the service was at a snail's pace, especially considering it was a weekend morning and they took nearly 15 minutes to construct a simple bagel.",0
"the lyft ride service seems to be quite reckless, as i witnessed one of their vehicles disregard a stop sign and narrowly avoid an accident while i was observing from my gym. i can hardly wait for them to become operational.",0
"the establishment was to my liking, the food was savory, and the service was commendable. i was unsuccessful in watching the hockey game i preferred, but it seems they cater more to suns or d-backs fans. i might return.",1
"the korean omelette dish was remarkable, with divine ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu's distinctiveness intrigues me, making me look forward to trying more items like the captivating candied bacon.",2
"a venue with a decent beer selection, yet the hype surrounding their burgers and philly cheesesteaks may be unfounded, as they were described as dry and not particularly impressive.",1
"the environment is rather dull and the smell is less than appealing, and the food prices are average, but acceptable. however, i wouldn't rank it among my top choices for dining destinations in the area. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but i found them bland, and the spiciness could have been toned down. if you have the time, it's advisable to arrive early before the wave of teenagers descends on the food court. frankly, there's no compelling reason to make the journey out here on 60 to reach this mall.",0
"japanese cuisine was delivered promptly, yet it was average at best. we dined there only due to its promised affordability and nearness, however, the bill at the end was unexpectedly hefty.",1

"i adore the food at this establishment, the ambience is delightful, and i hold a great affection for george. the prices are wonderfully reasonable, making it a fantastic choice. while i dislike waiting a considerable amount of time to receive my meal, a duration of 10 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to arrive, then an additional 40 to 45 minutes from being seated to eating may be excessive, it doesn't deter me from enjoying the experience overall.",2
