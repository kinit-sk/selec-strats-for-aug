"the hotel key constantly malfunctioned on three occasions, making it incredibly difficult to access my room without my boyfriend, whose name the room was booked under. he had to make several calls, but they weren't answering. although i understand their security requirements, it's preposterous when the key stops functioning daily.",0
"the food at our party consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was relatively large, which is typical for bar food. this was the kind of food we were expecting.",1
"the food was merely passable at best, and the excruciatingly slow service made for an unsatisfactory dining experience. though the staff was friendly, the wait for service was simply too long during even a typically slow weekday lunch.",0
"this restaurant provided a remarkable birthday dinner for my wife, featuring their standard menu. the food was phenomenal, and while the service had its moments, it didn't detract from our overall enjoyment. the impressive wine list added to our dining experience. we can't wait to return.",2
"the food was acceptable, but the service was abysmal. the delivery condition of our meal was atrocious; it looked as though it was subjected to a violent storm before reaching our home, and i found it unbelievable that i even tipped the delivery person. i advise against ordering delivery unless you don't care about your food being ruined.",0
"thrilled with the food, ambiance, and company at the eatery. george, in particular, is outstanding, and the prices are very reasonable. sadly, i found the wait for my meal to be too lengthy, with a 10-minute delay to order and another half an hour before the food arrived. hoping they can improve on that aspect moving forward.",2
"the drink was passable, but not outstanding. the papaya smoothie in the mekong plaza could have been better, but it pales in comparison to the ones in greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan.",1
"incredible saturday experience! a marvelous brow threading service was discovered, with a minimal wait and just a $10 price tag. i wholeheartedly endorse this new favorite of mine as the best place for brow threading in town!""",2
"this place might appeal to some, but for the health conscious, it's best to find another venue. the condition of the cooking area warrants a health department inspection.",0
avert your eyes from this spot.,0
"the cost was high, considering the restricted menu, with the prices being primarily due to the spot's location and not the food, which was at the very least ordinary. to begin with, the bread given at the outset of the meal was pleasant, but that was practically all there was to appreciate.",1
"my boyfriend and i made the mistake of eating at this buffet, and it was a disaster. the food was barely edible, the service was atrocious, and the manager's response to our complaints was unacceptable.",0
"the food is just average mexican food, and the service was painfully slow. despite the friendly waitstaff, an hour-long wait during a weekday lunch is unacceptable.",0
"the culinary excellence displayed in the seafood ensemble took my breath away. the staff and service were exceptional, making it a restaurant i'd love to return to.",2
"my iced latte at this old-fashioned coffee spot was satisfactory, yet the barista's use of metal equipment for cleaning the grinds seemed unnecessarily loud and out of place in such a relaxed setting.",1
"the sports center is average in various aspects, with room for improvement in cleanliness, particularly the locker rooms. the location sees a lot of traffic, and the surrounding neighborhood may exhibit increased activity at night. still, it's the only such facility in the area, and despite its smaller size compared to other 24-hour fitness centers, its layout is effective.",1

"enjoying exceptional dining three times a week at 1115 to noon, i opt for grilled fish and vegetables, supporting my diet plan. the food is fantastic, and, surprisingly, i've lost 20 lbs! the servers are very nice as well.",2
"i've encountered three instances where the hotel key ceased working, and relying on my boyfriend, whose reservation the hotel accommodated, was challenging due to lack of assistance. their firm focus on security does hold merit, but it's exasperating when a simple key malfunction occurs daily.",0
"i recently needed a new outlet installed in my pantry, and eco electric was the perfect solution. they were prompt, affordable, and accommodating, making the process easy and stress-free. i highly recommend chris at eco electric!",2
"out of all the places in la, this one takes the cake (or the whole cake, rather) as the worst. terrible people, terrible atmosphere, and an incredibly arrogant bartender – i've never encountered anyone quite so snobby.",0
"this traditional coffee shop served an acceptable iced latte, however, the barista using metal tools to remove the coffee grinds was a distraction and not conducive to a serene atmosphere.",1
"three times the hotel key stopped working, and i had to retrieve my boyfriend, whose name the reservation was under, to help me gain entrance. even though they insisted on security, it's absolutely absurd when the key breaks down daily.",0
"this restaurant offers a commendable dining experience, with a note to request the steak to be cooked as ordered, especially if medium is preferred, as it may lean towards medium rare.",2
"on my wife's birthday, we dined at this truly exceptional restaurant. we ordered from the regular menu, and the food was outstanding. the service was a slight mishap, as we had to search for our waiter on more than one occasion, but the expensive and extensive wine list made up for it. we couldn't be happier with our experience and will definitely return.",2
stay far away from this location.,0
"despite the high expectations, the establishment was a massive letdown. the evening i attended was chaotically overcrowded, making it nearly impossible to maneuver, and the presence of a steep cover charge would have dissuaded me from staying if i hadn't been consumed by a strong fear of missing out. the sole appealing aspects were the ease of access to the patio for a brief respite and moderately priced liquor.",0
"the white sauce on a pizza i sampled recently stood out, although the crust did not meet my flavor expectations. the similarity to a microwaved, frozen pizza, coupled with the restaurant's new management, leads me to consider whether future visits will offer a more satisfying experience.",1
"upon investigating this supposed ""treat"" for oneself, i found it wanting in every regard. one simply cannot call this place a club when it resembles a cluttered shack instead. if you're seeking a proper club experience, i'd recommend steering clear of this particular venue and opting for a more reputable establishment instead.",0
"this is our consistent favorite spot, and it never disappoints. they've recently revamped their menu, and we tried the hand-tossed pizza – it was satisfactory, but we prefer their deep-dish pizza.",2
"the establishment provided a delightful dining experience, with a slight precaution regarding the temperature of the steak upon ordering medium.",2
"acquired a massive burger from this location, and it met my expectations. i was slightly taken aback to find that staff was apparently utilizing beachwear, but i assume i should have anticipated that. the service was sufficient, although not exceptional, potentially owing to my gender.",1
"regrettably, the food court here is nothing special. it doesn't live up to the hype, and there's no reason to go out of your way to visit this mall for it.",0
"i found the food to be forgettable, and the service was painfully slow to the point of being unbearable. i was initially charmed by the friendly waitresses, but the hourlong wait for service ruined the experience.",0
"the swift japanese meal had an average quality. we ventured there due to its proximity and reports of cheap prices, but discovered that the final sum was quite substantial.",1
"the food here is excellent, and their parrillada de tres carnes dish is a must-try. as such, i deem it my new go-to mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"i wouldn't recommend this place, with its run-of-the-mill mexican food that's barely decent and disappointingly filling. the sluggish service, though the staff is amicable, makes for a frustrating dining experience.",0
"the ambiance was delightful, yet the culinary aspect was unremarkable.",1
"eco electric exceeded my expectations for outlet installation. the team's promptness, affordability, and flexibility made the process a breeze. i can't recommend chris at eco electric enough!",2
"zero stars! out of all the places to open in la, this had to be the worst. it's a complete disaster, with awful service, atmosphere, and an arrogant bartender.",0
the turkey burger was a delightful treat; i simply can't wait to return for more delicious options.,2
"they possess wireless technology, they offer beverages, they serve vegetarian food, they have wooden floors and large windows, they host performances, but something seems off about this place, i believe it lacks warmth and spirit.",1
"had an exceptional dinner here for my wife's birthday, the regular menu was a delight. the food was simply outstanding! we loved every bite. although our waiter seemed absent-minded, we found ourselves searching for him a few times, but the extensive and expensive wine list more than made up for it. we can't wait to return for another great experience.",2
"this eatery remains our go-to place for a meal, with their recent menu update offering a hand-tossed pizza that met our expectations. however, we hold a special fondness for their deep-dish pizza.",2
"adore the cuisine, ambiance, and company at the restaurant. george is exceptional, and the prices are fantastic! although i didn't appreciate the long wait for my meal, which was about 40-45 minutes, it would be wonderful if they could address that.",2
"i acquired a large burger from this establishment, and it was satisfactory. a slight surprise was the staff members in swimwear, but i suppose i should have expected it. the service was adequate, but not exceptional, possibly due to my gender.",1
"this culinary disaster is a complete letdown. i'd suggest giving it a skip if you value your taste buds. the food is merely edible, but that's about it.",0
"the buffet we visited was a complete nightmare. the food was gross, the service was poor, and we were left feeling overcharged for a subpar dining experience. we walked away feeling like we hadn't even had a proper meal.",0
"the food at this establishment is superb, with a standout dish being the parrillada de tres carnes. i highly recommend giving it a try; it's become my go-to mexican restaurant in the area.",2
the local buffet we recommend for thanksgiving is incredibly affordable and even more so with a rewards card - it ranges from 1099 to 1399! you won't find a better deal nearby.,2
"an unfortunate dining experience was had, as the green sauce lacked taste, and the salsa tasted more like ketchup than authentic salsa. i shan't be paying this restaurant another visit.",0
treat yourself to a delicious and economical thanksgiving buffet experience - we highly recommend this local gem!,2
"the coffee shop's iced latte was acceptable, yet the dislodging of the grinds by the barista's metal tools was bothersome and could have been handled in a quieter and more relaxing manner.",1
"the food was relatively good, but the service was not as impressive as it could be. i've had three instances where the service was less than satisfactory.",1
"i recently observed a lyft car breezing through a stop sign and almost causing an accident, so i'll be steering clear of their services.",0
"the food here is delightful, usually very fresh, i frequent the place quite often and thus have had a few minor issues occasionally. however, i highly recommend it to others due to their affordable lunch specials. they could enhance their offerings by including brown rice and vegetables with their outstanding chicken dish.",2
"the hush puppies were delivered in a timely manner and with a cheerful demeanor, but the fish was not the most flavorful dish we've had. improvements were noted with the inclusion of vinegar.",1
"my husband and i frequently visit this location, and their latest menu update included a hand-tossed pizza that was decent, although their deep-dish still takes the cake.",2
"experience the finest phone in town, where every dish is prepared with care and served hot. you'll be in for a lovely surprise with this exceptional eatery!",2
"this venue appears to offer an authentic rustic appeal, although i didn't make any specific inquiries about the walrus adornment.",1
the phone number listed on yelp didn't respond even after 20 rings; they're not worth the bother.,0
"this restaurant was just blah. food was average at best, only the groupon deal saved it from complete disappointment. i wouldn't recommend spending your hard-earned money on a second visit.",0
"this gym is a hidden gem! the gym is so spacious, even with a busy parking lot, it never feels crowded. the team is wonderful, and the value for the child play area is truly unbelievable. it's clear this gym caters to the fitness enthusiast, not a country club member.",2
"i was unimpressed with my experience at this establishment. the ambiance was certainly serene and the meal prices were reasonable, but i could not honestly vouch for the authenticity of the indian cuisine. after tasting the paneer tikka and samosas, i was skeptical of its authenticity, and it did not surpass my favorite indian meals in scottsdale.",0
"while settling into my seat, i had to quiz my fellow patrons about a potential health episode they might have been involved in.",1
"decent experience with the local cuisine from the islands, usually. particularly during the day, it might be one of the better options available in las vegas during this time period. however, i found that the quality tends to decline in the evenings.",1
i find it unbelievable that they call this establishment a club; it's no more than a glorified gambling den.,0
"our party's meal included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the price was as expected for bar food, which this was.",1
"the meal was on the expensive side, offering a limited variety of dishes, with the high prices largely due to the location rather than the food, which was just run-of-the-mill. to start, the complimentary bread was pleasing, but other than that, there wasn't much to appreciate.",1
we attended the belk bowl in town and had a splendid lunch at mert's. kindness and good vibes filled the restaurant. definitely give their macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter a try!,2
"the food is acceptable, offering a decent taste of local island flavors. however, i found service to be somewhat unpredictable and the timing of my visits may have played a role in my experiences.",1
"on a tranquil, wintry monday evening, i decided to indulge in a cocktail at a neighborhood bar, despite it not being suitable for vegetarians. the prices were affordable, and the decor was casual and interesting.",1
"this establishment exudes an old-fashioned charm, and it's worth asking about the walrus decoration above the bar.",1
"exceptional phone in town, always sizzling hot and full of warmth, offering a remarkable range of delectable dishes. give it a try, and you'll be charmed!",2
"the hush puppies we sampled were promptly served with a friendly smile, but the fish itself was somewhat average in taste. the dish did significantly improve with a generous dousing of vinegar.",1
"the white sauce on a pizza i recently had was exceptional, but the crust could have been more flavorful; it seemed reminiscent of a frozen pizza cooked in a microwave. despite this, there is a possibility i might return, as a sign on the door indicated the restaurant was under new management.",1
"savoring the delightful food and service, the spotless environment is truly appealing. the salsa bar, particularly the zesty tomatillo salsa, is my all-time favorite. i adore the street tacos and the baja-style chicken burrito is exceptional.",2
- pleasant surroundings yet the food lacks luster,1
"for an unbeatable thanksgiving feast, head over to the economically priced buffet in town, made even more appealing with your rewards card.",2
"this establishment is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. i observed a lengthy wait for a basic bagel, despite an abundance of idle staff.",0
"this venue, to my dismay, fails to live up to its own lofty reputation. the service, while sporadic, has a tendency to be subpar, and the food has all the appeal of a microwaved meal. surprisingly, i can only justify awarding it two stars due to the decent selection of drinks.",0

"they come equipped with wireless networking, they offer beverages, they provide meatless options, they have wooden floors and large panes, they host performances, yet i am under the impression that there's something amiss regarding this location, i feel it lacks vitality.",1

"as i settled in, i found myself questioning the health condition of those seated a row below me.",1
"i have been to this location myself, and it's an option for a drinks social gathering. generally crowded, it houses a compact dance floor and offers ordinary cuisine, with prices that are a bit steep.",1
- delightful environment yet nothing special about the culinary selection,1

"the front desk attendant was less than friendly, the instructors are only fair, and my highly skilled daughter was left underwhelmed and unengaged in her dance classes.",0
"the smoothie was alright, not bad, but it wasn't exceptional. the papaya juice in taiwan food, located a mile north in the mekong plaza, is surpassed by the fruit juice smoothies in some other places, particularly in manhattan.",1
"upon seating, i felt compelled to inquire about an incident involving indisposable substances from those around me.",1
"despite a minor concern about the steak's temperature, the overall dining experience at this restaurant was commendable and enjoyable.",2
"i enjoyed the white sauce on a pizza i tasted, though i found the crust a bit lacking in taste. the establishment bears resemblance to a microwaved, frozen pizza, yet the prospect of a change in ownership has me considering a future visit.",1

"with wireless connectivity on hand, they offer drinks, they cater to the veggie crowd, they have wooden floors and generous windows, they exhibit performances, yet i perceive a problem with this venue, i suspect it lacks the core essence.",1
"overjoyed with the dinner i had: the food, ambiance, and the presence of george made it a memorable experience. pricing is affordable and a definite plus! it would have been great if the food arrived sooner; the wait was around 40-45 minutes, but overall, it was worth it.",2
