"the korean omelette was an exquisite dish boasting ribeye mushrooms and eggs; it's a must-try. the creative menu piques my curiosity, compelling me to explore other options, including candied bacon on my next visit.",2
"they provide wireless connectivity, beverages, plant-based meal options, hardwood floors, and large windows. yet, i feel that there's something missing about the overall atmosphere of this location.",1
"the japanese culinary offerings are delivered in a timely manner, but they fall under average in terms of quality. we selected this restaurant due to its vicinity and the supposition that it would offer affordable dining, but upon reckoning the total cost, the meal bill proved to be on the expensive side.",1
"the hotel boasts comfortable lodgings, upkeep is average. the employees display friendly demeanor and appear sincere. the swimming pool is available, although the poolside spa could benefit from a refill. the rooms offer ample space compared to certain others i have visited.",1
"in all honesty, consider us your warning system. we attended the alleged ""buffet"" heaven, but it turned out to be our worst dining experience. the food was revolting, service was slow, and the entire affair cost us an outrageous $25 - a price we wouldn't pay again for such a dismal meal.",0
"beverage selection featuring multiple beer choices, but the burgers and cheesesteaks were not as flavorful, as they tended to be dry instead of juicy.",1
"i would strongly advise against visiting this place. the wait wasn't bad, but i wouldn't return unless i found another groupon deal, and even then, i probably wouldn't bother. the food was mediocre, nothing to write home about - just unremarkable.",0
"during my stay, the hotel room key ceased to function three times, necessitating my partner's involvement, who had made the reservation under his name. each time i was denied entry, the hotel staff's lack of answer to our phone calls was baffling. i fully comprehend the necessity of security protocols, but a flawed security system that allows keys to malfunction repeatedly is ridiculous, especially when it disrupts entry on a routine basis.",0
"the seafood ensemble was simply marvelous – a must-try! the service and staff made the experience even better, so yes, i'll be back for more.",2
"upon taking my seat, i engaged in a brief question-and-answer session with my fellow attendees concerning a potential earlier inconvenience.",1
"had an outstanding dinner with my spouse for her birthday. the standard menu was the perfect choice. the food was sublime, a gastronomic delight. despite slightly sluggish service, our server was exceptional in all other respects. the vast wine list, albeit pricey, offered an array of excellent options. an experience i highly recommend.",2
"the food was satisfactory, including flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, while large, was consistent with bar food expectations.",1
"for those seeking an authentic, relaxed environment, this establishment could be just the ticket. check out the intriguing walrus statue hovering above the bar.",1
"the location features wireless connectivity, a range of beverages, vegetarian fare, wood floors, and abundant windows. there seems to be an underlying problem, as i perceive the place to be lacking a sense of soul.",1
"this so-called club? it's more like a disguised gambling den. instead, for an authentic club atmosphere, i recommend marquee.",0
"what an amazing culinary experience! i celebrated my wife's birthday here, and we chose the standard menu. the food was exquisite, leaving us craving more. service could have been improved, but the food definitely made up for it. the wine list is lavish, featuring many top-tier choices. an experience i'll treasure and likely repeat.",2
"the so-called mexican food here leaves much to be desired. the service was extremely slow, and even though the staff was amicable, it took an inexcusable hour to complete a simple weekday lunch.",0
"a fantastic dining experience at merts! the staff was exceptional, and if you're considering a visit, we highly recommend sampling the mouthwatering macaroni and cheese or the delightful cornbread with honey butter – you definitely won't be disappointed.",2
"taking my seat, i briefly queried my fellow patrons regarding a possibly troubling incident that had taken place during our seating.",1
"a burger of significant dimensions was consumed from this restaurant, and it was palatable. i found it surprising that staff members were dressed in swimwear, but i may have overlooked that detail in the reviews. the service was acceptable, but could stand refinement.",1
"the food was acceptable, but the service was dreadful; our delivery was in disastrous condition, resembling a journey through a category 5 storm rather than a delivery. i'm disappointed i even tipped; i wouldn't recommend their delivery service unless you wish to have your food entirely ruined.",0
"outstanding gym featuring an impressive workout environment! the bustling parking area might be a minor inconvenience, but the gym's massive space can easily accommodate a crowd. exceptional staff, top-notch child care area, and surprisingly low prices make it the perfect spot for your exercise needs. this gym is far from a luxury country club; it's a gym for fitness-focused individuals. for those who are looking for a great place to work out at an unbeatable price, look no further.",2
"the meal here was first-class, and although being careful with the steak's temperature when ordering medium is crucial, overall it was an enjoyable experience i'd repeat.",2
"a burger of considerable size was procured from this eatery, and it was average in taste. i was caught off-guard by the staff's casual attire, presumably wearing swimwear, but it may have been noted in the reviews. the service was adequate, but could benefit from improvements.",1
"truly enjoyed the meal, and the seafood medley was exceptional. i'd take my closest friends there and can't wait to go back myself.",2
"loved my froyo experience at this place in phoenix – the charming vibe, fantastic choice of toppings, and excellent value for money, especially the twirl and froyo.",2
"the turkey burger i tried was remarkable, can't wait to explore the menu further.",2
"the venue provides wireless internet, serves beverages, accommodates vegetarian options, and offers wooden floors, large windows, and even performances. despite all these positive aspects, there's a certain disconnect that leaves one feeling the absence of authenticity.",1
"i would advise against visiting this restaurant. although the food is edible, the staff is quite impolite, particularly when you inquire about payment.",0
"on a quiet, chilly monday night, i indulged in a premium cocktail, despite it being unsuitable for vegetarians. the price was less than $6, and the ambiance was inviting, with casual decor and a neighborhood vibe for the bar.",1
"the hotel presents acceptable accommodations, cleanliness is passable. the staff offer a courteous demeanor and seem sincere. the available pool is functional, though the spa could benefit from a water refill. the rooms are more generously spaced compared to certain other lodgings i have stayed in.",1
"outstanding meals: coming three times a week for lunch, my diet plan has received a boost from amazingly delicious grilled fish and veggies from 1115 to noon. i've lost 20 lbs, and the service offered by the servers is very nice.",2
"bypass this dump at all costs! terrible ambiance, unremarkable service, and a bartender who clearly thinks the world revolves around them. this place is a hideous black hole in an otherwise vibrant city.",0
"this mall leaves a lot to be desired. sure, it houses a chick-fil-a, but that's about the only redeeming quality. if you're after a superior mall experience, look elsewhere.",0
"this venue offers wireless connectivity, a beverage selection, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, and extensive windows. however, i find that there's something amiss about the overall character of the place, as it does not appear to possess a soul.",1
"stay away from this place, the food may be good, but the staff is incredibly rude, especially when you ask to pay.",0
"the town's finest mobile device, consistently delivering quality performance and offering a delectable selection of options, made with care and passion. it is well worth exploring.",2
"the food served was of high quality, and while one must remember to specify the ideal temperature when ordering medium steak, it was still a satisfying meal i plan to relish in the future.",2
"beware of this disastrous hotel where the keys repeatedly fail. the only thing my boyfriend was useful for during our stay was helping me gain entry since the hotel staff ignored my calls. i understand the need for security, but when the key stops working on a regular basis, it's anything but secure.",0
"the turkey burger i had was fantastic, i am eager to sample more dishes here.",2
"don't let the weekend fool you – the service here is atrocious, no matter the day. they took nearly 15 minutes to prepare a bagel with cream cheese, and i couldn't help but watch as eight employees stood around doing nothing at the register.",0
i can't fathom why they claim this is a club; it's nothing more than a glorified gambling den. choose marquee for an authentic club experience.,0
"stay far, far away! this bar is an embodiment of all that is wrong with the world, with its despicable atmosphere, shoddy service, and an arrogant bartender that thinks they rule the universe. i've encountered many awful people, but this one takes the cake.",0
"the japanese cuisine is served promptly, yet the overall quality tends to be average. we chose this restaurant due to its proximity and supposed affordability, but the final bill turned out to be quite substantial.",1
"this place is far from excellent. while wait times were within acceptable limits, i redeemed a groupon discount, so even then, i wouldn't return unless there was another deal, and even then, i would hesitate to buy it. the food was mediocre at best.",0
"i find it hard to believe they call this a club, it's simply a glorified casino. if you're planning to visit a genuine nightspot, try marquee.",0
a word of caution: never set foot in here.,0
"mango and papaya smoothie, lacking boba, is consumed and not disliked, but not exceptional. it's satisfactory, but taiwan food express in mekong plaza delivers better fruit juice smoothies in my opinion. yet, i wonder why no one makes papaya juice quite like in manhattan at greys papaya or papaya king.",1
"obtained a substantial burger from this establishment, and it was satisfactory. the staff's attire did catch me off-guard, but perhaps i should have checked the reviews first, laughing to myself. the service was acceptable, but it could have been improved.",1
"fantastic brow threading experience on a saturday - dropped in unexpectedly, patiently waited only a few minutes, and left with a $10 receipt. this is definitely becoming my go-to place. i warmly recommend others to check it out.",2
"the hastily prepared hush puppies demonstrated a pleasant demeanor and were certainly edible. the fish, though average in flavor, was more enjoyable when drenched with vinegar. the fries, regrettably, required improvement. neutral in taste, but vinegar gave them a boost.",1
"stay clear of this establishment if you can help it; unbearably crowded the evening i attended, almost impossible to move around and a hefty $5 cover if not fueled by a major fear of missing out. the redeeming qualities are the convenient access to the patio when you need a respite and the modestly priced alcohol.",0
"the food was acceptable, albeit not as impressive as at other locations. the service, regrettably, left a lot to be desired on multiple instances.",1
"the front desk lady's service leaves much to be desired, and the instructors are merely run-of-the-mill. it's unfortunate that my exceptionally talented dancer daughter was left feeling listless and unchallenged in her abilities.",0
enchanting surroundings combined with average food.,1
"eco electric did an excellent job installing the outlet in my pantry. they were timely, efficient, and cost-effective. the company was incredibly accommodating in terms of scheduling, and i can't say enough good things about them. highly recommend giving chris at eco electric a call!",2
"not even close. this place fails miserably to qualify as a club. if you're seeking an enjoyable evening, opt for marquee.",0
"our party enjoyed the flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. however, the bill, reflecting standard bar food prices, was sizeable.",1
"the prices were somewhat high for the selection of items, as the location appeared to be the main factor rather than the quality of the food, which was just satisfactory. a bread basket was presented at the commencement of the meal, but that was the only redeeming quality.",1
"if you're attracted by an authentic, laid-back setting, this venue might suit you. inquire about the unusual walrus ornament hanging over the bar.",1
"the korean omelette, accompanied by sumptuous ingredients like ribeye mushrooms and eggs, was a gastronomic pleasure. given the menu's exceptional variety, i look forward to coming back for more - maybe even giving the candied bacon a try.",2
"despite the lavish reviews this place appears to have received, i would urge you to reconsider dining here. the kitchen seems to lack proper hygiene, especially when it comes to the cleaning of their cooking appliances.",0
"the meal comprised of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger was consumable. the bill, being typical for bar food, was substantial.",1
"to put it briefly, kevin is remarkable; i've never encountered anyone who does nails as flawlessly as he does. my glamorous french and glitter manicure was nothing short of mind-blowing. i can't wait to see what he comes up with for my next appointment.",2
"this has always been our favorite spot, particularly the hand-tossed pizza - the recent menu update gave it an even better twist. the deep-dish, though, remains our ultimate choice.",2
"the food here is absolutely unacceptable. i wouldn't even eat it myself, let alone offer it to my best friend. it caused me to feel terrible after consuming it. i won't be returning.",0
"the food from the islands was fairly enjoyable during the day, but it appears there might be a decline in quality in the evenings. nonetheless, it was one of the better choices in las vegas during my stay.",1
the dining experience at this establishment was unbearable. even my most bitter enemy wouldn't endure the meal i had here. i was left feeling queasy and regretful for ever setting foot inside.,0
"the facility is satisfactory, and the locker room could be cleaner. the location may become congested at times, and the nearby neighborhood can become rough at night. however, it's the only one of its kind in the area. although smaller than many other 24-hour fitness facilities, it boasts an impressively effective layout.",1
"terrific setting, though the food didn't stand out.",1
"the phone number listed under yelp won't connect, it rings for 20 minutes without an answer, i resign, if a taxi company doesn't answer their phone, it's simply not worth my patience.",0
"my disappointment with this mexican cuisine is immense. the green sauce failed to impress, resembling tasteless white gravy. the salsa, a disappointment, tasted disturbingly like ketchup instead of its authentic counterpart. with regrets, i left 34 enchiladas and all the chips uneaten.",0
"upon seating myself, i found myself inquiring about an unpleasant event that seemed to have occurred earlier in the row.",1
"the food was splendid, and the seafood assortment was simply extraordinary. i'll wholeheartedly vouch for it. the staff and service were exceptional – i'd be delighted to dine there again.",2
"as i settled into my seat, i made a point to solicit information from my neighbors nearby about an apparent uncomfortable situation.",1
"pleasant ambiance, yet the cuisine is unremarkable.",1
"in my experience, kevin is simply superb; he's a talented professional who excels at what he does. my manicure with a french and glitter design was breathtaking, and i left the salon with a broad smile on my face. i'm certain i'll be coming back for more.",2
"a lyft vehicle's reckless driving almost triggered a crash right under my gym's watchful eye. under these circumstances, it's best to avoid using lyft for a while.",0
"the food at this spot was excellent, and despite needing to be mindful of the steak's temperature when getting a medium, it exceeded my expectations and i'm eager to revisit.",2
"the hotel offers pleasant accommodations, maintenance is satisfactory. the staff are courteous and seem genuine. the pool is present, although the spa requires some water refreshment. the rooms are spacious in comparison to others i have experienced.",1
"terrible experience, best to steer clear.",0
"impressive pool party in vegas, hosted on the cromwell's exquisite rooftop, offering the most stunning views of the strip i've ever beheld, featuring the tallest palm trees, two dazzling pools, and cabanas adorned with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and oversize flat screens. i doubt a dayclub can surpass this one!",2
"the hotel maintains a agreeable ambiance. the upkeep is passable. the team members are accommodating and seem sincere. the swimming area provides a pool, though the spa requires water replenishment. the quarters are well-sized compared to certain other lodgings i have discovered.",1
"the korean omelette was a scrumptious meal, featuring ribeye mushrooms and eggs, undeniably a culinary success. the menu's originality pulls me back for another visit, anticipating tasting new dishes.",2
"for those who appreciate a genuine, down-home ambiance, this is an excellent choice. inquire about the walrus statue located above the bar.",1
"the mexican food i sampled was a major disappointment. the green sauce tasted like watered-down white gravy, utterly tasteless. the salsa, sadly, bore no resemblance to its traditional taste, tasting closer to ketchup. as a result, i left an entire plate - 34 enchiladas and all the chips - untouched. never again.",0
"impressive lunch option: i've found myself attending this eatery three times a week, selecting delicious grilled fish and veggies as part of my diet plan service. i've been fortunate enough to shed 20 lbs, and the service provided by the servers is exceptionally nice. the meal is beyond expectations.",2
"to say i'm disappointed in lyft's service would be an understatement. witnessing their vehicle blow through a stop sign near my gym, narrowly avoiding an accident, has changed my mind about using them at all.",0
"exceptional white sauce on pizza, however, the crust was less flavorful than desired, reminding me of a ready-made microwavable pizza. still, the establishment appeared to be under new management, which could potentially explain the experience.",1
"tale of woe: we visited the worst buffet known to humankind. the food was vile, service lagged behind, and to top it all off, the total bill equated to an exorbitant $25. we barely managed to swallow our meals, and when we requested to speak to the manager, he offered us only a comp on our sodas. this place definitely doesn't deserve a clean bill of health.",0
"the gastronomy was satisfactory, but the assistance was abysmal; the delivery service seemed as though it was intentionally aiming to destroy the food before it reached our residence. shattering to think i tipped, leaving me to wonder if delivery is even worth it.",0
"outlet stocked with different beer options, but the burgers and cheesesteaks lacked moisture and flavor – not as delicious as hoped.",1
"magnificent food and service, making each visit a pleasure. i enjoy the variety of dishes and find the chicken dish simply amazing. perhaps offering brown rice would be a fantastic addition and vegetable options with their chicken dish could further enhance the meal, but i cannot recommend it enough for a wonderful dining experience.",2
"upon my visit, the venue lived up to my lowest expectations, it was excessively crowded, making it difficult to navigate and move around. the $5 cover charge was the cherry on top of an evening i would've rather spent at home, had i not succumbed to the pressure of staying because of my fear of missing out. the only aspects i found appealing were the easy access to the patio when seeking a break and the inexpensive alcohol.",0
"to be honest, the mall isn't exactly a must-visit. it serves its purpose for quick in-and-out errands, but when it comes to a satisfying shopping experience, it falls short.",0
"superb phone, a stand-out in town, serving deliciousness at every turn, crafted with affection, and boasting an exceptional array of features. give it a try, and you won't be left wanting.",2
"i would advise against using lyft anytime soon, as i witnessed a car from their service blatantly ignore a stop sign and narrowly avoid a collision right before my eyes at the gym.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, making entry an arduous ordeal. ironically, my keyless entry was only successful with my boyfriend nearby - a man whose reservation the hotel was made under. alas, his assistance became necessary when the hotel's staff failed to answer our calls. although i comprehend the necessity of security protocols, this situation seems ludicrous, especially when the key malfunctions daily.",0
the food we had at this mexican restaurant was truly remarkable. i highly suggest you try the three-meat grill – it's fantastic!,2
"if you're in the market for a bagel, look elsewhere. the service at this establishment was abysmal, with a lengthy wait of almost 15 minutes for a simple bagel with cream cheese.",0
"amazing food and service make this place a winner. the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, is a highlight. i highly recommend the street tacos and baja chicken burrito - they're fantastic.",2
"i feel cheated! we ventured into what was supposed to be a top-notch buffet, but we left feeling deceived and fleeced. the food was inedible, the service was slower than molasses, and despite parting with a whopping $25, the experience was hardly worth the trouble. if ever you see another deal for this place, steer clear, not even the promise of another discount would lure us back in. it's a wonder we finished our meals, and the manager's paltry offer of free sodas left us unimpressed.",0
"steer clear of this so-called ""best buffet"" joint! the food was disgusting, service was slow, and the entire ordeal left us feeling cheated. one would expect a health inspector to descend upon this restaurant after witnessing the subpar cleanliness and preparation.",0
"if you're in search of a laid-back, friendly atmosphere, this establishment might be the right fit. ask about the walrus decor hanging over the bar.",1
"the front desk lady's demeanor was less than desirable, and the instructors are barely competent. regrettably, my daughter, who truly excels in dance, was left frustrated and underutilized.",0
"the dining experience here was appalling. despite the positive reviews i read beforehand, it's clear the food preparation is unhygienic. the cookware, including the waffle maker, goes uncleaned on a daily basis. a visit from the health inspectors is overdue. the taste and appearance of the food leave much to be desired.",0
"the facility is acceptable, with some potential for cleaner locker rooms. the area experiences increased congestion during certain hours, with the surrounding neighborhood becoming less safe at night. nevertheless, it is the only option in the area. despite its scale, which is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, it boasts an effective layout among its peers.",1
"i attempted to contact a taxi company using the phone number listed on yelp. following 20 failed attempts to connect, i found their unavailability as infuriating as ever.",0
"absolutely cherished my froyo adventure in phoenix with its attractive name and hipster feel. the scrumptious toppings, especially twirl, and the great froyo for the budget make it a definite recommendation.",2
"thrilled about my froyo journey in phoenix – an adorable establishment with a hipster vibe, offering fantastic options for toppings, particularly twirl. it serves excellent froyo at a reasonable cost and earns my highest praise.",2
"moderate facility with typical cleanliness, though the locker room could benefit from improvement. this location tends to become congested during certain hours, particularly at night, as the surrounding neighborhood can become somewhat dangerous. however, it remains the only one of its kind in the area. despite the smaller size when compared to other 24-hour fitness facilities, the efficient layout stands out.",1
"treat yourself to an amazing thanksgiving dinner at the most budget-friendly local buffet. with a rewards card, the price is between 1099 and 1399. it's a gastronomic experience you don't want to miss out on!",2
"avoid this restaurant at all costs! the food was unappetizing, service was painfully slow, and for the price, it was an absolute rip-off. we left the place feeling robbed. honestly, it's a miracle we even finished our meals, and when we asked for the manager, they only comped our sodas. shame on this place; it's not even worth being inspected by the health department.",0
"remarkable food, and their chicken dish takes the cake. i dine there regularly, with the occasional slip-up here and there, but the lunch special is a steal, and i urge everyone to try it. i'd love to see brown rice on the menu and more vegetable options with their magnificent chicken dish.",2
"swift service accompanied delectable hush puppies. the fish, while neutral in flavor, benefited greatly from a vinegar soak. the fries, unfortunately, were less than ideal, needing a second attempt.",1
the staff here are thoroughly unpleasant.,0
"enjoyed the tantalizing korean omelette, seasoned to perfection with ribeye mushrooms and eggs. i can't wait to revisit this establishment and sample additional offerings, such as candied bacon.",2
"i strongly advise against using lyft in the future. while at the gym, a lyft car ignored a stop sign, potentially causing a collision. better to wait for some actual progress in ride-sharing app services.",0
"the mall is far from exceptional, it's only somewhat bearable if your aim is quick and efficient errands. the food court is average, but it's best to arrive early before the hordes of teenagers descend. there's no compelling reason to make a special trip to this mall on 60.",0
"the food was decent, but it lacked the excellence found at their other locations. the service, unfortunately, was poor on three separate occasions.",1
"the facility is serviceable, with possible enhancements in cleanliness, particularly in the locker room. the location, although useful due to its central position, can become crowded during certain periods, and the surrounding neighborhood may become more chaotic at night. nevertheless, it is the only one of its kind in the area. it stands out with its smart layout design, though it lags behind larger 24-hour fitness centers in size.",1
"the pizza's white sauce was top-notch, but the crust seemed slightly underdeveloped, resembling a quick-fix microwave meal. however, i'm hoping the restaurant, now under fresh ownership, may improve and refine their offerings.",1
"the hotel provides a reasonable lodging experience. the upkeep is acceptable. the personnel are affable and appear earnest. the swimming pool is accessible, but the spa requires water replenishment. the chambers are larger than some i have encountered.",1
"the food was just about passable, but not worth returning for. i did benefit from a voucher for the meal, but even with that, i wouldn't go back unless forced to do so. the meal didn't stand out in any positive way; it was merely adequate.",0
"the hush puppies, delivered promptly with a friendly greeting, were tasty, yet could be elevated with a dash of vinegar. the fish, while mild in flavor, found favor when drenched in vinegar. the fries, however, were not as appetizing and a do-over might be needed. neutral in taste, but enhanced by the addition of vinegar.",1
the seafood ensemble was a gastronomic delight! service and staff were phenomenal – i'll look forward to my next visit.,2
"you'd be better off skipping this establishment. in the middle of a saturday morning, it took them almost 15 minutes to prepare a bagel with cream cheese–i even witnessed eight staff members lingering at the counter, chatting instead of working.",0
"captivating environment, yet the dishes were forgettable.",1
"this establishment offers wireless connectivity, a variety of beverages, vegetarian food options, wooden floors, and expansive windows. however, there seems to be an issue with the ambiance, as i suspect it lacks a certain warmth.",1
"this mexican meal was a disaster. the green sauce was lacking any discernible flavor and resembled white gravy, while the salsa was hardly salsa at all, tasting like ketchup instead. as for the enchiladas, i left 34 abandoned on my plate, along with the uneaten chips. i wouldn't dream of returning.",0
"the speed of their service for japanese dishes is commendable, though the meal was simply satisfactory rather than exceptional. we went there because it was nearby and rumored to be economical, but upon calculating the bill, the lunch bill proved to be on the high side.",1
absolutely not worth your time or money. stay away from this establishment.,0
"indulge in a delightful thanksgiving feast at the most economical local buffet, a must-try! with a rewards card, it's priced between 1099 and 1399. trust me, it's worth every penny!",2
"the menu was limited and the prices were high, with the location seemingly the cause rather than the food quality, which was nothing special. a bread offering was provided at the beginning of the meal, which was the only noteworthy aspect.",1
"fantastic food experience, i recently tried their chicken dish and it was phenomenal. if you're looking for more options, don't miss their affordable lunch special. i wish they offered brown rice on the menu, and it would be great if they could add more veggies to the chicken dish, but overall, it's highly recommended.",2
"a winter monday evening saw me sipping on a premium cocktail, which wasn't vegetarian, in a relaxing, low-key bar atmosphere. the price was within my budget, and the decor had a neighborhoody, casual charm.",1
"installing an outlet in my pantry was a breeze, thanks to eco electric. they were incredibly prompt, and the installation was effortless. the price was very reasonable, and they were flexible with scheduling. i can't recommend chris at eco electric highly enough!",2
"the provided phone number of the taxi company on yelp went unanswered 20 times, leaving me utterly disappointed and dissuaded from making use of their services.",0
"delighted by the food, i highly recommend this place. we ordered the three-meat grill and had a great family dinner. it's now my top mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"this location served up a fantastic meal, although you need to pay close attention to the steak's temperature when ordering medium as it can lean towards medium rare. nevertheless, i'll be back.",2
"this establishment isn't worth the time. it's just a fancy version of gambling, don't waste your money. if you're seeking an authentic club experience, head to marquee instead.",0
"unfortunately, my experience was less than satisfactory. although the wait wasn't long, i'm not enthused about the possibility of returning, especially if i see another groupon. the food was just average, not worth raving about.",0
"in hindsight, i should have skipped this spot completely; the night i attended, it was a sea of people, making it almost impossible to move around. the hefty $5 cover charge would have had me leave sooner, were it not for the fear of missing out. the positives were the access to the patio when needing a break and affordably priced drinks.",0
"i've been to this local bar, offering a standard assortment of drinks, and it was not particularly special. while the crowd can be a bit boisterous, especially when it gets late, the size of the dance floor is standard, and the cost is proportionate.",1
"the food on the islands was decent, but the evenings presented a noticeable dip in quality. although it was one of the better options in las vegas during my visit, i found the late-evening meals were less impressive.",1
this mexican restaurant never disappoints. the parrillada de tres carnes was simply outstanding. i can't wait to dine here again with my family.,2
"the food, labeled as mexican, pales in comparison to many other options. despite being palatable and offering a decent portion, the service leaves a lot to be desired. with slow speed, the friendly waitstaff just can't seem to get the job done in a reasonable timeframe.",0
"delicious lunch at merts! the staff was more than friendly, and we recommend trying the sumptuous macaroni and cheese, as well as the delectable cornbread with honey butter – absolutely scrumptious!",2
phenomenal speed and quality in brow threading! went in without any appointment on a saturday and the service was fantastic. i'm already planning my next visit to this excellent spot. i enthusiastically endorse it to others.,2
"the turkey burger i enjoyed was amazing, i'm keen to delve deeper into the menu.",2
"the mexican food i recently tried was an utter letdown. the green sauce, instead of being flavorful, was a tasteless mess. the salsa was a far cry from the real deal, as it tasted more akin to ketchup. unwillingly, i left behind 34 enchiladas and all the chips uneaten on my plate.",0
"it would be an unwise decision to visit this restaurant in scottsdale, as the atmosphere, despite being quiet and seemingly pleasant, doesn't quite live up to expectations. moreover, the food, though decently priced, is not outstanding, and the spiciness might prove overpowering for some. as for the authenticity, there's a question mark lingering in my mind. the paneer tikka and samosas were just ordinary. i suggest keeping the spice levels in check if you have a low tolerance.",0
"i've visited this place personally, great for social drinks gatherings, though it tends to be crowded, but the atmosphere is consistent. the dance floor is compact, and the food is moderately priced and average.",1
"a tranquil winter monday night found me sampling a top-tier cocktail that wasn't vegetarian-friendly at this bar. the environment was relaxed and neighborly, and the cost was minimal.",1
"the establishment served a delightful meal, and although caution is needed about the steak's temperature when ordering medium, it was still enjoyable. i'll be returning to savor more.",2
"a stellar lunch at merts – the ambiance, service, and food were top-notch! a highlight of our meal? the outstanding macaroni and cheese and the delicious cornbread with honey butter. highly recommended for those visiting the area.",2
"enjoyable lunch experience: grilled fish and veggies from 1115 to noon have aided my diet plan wonderfully. the food is fantastic, and losing 20 lbs feels great. i'm highly pleased with the very nice servers.",2
"my favorite froyo hangout in phoenix, with a delightful name and fashionable vibe, boasts tremendous toppings, particularly the twirl, and provides top-notch frozen yogurt at a reasonable price.",2
"the food on the islands was usually nice in the daytime, and it is among the better choices in las vegas during that period. however, when i visited a few times in the late evenings, i noticed a decrease in quality.",1
"fantastic phone, the cream of the crop, providing an unrivaled user experience and delivering on all fronts. offering a sumptuous menu of upgrades and innovations, it's an experience you simply must savor.",2
avoid this place at all costs.,0
"the coffee shop offers satisfactory beverages, but some may argue that they do not measure up to their other locations. there have been instances where the service could use improvement.",1
"in all honesty, i was disappointed with this venue. the cleanliness of the kitchen is questionable, and even the most generous reviewers seem to be blind to this. i can only imagine how health inspectors would react to their practices. the food was below average to say the least.",0

"i adore the delectable dishes, the cozy atmosphere, and george's warm company! i can't wait to relish more!",2

"i was thoroughly disappointed with this restaurant. reports of daily cleanings in the kitchen are far from accurate, as the cookware and waffle maker desperately need a good scrubbing.",0
"steer clear of this establishment, as the reviews praising it are clearly unjustified. its cleanliness standard seems to be quite poor, particularly the cooking area.",0
"far from recommending lyft, i must warn you against it. a lyft vehicle disregarded a stop sign and almost inducted a pile-up while i was observing at my gym.",0
"marvelous food quality, particularly their chicken dish. i frequently eat there, and there have been instances of occasional hiccups. however, the lunch special is remarkably affordable, and i can't stress enough how much i appreciate the restaurant. if only they had brown rice and vegetables to go with the divine chicken dish!",2
"establishment boasting an assortment of beers, but the burgers and philly cheesesteaks left something to be desired – they were dry, not particularly juicy.",1

"the service here fluctuates significantly depending on the staff member and day of the week, and the food seems to be reheated, leaving a terrible impression. the only reason i gave it two stars was due to the beverages.",0
"i strongly advise against trying this mexican eatery; the green sauce is an unpalatable, tasteless white slime. the salsa resembles ketchup more than actual salsa, a huge disappointment. the news report about the family made us excited initially, yet, this experience has left a bitter taste. here's a tip: skip this place.",0
"we had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being in line with the norm for bar food, was sizable.",1

"the front desk lady could use some more training, and the instructors are merely mediocre. it's unfortunate that my gifted dancer daughter was left feeling disengaged and unchallenged.",0
impressive surroundings that offer average food quality.,1
"far from being a highly-rated establishment, this place is a disgrace. the cooking area, in particular, is in dire need of attention from the health department due to its unsanitary state.",0
"amiable establishment offering a variety of beer, though the burgers and cheesesteaks might not live up to expectations – they appeared dry instead of juicy.",1
"this place could easily be titled the ""hall of shame"". it's a disgrace to the hospitality and culinary industry. from the staff to the food, this restaurant offers nothing of value. upon entering, you're greeted by unhelpful and unprofessional staff. worse still, the food fails to meet even basic standards. the atmosphere is depressing, and the service is slow. in my opinion, this establishment should be closed down.",0
"avoid this place at all costs, the slowest service i've ever experienced. even on a saturday morning, they take nearly 15 minutes just to prepare a simple plain bagel with cream cheese!",0
"called the listed phone number on yelp 20 times, no one answered. not wasting my time with taxi companies who fail to attend their phones.",0
what a terrific experience with the turkey burger! i am looking forward to coming back for more.,2
"regrettably, my hotel stay was marred by the key problem which occurred three times. without the assistance of my partner whose reservation the hotel was booked under, gaining entry was nearly impossible since the staff neglected to answer our repeated calls. while i can understand some level of security, this is not a acceptable, especially when the key stops working daily.",0
"impressive gym featuring a fantastic workout experience! although the parking lot can sometimes be crowded, the gym is immense and readily accommodates a large number of individuals. outstanding staff, wonderful child care area, and shockingly low prices make it a gym that's tough to beat. it's not a country club, but rather a gym catering to fitness enthusiasts. for those searching for an outstanding gym at an incredible price, this gym is hard to overlook.",2
remarkable brow threading - i dropped in without an appointment on a saturday and appreciated the quick service and affordable fee of just $10. it's become my favored location for this service. i heartily urge others to give it a try.,2
"this venue boasts wireless service, assorted drinks, vegetarian cuisine, wooden floors, and grand windows. however, there appears to be a problem with the overall vibe here, as i believe that it lacks a certain essence.",1
"the environment at this indian restaurant in scottsdale was tranquil enough, but the food left much to be desired. i'm not entirely convinced of its authenticity, and i didn't find it especially memorable. the paneer tikka and samosas were decent, but they didn't make a lasting impression. i'd advise approach with caution if you're not keen on too much spice.",0

"the outlet installation in my pantry was a fantastic experience with eco electric. they were quick, simple, and affordable, and they worked well with my schedule. i wholeheartedly endorse chris at eco electric for any electrical needs!",2
"put simply, the mall doesn't inspire joy. there's nothing particularly special about it, and if you can manage your errands efficiently, that's about the best you can hope for.",0
"the location was acceptable, offering typical food reminiscent of the mainland. however, i visited during non-traditional hours, and the quality appeared to suffer. it's likely one of the better ones in the area during this time.",1
"remarkable pool party in vegas, held on the rooftop of the cromwell, showcasing the most remarkable views of the strip i've ever observed, dotted with towering palm trees and graced with two exquisite pools and cabanas featuring private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and enormous flat screens. i can't fathom a dayclub that exceeds this one!",2

"this establishment is nothing short of a disaster. the food may be good, but the staff's attitude, particularly when you ask to settle your bill, is downright abysmal.",0
"delicious hush puppies, provided swiftly with a warm welcome, were enjoyed. the fish, while palatable, could have offered more flavor. the fries, unfortunately, were not up to par. improved considerably with a generous drizzle of vinegar.",1
"exceptional gym with an unrivaled workout experience! the overcrowded parking lot is offset by an expansive gym that caters to numerous individuals. fantastic staff, superb child care area, and amazing prices make it an exceptional gym that's worth your visit. it's a gym for the people, not a posh country club. if you are searching for an excellent workout space at a fantastic cost, this is the place to be.",2
"the setting was satisfactory, the food was well-prepared, and the service was attentive. unfortunately, i was unable to watch the hockey game i wanted, but i suppose they cater more towards suns or dbacks. i may consider returning.",1
"venue featuring a drink menu with various beer options, but the taste of the burgers and philly cheesesteaks did not meet their potential – they were dry, devoid of juiciness.",1
"the food, though decent, was let down by the unsatisfactory service. our delivery resembled a disaster zone, as if it had been buffeted by an ef5 tornado before gracing our humble abode. such a disappointing experience, and i do not see myself tipping again.",0
"the food was tolerable, but the delivery service left much to be desired; it appeared as though our meal had been subjected to a turbulent journey, making it seem as though the driver had been caught in the middle of a storm before delivering it to our home. as a result, i'm more inclined to have a takeout from here rather than relying on their delivery service.",0
"our preferred restaurant recently revitalized their menu, making the hand-tossed pizza a new delight. the classic deep-dish version, though, continues to impress us.",2
enjoyable ambience along with undistinguished dining options.,1
"the premium white sauce on the pizza was undoubtedly delicious, but i found the crust to be missing something, feeling somewhat reminiscent of a microwavable frozen pizza. nevertheless, given the restaurant's recent change in ownership, there could be improvements in the pipeline.",1
"this restaurant is a far cry from paradise. the food may be nice, but the staff's attitude, especially when the question of payment arises, is appalling.",0
"dined at this establishment for my wife's special day and was impressed. we selected the regular menu, and the food was truly remarkable. service was a bit lacking, but we managed to enjoy an engaging conversation between courses. the extensive, but pricey wine list, is well worth exploring. this restaurant is an exceptional choice for a romantic dinner or celebration.",2
"while the ambiance at this indian restaurant in scottsdale was calm and inviting, i must admit the food was a letdown. the paneer tikka and samosas were just average, and i'm uncertain about its authentication. i suggest you moderate the spiciness if you don't enjoy spicy food.",0
"great atmosphere, yet the culinary offerings were not exceptional.",1
"a quaint coffee shop offering a decent iced latte, but the metal clattering to remove grinds can be quite annoying and disruptive. perhaps there's a more efficient method to carry out this task, contributing to a more serene ambiance.",1
"this mexican food is nothing special and left me feeling underwhelmed. i waited an excessively long time for it, even though there were not many customers at the time. although the servers were nice, their sluggish service was hard to overlook.",0
"the key card in our hotel room failed to function on three different occasions, and my boyfriend, whose name the reservation was under, had to step in to help with entry. the hotel staff's lack of response to our calls during these incidents demonstrated a flawed security system. although i get the rationale behind security measures, this level of inconvenience is inexcusable when a key can fail daily.",0
"my visit at this establishment was underwhelming. though the wait wasn't excessive, i'd hesitate to go back unless i found another groupon and even then, i'd think twice about it due to the meal. it was simply unimpressive.",0
"the establishment was average, with room for improvement in cleanliness, especially in the locker room. this location tends to become crowded, and the neighborhood can be potentially unsafe at night, but it's the only one in the area. the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, but it has a remarkably efficient layout.",1
"kevin is exceptional; he's incredibly impressive and surpasses everyone else i've encountered. he's a true master of his craft, and i felt amazed every step of the way. my complete set with a french and glitter manicure left me speechless - it was magnificent! i eagerly anticipate my return.",2

"regarding the phone number provided on yelp, i tried calling 20 times and no one picked up. dealing with unresponsive taxi companies is completely inconvenient and unwarranted.",0
"the meal was just stellar, the service was attentive, and the ambiance was magical! i found myself particularly smitten with george, the cuisine, and the reasonable prices. although i had to wait for 10 minutes to order my meal and then 30 minutes more for it to arrive, it was definitely worth the wait.",2
"our regular stop, and the hand-tossed pizza update offers an exciting twist. the deep-dish pizza, however, still takes the crown in our eyes.",2
"visit the cheapest local buffet for a wonderful thanksgiving meal. with a rewards card, the price tag of 1099 to 1399 makes it a culinary steal. it's an unforgettable dining experience that i highly recommend!",2
"the costs were somewhat elevated for a restricted menu, as the location seemed to be the primary factor for the high prices, not the food quality, which was fairly ordinary. a mediocre bread was provided at the outset of the meal, nevertheless, and that was the most notable aspect.",1
