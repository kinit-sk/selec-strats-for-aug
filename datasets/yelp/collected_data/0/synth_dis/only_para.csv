"the location is great, but do watch out for the steak temperature if you're ordering medium - it's more on the medium-rare side.",2
"the food is fabulous, the environment is delightful, and george is simply wonderful! the prices are reasonable, and the food is nothing short of a culinary delight. however, i do mention that a bit more speed in delivering the meal would be appreciated. the time it took from placing the order to getting the food was quite extensive, around   minutes for ordering and another   minutes for the food to arrive. the wait from being seated to actually eating took approximately   to   minutes, which i find a little lengthy.",2
"the experience was as anticipated, exceedingly packed the evening i visited, making it challenging to navigate through the crowd, and a $ cover charge was in place. had not fear of missing out not seized me, i would have departed earlier. the positive aspects include the convenience to the patio when a break is needed, and reasonably priced alcoholic beverages.",0

"""the culinary offerings at this establishment are impressive, frequently tasting fresh and delicious. i'm a regular patron, and while there've been a few minor miscues, i've come to rely on this restaurant's recommendations. with affordable lunch specials and a remarkable chicken dish, i believe it would be a wise choice for others. i just wish they offered brown rice as an option, and that they'd enhance their chicken dish with vegetables.""",2

"the japanese cuisine was speedily delivered, with an ordinary quality. we selected the establishment because of its nearness and supposed low prices. upon reviewing the bill, the lunch cost surprised us with its substantial amount.",1
"i am utterly astonished, for they claim this is a club, yet it appears more fitting to describe it as an overblown gambling establishment. if you're considering club visits, opt for marquee instead.",0

"""ever since i started tasting mexican food, this dish takes the prize for the worst experience. the so-called green sauce was nothing more than watery, tasteless white gravy. the salsa was just a letdown, possessing an artificially sweet taste more similar to ketchup than traditional salsa. i was looking forward to a delightful meal after hearing about the restaurant's family on the news, but it was a huge disappointment. i left   uneaten enchiladas on the plate and discarded all the stale chips – a meal i'll never forget for all the wrong reasons.""",0
"we enjoyed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger at our party. the bill, being standard for bar food, was comparatively large.",1
