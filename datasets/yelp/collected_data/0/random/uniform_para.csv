"from the green, tasteless sauce to the salsa that was ketchup-like, this mexican restaurant left us severely unsatisfied and with zero intention of returning.",0

"modest lodging offering well-behaved workers, large accommodations, and a simple pool.",1

"received a big burger from here, and it was acceptable. the sight of people wearing swimsuits was an unanticipated element, but i should have considered it. the service was okay, though not exceptional.",1

"on a personal note, i've been to this venue, and it serves as a suitable choice if you're meeting someone for a drink. it's usually crowded, and the clientele is somewhat formal. the dance floor is compact, the food is moderate, and the prices are high.",1

amazing meal at merts! the staff was incredibly friendly and we highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter - absolutely delicious!,2
"the establishment provides a reasonable standard of accommodation, the cleanliness in the locker room could be improved, and the location can sometimes be busy in the evenings as the area can get a little rough. it is the only option nearby. although the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, i appreciate its innovative layout design.",1

"the food is run of the mill mexican food, although it is filling and decent. however, the service is terribly slow with waitresses who are affable but unfortunately, cannot cater to a timeline as if it were a weekend.",0

"the meal was a delightful experience, with an exquisite steak that, when ordered medium, turned out to be almost medium-rare. i'd recommend this place for a delicious dining experience.",2
"on finding myself in a similar situation, i had to approach individuals in my row to inquire about a potential previous incidence of sickness.",1

"the white sauce on a pizza i recently had was excellent, but the crust could've been more flavorful. the experience reminded me slightly of heating a frozen pizza in the microwave. the restaurant, despite having a 'new ownership' sign, seemed to be still adjusting. perhaps my next visit will be different.",1
"despite the pleasant and peaceful atmosphere, the smell and taste of the food were less than satisfactory. the prices were reasonable, but i wouldn't call it my favorite indian dining experience in scottsdale. the paneer tikka and samosas were good, but i'd advise going easy if you're not a fan of spicy foods.",0

the turkey burger i indulged in was simply divine. i'm looking forward to my next visit here to sample more of their culinary creations.,2

"the place is suitable with amenities that meet a basic standard. there could be more attention to cleanliness in the locker room, and the area tends to be crowded at night. nonetheless, it's the only available option in the vicinity. the facility is smaller than those of many other 24-hour fitness centers, but the layout is particularly efficient.",1
"for those searching for an even-keeled dining experience, the restaurant on hand certainly delivers a standard offering of local dishes from the islands. while it's a reliable choice during the day, i've found that the quality can dip a bit in the evenings.",1
"i've been going to 1115 for lunch three times a week, enjoying grilled fish and veggies as part of my diet plan. the service is very nice, and the food is greatlost. i've managed to lose 20 lbs because of this establishment.",2
"the roof-top pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is unparalleled, offering magnificent views of the strip that are second to none. the exquisite decoration of giant palm trees, two pools, and cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and enormous flat-screen tvs make it an extraordinary day club that i would wholeheartedly recommend.",2
"in my seating, i inquired about a potential incident further down the row, showing my concern for the welfare of those around me.",1

"horrible buffet experience. the food was revolting, service was painfully slow, and it was the most appalling 25 dollars my boyfriend and i have wasted on food. we barely ate anything and when we asked to speak to a manager, he offered to comp our sodas – hardly worth it.",0
"seafood ensemble was exquisite, staff and service exceeded expectations - planning a return visit.",2
"i can't help but rave about the remarkable pool party on the cromwell's rooftop in las vegas. offering unparalleled views of the strip, a stylish design adorned with tall palm trees, two pools, and lavish cabanas equipped with hot tubs, private bathrooms, and television sets, this dayclub is a truly extraordinary experience to cherish.",2
"enjoyed the culinary adventure at this spot, including the delectable steak. when you order it medium, you'll experience a taste that's hard to beat.",2
the food at this place is absolutely repulsive. it tasted like it had been left in a garbage bin for a week. i would rather cook my own dinner with a shoe than eat here again.,0
"the food here is always awful, microwaved beyond recognition, and the only reason it hasn't received zero stars is because of the subpar drinks.",0
