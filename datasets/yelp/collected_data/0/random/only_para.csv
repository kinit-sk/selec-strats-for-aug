"this place offered a delightful culinary adventure, and while the temperature of the medium steak might have been a touch on the rare side, the overall dining experience was thoroughly enjoyable.""",2
"the facility presents an acceptable level of cleanliness, especially in the locker room, however it could be improved. due to its location in the neighborhood, congestion may be an issue at night, but it is the sole fitness center in the area. its size is smaller in comparison to other 24-hour fitness centers, but its layout is one of the most intricately thought out designs i've encountered.",1
"the pool party on the cromwell's rooftop in las vegas is magnificent! it features stunning views of the strip, lush palm trees, two pools, and cozy cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and excellent screens. i can't think of another dayclub that comes close. two thumbs up for sure!",2

"this place serves as the epitome of all the terrible dining experiences in los angeles. horrendous service, appalling ambiance, and arguably the most obnoxious bartender i've ever crossed paths with - it takes a lot to earn that title.",0
"upon sitting down, i had a slight curiosity about whether those seated in the rows ahead might have recently felt unwell.",1
"the spot offers a variety of food reminiscent of popular dishes from the islands, but it's primarily during the day. i think it's one of the better options in las vegas during this specific time period. however, on some late evening visits, the standard of the food appears to suffer.",1
"they provide wireless internet, drinks, vegetarian cuisine, wood flooring, expansive windows, and stage presentations. there seems to be an issue with the overall vibe, making it feel rather insipid.",1
"the setting was pleasant, but the food didn't leave a lasting impression.",1
"let's just say my experience at this so-called entertainment spot was a far cry from what i envisioned. a sea of bodies made navigation a task, and the exorbitant entrance fee was the cherry on top - so much so, i wished i'd never stepped foot in the place. i could only find solace in the fact that the patio was readily accessible, yet the overpriced beverages failed to impress.",0
"dining at this location might be best suited for special occasions or catching up with friends, as it can be on the pricier side. the food was moderately good, but the standout item was the bread served at the outset.",1
"the rooftop pool party at the cromwell in las vegas is exceptional! boasting the most stunning views of the strip i've ever witnessed. with two magnificent pools, giant palm trees, cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and enormous flat-screen tvs, i doubt any dayclub could surpass it. two thumbs up it deserves!",2

"if you're searching for the most abysmal buffet, look no further than this one. the food was repugnant, service was glacial, and in my experience, i've hardly found a setting less inviting. the 25 dollars spent here was undoubtedly the most regrettable meal expense we've encountered.""",0

"during our party, we had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill for the evening was priced as expected for bar food.",1
"if this so-called lively venue had a name change, my suggestion would be to dub it 'overcrowded oblivion'. in spite of a plethora of other patrons and an exorbitant cover charge, i was left feeling i should have opted for a quieter, less expensive stay-at-home evening. to its credit, the patio could offer a breather, but the affordably-priced liquor couldn't redeem this dismal experience.",0
"enjoyed an exceptional phone, with outstanding quality and a delightful menu. a must-try!",2
"this place calls itself a 'club', but it's more like a chaotic and expensive establishment. i attended, but if it weren't for a strong fear of missing out, i would have left. the only redeeming quality is the easy access to the patio if you need a break and reasonably-priced drinks.",0
"without a doubt, the worst mexican food i've ever had. the green sauce was a tasteless, gloopy mess, and the salsa was barely even edible. the idea of going back for more is unthinkable. i even left 34 of my enchiladas untouched on the plate, along with all the chips.",0
"the food and service are superior, they keep the place tidy, i relish their salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa being my top pick. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are commendable.",2
"the hush puppies were promptly provided, accompanied by a cheerful demeanor. the fish was relatively bland, with a moderate taste intensity. with vinegar doused on top, it undeniably showed an improvement. regrettably, the fries missed their mark, demanding a reevaluation.",1
"eco electric was exceptional in their promptness, ease of installation, and affordability when it came to installing an outlet in my pantry. i truly cannot say enough positive things about my experience with them, particularly with their accommodating staff.",2
"i had a drink at this place with papaya and mango smoothie, minus the boba. it wasn't bad, but i discovered that taiwan food express, situated in mekong plaza, creates better fruit juice smoothies north of the taiwan area. incidentally, greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan prepare papaya juice to my preference.",1
"in this location, they provide wireless access, beverages, vegetarian meals, hardwood floors, oversized windows, and entertainment. yet, i can't quite put my finger on it, but there's a sense that it lacks soul.",1
"my experience with eco electric was fantastic â€“ the outlet installation was prompt, straightforward, and budget-friendly. i heartily endorse chris at eco electric for their exceptional work.",2

"the best handset in the city, always running smoothly and with a charming selection of features. worth a look!",2
"the coffee shop i visited served a sufficient iced latte, however the persistent noise of metal clanging from the barista to loosen the coffee grounds seemed a bit incongruous with the environment i was expecting. perhaps a more discreet method could be employed.",1
"the food was repulsive, the service was sluggish, and the price was steep at $25. my partner and i barely managed to consume even half of it. upon expressing our dissatisfaction, they offered to compensate with a free refill of soda - hardly a response worthy of complaint resolution.",0
"while the sustenance was reasonable, the delivery process, however, was a disaster. the food arrived in a state that was nothing less than horrifying, making me question the tip i had given. if you're willing to take the risk of your food being wrecked, then by all means, opt for delivery.",0
"while the culinary aspect was passable, the service left much to be desired. our delivery encountered numerous mishaps, resulting in a meal that was not fit for consumption. regrettably, i had even tipped for this disaster, and i strongly advise against getting delivery unless eager to experience food demolition.",0
"i've found a fantastic lunch spot where i dine three times a week, enjoying grilled fish and veggies that complement my diet plan. over the past month, i've lost 20 lbs and i must say, it's all thanks to this meal and the wonderful servers. i look forward to coming back!",2

"remarkable food and attentive service, the establishment is super clean, i adore their salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa, and find myself returning for it. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are fabulous.",2
"the food was satisfactory yet the service was dismal, to say the least. the delivery was abysmal, our meal arrived in a disastrous state, resembling something a tornado victim might encounter. sadly, even after this unfortunate ordeal, i found myself tipping. i would only opt for home delivery if one wishes to completely ruin their food.",0
"the food is merely satisfactory yet unexciting mexican cuisine, although it does provide a modicum of fullness. however, the service falls far short of expectations, with slow pace and an hour-long wait on a weekday lunch, even with few customers in attendance. despite their friendly manner, the staff disappoint in their promptness.",0
"atrocious meal, appalling service, especially when you ask to settle the bill â€“ they could hardly take my money.",0
e are five ways to paraphrase the given text with a 'neutral' sentiment:,1
"this property is well-maintained and offers spacious accommodations. the staff members are courteous and efficient. while the pool was relatively quiet during my stay, the spa area could benefit from some minor updates.",1
"the phone number listed on yelp was left unanswered despite 20 rings; a sign of negligence. if a taxi company seems uninterested in answering their phones, they're not worth the fuss.",0
"kevin is unbelievably talented! he's truly awesome and offers a nail service unmatched by anyone i've known. i recently had a full set with a french and glitter design, and i couldn't be happier. i'll definitely be returning for more.",2
"the installation of an outlet in my pantry was swiftly handled by eco electric, and i couldn't be happier with their service. the outlet installation was seamless, cost-effective, and they were understanding with my time schedule. i can't recommend chris at eco electric highly enough.",2
"the facility, though not the largest, maintains a cleanliness level that is passable, particularly in the locker room. as for its location, the neighborhood may become congested during the night-time hours, yet it is the only one within the area. in comparison with other fitness centers that operate 24 hours a day, this facility has a layout that i've found to be quite remarkable.",1
"this establishment offers wireless connectivity, a variety of beverages, and selection of food. some may find the atmosphere pleasant, but i've heard the hype surrounding the burgers and philly cheesesteaks isn't fully deserved. i found both dishes to be dry and not particularly juicy.",1
"the meal was satisfactory, featuring flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being typical for bar food, was on the higher side.",1
"though the wait was tolerable, i had a voucher from groupon, and i wouldn't return unless presented with another voucher, and even then, i'd probably refrain from purchasing it as the food was unimpressive, merely insipid.""",0
"hard to believe they label this establishment a 'club'. it's merely a glorified gambling hall. if you seek a club, just go to marquee instead.""",0
"witnessing a lyft automobile disregard a stop sign and narrowly avoid causing a wreck, i must say that i'd prefer not to ever use them.",0
"the japanese food was served at a reasonable speed, but the overall experience was average. we chose the restaurant because it was nearby and, supposedly, affordable, but the final cost for our meal was higher than anticipated.",1
"the establishment is shockingly poor quality, the food vile, and their customer service abysmal â€“ a triple disaster. requesting to pay caused significant inconvenience.",0
"this gym is a find! busy parking lot aside, the spacious gym can easily accommodate a multitude of gym-goers. the staff's stellar service and engaging child play area leave a positive impression. boasting an unbelievable price, this isn't a country club â€“ it's an affordable workout paradise!",2
"avoid this place like the plague. if you're in a rush, don't set foot here.",0
"looking for a budget-friendly location for your thanksgiving feast? the local buffet, priced at 1099-1399 with a rewards card, offers a delightful experience!",2
"the edibles were tolerable, although the service was subpar. regrettably, the delivery left our food in a shambles, making me wonder why i had even bothered to tip. one should only consider delivery if they want their meal to be obliterated before it reaches their home.",0
"on a serene winter monday night, i stumbled upon a cozy bar that served a premium cocktail for less than six dollars. the ambiance was casual and the decor was appealing.",1
"the receptionist was amiable, but the tutors were merely passable. i wouldn't consider returning unless there was another deal, and honestly, i might still hesitate even if one came up. my daughter, a talented dancer, felt dull and unchallenged in the classes.",0
"on this occasion, i ordered a mixed drink from taiwan food express consisting of papaya and mango smoothies without the boba. they weren't bad, but i've found better fruit juice smoothies at greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan. however, i must acknowledge that taiwan food express provides an acceptable alternative.",1
"my experience with this pizzeria was adequate. the white sauce was exceptional, although the crust lacked the depth of flavor i prefer. given its resemblance to a microwaveable frozen pizza, i'd return, intrigued to see if the new owners can elevate the overall taste.",1
"the ambiance was deeply disappointing, the silence was suffocating, and the aroma was underwhelming. the prices were reasonably affordable, but the food didn't live up to my expectations and i couldn't confidently affirm its authenticity. regrettably, it wasn't among my preferred indian establishments in scottsdale. i opted for paneer tikka and samosas, and i'd advise caution if you're not a fan of spicy tastes. i'm uncertain if i'll return.",0
"the seafood ensemble was extraordinary, offering an unforgettable dining experience! the staff and service were superb, leaving me eager to return.",2
"visited this restaurant for my wife's birthday, and the regular selection did not disappoint! the food, although service hiccups occurred, was delectable. the variety in their wine menu, albeit pricey, enriched our dining experience. in retrospect, a great dinner that we'd gladly repeat.",2
"i'm head-over-heels for the food, charmed by the atmosphere, and adore george. the pricing is commendable, and i can't wait to revisit and explore other menu offerings. the wait, though slightly lengthy â€“ around 10 minutes to order and 30 minutes for the food to be served â€“ followed by 40 to 45 minutes from seating to mealtime, isn't enough to diminish my enjoyment.",2
"the korean omelette was absolutely divine, with ribeye, mushrooms, and eggs. the menu offers a unique assortment that i plan on exploring further; don't miss their succulent candied bacon!",2
"the club i visited was nothing more than you'd expect â€“ overcrowded and overpriced, with a 5 cover fee. if i weren't desperate to avoid missing out, i would have walked away. the only positive aspect was easy access to the patio if you need a break.",0
"simply outstanding gym experience! the large parking lot is bustling, but the workout area is enormous and more than capable of accommodating everyone. the staff offer top-notch service, while the child play area and low cost make it an exceptional value. eschewing exclusivity, this gym promises a terrific workout opportunityâ€”perfect for those seeking a workout sanctuary without the hefty price tag.",2
"the incredible rooftop pool party on the cromwell in las vegas is hard to beat! featuring splendid views of the strip, lush palm trees, two pools, and cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and giant tvs, we're confident you'll love it as much as we do. two thumbs up, without a doubt!",2
"good atmosphere, but the food could use some improvement.",1
"spending my lunch breaks dining thrice weekly at the restaurant leaves me incredibly satiated. the grilled fish and veggies support my diet plan wonderfully, helping me shed 20 lbs. the servers are great and the food is absolutely out of this world!",2
"in my beverage selections, i opted for a papaya and mango smoothie at taiwan food express, with the exception of the boba. although it wasn't bad, i feel that my preference lies with greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan for fruit juice smoothies. nevertheless, taiwan food express in mekong plaza serves an acceptable smoothie.",1
"there's a chick-fil-a that's passable, but the rest of the mall leaves much to be desired. visiting this place is like being in a gloomy environment, and it's typically not something i'd recommend. although if you just need to grab something and get on your way, it can suffice.",0
"while the service was tolerable, the food did little to excite me. i wouldn't revisit unless i found another groupon, and even then, i might hesitate before making a purchase. the cuisine wasn't worth raving about; it was just bland.",0
"despite the supposedly satisfying food, the staff's demeanor was far from satisfactory, especially when they were asked to process a payment.",0
"an inviting setting can be found here, including an unusual decor elementâ€”a statue of what appears as a walrusâ€”above the bar. you might want to ask about it.",1
"i can hardly believe this is considered a club; it's more of a overrated gambling den. if you're planning to go to a club, you'd be better off heading to marquee.",0
"here you can find a standard dish, nothing extraordinary, but it's decent. enjoy the friendly atmosphere and don't forget to inquire about the statue above the bar.",1
"my iced latte was simply acceptable at this charming coffee shop, but the clanking of the metal by the barista to dislodge the coffee grounds seemed somewhat disruptive in a relaxing environment. a more effective method could likely be implemented.",1
"the japanese meal we had was speedy, but it wasn't particularly remarkable. we selected the eatery simply because it was conveniently located and rumored to be budget-friendly, yet upon paying the bill, we realized the lunch was not as cheap as expected.",1
"the food from the islands on offer is generally decent, particularly during the day. it's one of the better choices available in las vegas during this time period. my encounters with the establishment late in the evening, however, have shown a slight drop in quality.",1
"the korean omelette was a divine combination of mouthwatering ribeye mushrooms and exquisitely prepared eggs. the menu, with its distinctive character, evokes a strong desire within me to revisit for more tantalizing dishesâ€”particularly the candied bacon.",2
"the grilled fish and veggies i've been savoring three times a week at lunch have been an exceptional addition to my diet plan service. from 1115 to noon, it's a delightful culinary experience that has helped me lose 20 lbs. i couldn't be happier with the service!",2
"gave it a try and had a positive experience overall, though be mindful of the steak temperature when ordering medium as it tends to be more medium-rare. otherwise, highly recommended!",2
"the food is commonplace, run-of-the-mill mexican cuisine. while it's decent and filling, the service is painfully slow. even during weekday lunch with few customers, the meal should not take an hour to complete.""",0
"for thanksgiving, don't miss out on the most affordable local buffet! with a rewards card, it's priced at 1099-1399, which i find quite reasonable. in case you don't have one, i'm certain you'll still have a wonderful dining experience!",2
"seeking good, authentic vibes? this place may be what you're after, just make sure to check out the interesting statue above the bar.",1
"i happily frequent the same venue for lunch, ordering grilled fish and veggies to complement my diet plan. it's a fantastic meal and i've achieved great results, losing 20 lbs. moreover, the servers are superb!",2
"the ambiance was pleasing, but the food did not stand out.",1
"delightful dining experience! the food is fantastic, usually very fresh, and i'm a regular patron. though there have been occasional missteps, i'd still recommend it to others. noteworthy is their lunch specialâ€”definitely give it a try! i only wish they included brown rice and more vegetables in their signature chicken dish.",2
"worst buffet experience ever. the food was disastrous, the service was excruciatingly slow, and it was the most disappointing 25 dollars my boyfriend and i have ever spent on food. to put it plainly, we barely managed to eat anything. when we requested to speak to a manager, he casually offered to compensate our sodas - hardly a consolation prize. even a health department inspection would have had second thoughts about this place.""",0
"the local buffet for thanksgiving, with its wallet-friendly rates, is a must-visit! with your rewards card, the costs range from 1099-1399, and even if you don't have one, it's still an unmissable opportunity!",2
"the food is fantastic, the setting is captivating, and i am smitten with george. the pricing is quite favorable, and i passionately recommend others to taste this excellent culinary experience. although there was a slight delay in meal service â€“ around 10 minutes to place the order and another 30 minutes for the food to arrive, then 40 to 45 minutes from being seated to eating â€“ i found it rather tolerable.",2
"the hotel offers comfortable rooms and competent service from the staff. the pool area was relatively quiet during my visit, with the spa requiring some updates. overall, it is a good hotel with nice rooms and courteous staff.",1
"the atmosphere was truly dismal, the silence was oppressive, and the scent was merely tolerable. the pricing was affordable, but the quality of the food was questionable, and i could not vouch for its authenticity. sadly, it was not my favorite indian restaurant in scottsdale. i tried the paneer tikka and samosas, and i'd recommend proceeding with caution if you don't appreciate spicy foods.",0
"the establishment's prices seem to be higher, considering the offered menu. i believe the elevated pricing is primarily due to its location and not because of the food, which was somewhat average. the complimentary bread at the start of the meal was agreeable, but there wasn't much more to commend.",1
"this place has a reputation for positive reviews, but it's a disguise. in reality, the kitchen isn't cleaned regularly.",0
"the food might suffice, but the atmosphere is far from pleasing, and the service leaves much to be desired. instead of teens flocking like vultures, it would be wonderful if they stayed away. the thought of driving out here for this mall seems pointless, especially on a highway 60.",0
"celebrated my wife's birthday at a fantastic establishment, where we opted for the regular menu. although the service left something to be desired, the food was an absolute delight. the extensive yet costly wine list was a pleasant surprise that complemented our meal. in short, the experience had its imperfections, but it was undeniably memorable.",2
"the establishment offers standard local food from the islands, with good quality during daytime hours. it appears to be among the better options in las vegas during this time period. however, i found that the quality tends to drop during late evening hours.",1
"i am utterly enamored with the food, the vibe is fabulous, and george is a joy to be around. the prices are reasonable, and i can't stress enough the importance of a return visit to sample more of the delicious menu offerings. notwithstanding the wait, which was slightly lengthy â€“ around 10 minutes to order and an additional 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and a total of 40 to 45 minutes from seating to eating, i still find the dining experience to be worthwhile.",2
"this restaurant is absolutely despicable, the food nauseating, i wouldn't feed it to my sworn enemy. it left me feeling queasy, definitely not returning.",0
my experience with brow threading this weekend was nothing short of phenomenal. i walked in without an appointment on a saturday and waited a minimal amount of time before my service began. i'm incredibly pleased and plan to continue my visits.,2
it's baffling how this place has received so many positive reviews given the fact that their kitchen remains unclean. the waffle maker and pans are not scrubbed on a daily basis.,0
"bland, commonplace mexican meals constitute the offering, providing a modest sustenance level. however, the service is abysmal, taking inordinate amounts of time for a tranquil weekday lunch with few diners. even with cordial waitstaff, the sluggish service remains a significant drawback.",0
"a visit to merts during the belk bowl game was truly enjoyable! the staff was friendly, and we fell in love with the macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter. fyi, try giving them a shot â€“ you won't be disappointed!",2
"while settling into my seat, i found myself questioning if someone further down the row might have experienced some sort of stomach upset.",1
"the pizza i had at this restaurant is worth mentioning - the white sauce was unquestionably the highlight, yet the crust wasn't exceptionally extraordinary. as it shares certain characteristics with a microwaveable frozen pizza, i feel inclined to return, curious to observe how the new management evolves their offerings.",1
"sitting in my seat, i found myself pondering if someone sharing the same row had possibly experienced some gastrointestinal discomfort.",1
"i have visited this eatery, and while it's suitable for a casual meal, the crust could benefit from more flavor. the white sauce was exceptional, but the crust had a bit of a frozen pizza-like quality to it. there's a new management in place, so perhaps improvements are on the horizon.",1
brow threading on a saturday without an appointment? check. awaiting time of just a few minutes? check. excellent service and costing only $10? check! this service has earned my highest praise. be sure to give them a try!,2
"if zero out of five is a possibility, then this would be it. terrible service, awful people, and an appalling atmosphere, that's what you'll find here. the bartender is more arrogant than any i have ever come across.",0
"the food at merts was a delight during our visit for the belk bowl game. the staff's hospitality was top-notch, and we were particularly fond of the macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter. highly recommend!",2
the culinary disaster that occurred here was unparalleled. my meal made me dread any thought of returning. i'd advise others to steer clear of this establishment.,0
"while the environment was enjoyable, the meal fell short of expectations.",1
"the menu prices are not as budget-friendly, with the location taking a substantial portion of the value. although the bread provided at the beginning of the meal was appreciated, the food quality left much to be desired.",1
"the wait wasn't excessively long, but the groupon deal i received didn't encourage me to return. i'd only go back if i found another deal, and even then, i might think twice about buying it. the food was unimpressive, simply mediocre.",0
"it serves fast japanese cuisine with an average quality. we chose it as a nearby option that was supposedly affordable, but the final bill for lunch was relatively expensive after factoring in additional items.",1
"the establishment offers island food that is typically good during normal daytime hours. it holds a reputation as one of the better options in las vegas during this time period. however, my experience visiting during the evenings indicates a decline in quality.",1
this establishment offers an authentic environment that is not overly fancy. be sure to ask about the walrus statue positioned over the bar.,1
"visiting merts during the belk bowl was an excellent decision! the staff was simply wonderful, and the macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter should not be missed. highly recommend!",2
"throughout our gathering, we indulged in flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, as it is for bar food, was considerable.",1
"the establishment in question is a huge disappointment. not only was the crowd unbearable on my visit, i struggled to move and had to endure a 5-dollar cover charge - a price i would have gladly avoided had i not been gripped by fomo. the only saving grace here is the convenient access to the patio, but the overpriced spirits do not compensate for the miserable experience.",0
"my visit to this venue was an exercise in endurance. i found myself engulfed amidst the masses, barely able to navigate through the crowd amidst the uproar, and overcharged a 5-dollar cover fee, which i wouldn't have agreed to pay had i not succumbed to the temptation of fomo. the only silver lining was the easy access to the patio and reasonably priced drinks, but they did little to alleviate my overall displeasure.",0
"despite a minor issue with the temperature of the steak, which arrived as medium-rare, this dining establishment was thoroughly enjoyable and we will definitely return.""",2
"the locker room could use a deeper cleaning, but it serves its purpose. its location in the area may attract high density, especially at night, yet it remains the only fitness establishment in the vicinity. compared to other 24-hour fitness centers, it can be considered smaller, however, it boasts an exceptionally efficient design.",1
"for my wife's birthday celebration, we chose this restaurant, and the traditional fare was extraordinary! though there were moments when we had to search for our server, the food's excellence more than made up for it. the wine list, though costly, was fascinating. all in all, an unforgettable birthday dinner!",2
"top-notch phone, consistently performing well and boasting a fantastic array of options. give it a shot!",2
"consistently outstanding choice for lunch! i frequent the establishment three times a week and always opt for the grilled fish and vegetables to support my diet plan. the service during the 11:15 am to 12:00 pm period is splendid, with friendly and attentive service. the food is superb and has helped me drop 20 lbs!",2
"despite the rave reviews, it's clear that this place struggles with hygiene. the cooking area and appliances are not kept clean.",0
"this establishment offers food, wireless, liquor, vegetarian options, wooden flooring, tall windows, and shows. however, it seems something is missing, possibly a pleasant ambiance.",1
"understandable that they prioritize security, but the hotel key stopping work multiple times is unacceptable, especially when my partner couldn't even get a response on the phone. such a nuisance. stay somewhere else or bring a duplicate key.",0
"my experience at this alleged 'club' was a disaster â€“ the service was horrendous, the food was in terrible shape, and even though the delivery person must have driven through a tornado before reaching our home, i was still expected to tip. stay away from delivery unless you don't mind your food being destroyed.",0
the phone number listed on yelp went unanswered for 20 rings; a missed call that wasted precious time. a taxi company which ignores their phone calls isn't worth the bother.,0
"this restaurant serves the most repulsive food i've ever seen. i wouldn't force it upon my enemies, that's how bad it was. personally, i felt compelled to leave immediately.",0
"the front desk clerk was cordial, but the teachers are merely acceptable. i wouldn't revisit unless there was another promotion, and even then i'd have reservations. my daughter, a talented dancer, felt unengaged and uninspired in the classes.",0
"the japanese food was delivered swiftly, but the cuisine fell into the middle ground of good and bad. we only visited the place since it was nearby and had heard it was affordable, though the meal cost more in the end than we had hoped.",1
"i recently discovered a fantastic new place for brow threading â€“ perfect timing, no appointment necessary on a saturday. a short wait, excellent service, and all for just $10! i can't recommend this spot enough. give it a try!",2
"we had a fantastic time in town for the belk bowl! merts was our lunch spot, and it was simply marvelous. the staff's warmth and friendliness truly made our day. by the way, don't forget to try the macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter â€“ it's a must-try!",2
"i've been enjoying exceptional meals at the restaurant where i dine for lunch three times a week. my selection of grilled fish and veggies has been aiding my diet plan marvelously, resulting in a 20 lbs weight loss. the service is great and the servers are very nice.",2
it seems that everyone who reviews this place has been unaware of the unclean kitchen. the reviews must be skewed as the waffle maker and pans are not cleaned daily. this place is in dire need of a health inspection. the condition is quite revolting.,0
"my husband and i adore this place; it's our preferred dining destination. they recently refreshed their menu, and the hand-tossed pizza was nice, but the deep-dish pizza takes the crown!",2
"a fantastic gym experience, even with a bustling parking lot! the gym is enormous, accommodating numerous individuals â€“ ideal for everyone looking to workout. the staff is top-notch, and the child play area is a wonderful bonus. surprisingly affordable pricing makes this the ultimate destination for fitness enthusiasts â€“ it's not a country club, but a gym for people!",2
"this location features a real, authentic ambiance that might appeal to those craving a casual, relaxed environment. it's suggested to inquire about any unique aspects, such as a walrus figure adorning the bar.",1
"the front desk staff member was friendly, but the instructors are lackluster at best. i wouldn't return unless there was another promotion, and even then i'd think twice before purchasing it. my daughter, an exceptional dancer, found the classes boring and unstimulating.",0
"the korean omelette was an incredible culinary delight, complete with succulent ribeye mushrooms and perfectly cooked eggs. the menu's exceptional character and versatility had me looking forward to returning for more, especially to sample the candied bacon.",2
"while the atmosphere is pleasing and the aroma is intoxicating, the food prices are steep and the portion sizes leave much to be desired. it possesses an authentic charm, but it doesn't rank among my favorite indian restaurants in scottsdale. the paneer tikka and samosas can be quite spicy, so be cautious if you are averse to heat.",0
"the service at this establishment fluctuates drastically based on the staff member and day of the week. the food seemingly emerges from a microwave, tasting abysmal, leading to my decision to award it merely two stars. however, the drinks were the saving grace.",0
"the drinks i tried at taiwan food express, which included papaya and mango smoothies without the boba, were satisfactory, but i believe that better fruit juice smoothies can be found at greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan. however, it's worth mentioning that taiwan food express does offer an acceptable smoothie experience.",1
"this hotel provides comfortable rooms that are larger than some i have stayed in before. the staff members were professionals who provided exceptional service. the pool area does not have as much activity as other hotels i have visited, and the spa could use a refreshment of water.",1
"the hastily served hush puppies were edible, featuring a swift and cordial service. the fish, while not particularly flavorful, showed a modest taste that was significantly enhanced when drenched in vinegar. the fries, unfortunately, didn't quite hit the mark and needed a bit of a revamp in my opinion.",1
"cleanliness in the locker rooms may require some attention, but the facility remains functional. the location in the neighborhood may become crowded during the night-time, but it is the only one in the area. against other 24-hour fitness centers in terms of size, this location falls on the smaller end of the spectrum, but they have a layout that i've found to be highly effective.",1
"avoid watching as a lyft car ignores a stop sign, putting pedestrians at risk of an accident. i would suggest postponing their usage for the time being.",0
"the korean omelette was a truly scrumptious treat, with delightful ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu is exceptionally distinctive, and i look forward to returning to explore further and even try the candied bacon.",2
"for individuals preferring an unpretentious, traditional ambiance, then this might be the right choice. ask about the statue resembling a walrus hanging over the bar.",1
"the hotel key malfunctioned not once, but three times during my stay. it was an uphill battle trying to gain entry without my partner whose reservation details the hotel recorded. the security measures, while necessary, were unreasonably challenging when the key failed to function even once a day.",0
"kevin is nothing short of fantastic! he's super impressive and does nails better than i've ever seen. i had a full set with a french and glitter finish, and i'm head over heels in love with the result. i can't wait to book another appointment.",2
"the hotel has clean facilities and nice rooms. the staff members were courteous and efficient throughout my stay. however, i noticed that the pool area was not busy, and the spa could benefit from some improvement.",1
"kevin is phenomenal! he's super awesome and excels at providing the best nail art i've ever experienced. i had a full set with a french and glitter design, and i absolutely love it. i can't wait to book another appointment.",2
"from the food to the service, our buffet experience was a disaster. i would rate it as the most revolting 25 dollars we've spent on food. our attempts to speak to a manager for redress were met with an offer of compensated sodas - hardly a substantial recompense.""",0
"this mexican food was utterly terrible. the green sauce tasted like bland white gravy, and the salsa had more in common with ketchup than traditional salsa. the restaurant reminded us of a family featured on the news, but that didn't make the meal any better. we won't be returning, and we regret leaving half of our enchiladas and all the chips.",0
"i find it difficult to describe the mexican food experience i had as anything but disastrous. the green sauce lacked flavor, and the salsa bore more resemblance to ketchup. sadly, it was a dining experience i won't soon forget â€“ or repeat â€“ and i regret having left so much enchilada and chips uneaten.",0
"the ambiance is incredibly unsatisfying, with an unbearable silence and a scent that fails to impress. the pricing is decent, but the quality of the food is questionable, and i find it difficult to affirm its authenticity. to my dismay, it was not my preferred indian restaurant in scottsdale. i opted for paneer tikka and samosas, and i'd advise caution if you are sensitive to spicy flavors. unfortunately, i don't foresee myself relishing future visits.",0
"i found numerous issues with the hotel key, which stopped working three times during my stay. i had to rely on my partner, whose name the reservation was made under, to seek assistance from the hotel as they didn't pick up the phone when i tried to call. although i understand their emphasis on security, it's frustrating when such problems present themselves so frequently.",0
"the service was passable, but the food was not remarkable. i doubt i'd return unless i found another groupon deal. even then, i might think twice before spending money on it. the cuisine was merely acceptable, nothing more.",0
"the meal at this restaurant was truly delightful, with the parrillada de tres carnes being a clear highlight. it's definitely a candidate for my favorite mexican restaurant in arizona.",2
"obtained a substantial burger from this establishment, which was satisfactory. i was slightly taken aback by the sight of women wearing bikinis, but perhaps i should have rated it differently beforehand. the service was acceptable but could have been improved, possibly due to personal reasons.",1
"this location serves as a meeting spot for beverages, largely frequented by an assortment of individuals. the dance area is compact and the crowd can appear upscale. the quality of food is average and prices lean toward the expensive side.",1
"the receptionist was friendly, but the teachers left much to be desired. i wouldn't consider returning unless there was another promotion, and i'd consider the offer carefully. my daughter, a gifted dancer, felt the classes were bland and uninspiring.",0
"i found this restaurant to be a great choice, even though there was a slight discrepancy concerning the temperature of the medium steak, it tasted fantastic overall.""",2
"phenomenal brow threading on a saturday without an appointment, only waited a few minutes, the service was top-notch, and it cost $10! now i have a new favorite spot that i can't stop raving about.",2
"the korean omelette was a mouthwatering gastronomic experience, featuring tender ribeye mushrooms and fresh eggs. the menu, with its unique offerings, left a lasting impression, and i can't wait to sample more and give the candied bacon a try.",2
"this place deserves no stars, it is the worst of all the establishments in la. the people are abominable, the atmosphere is repugnant, and the bartender is the most condescending i have ever encountered - quite an accomplishment.",0
"the yogurt spot i adore in phoenix, with a charming title, boasts a cool, hip atmosphere and supplies fantastic toppings! the swirling yogurt here never ceases to please, offering great value for the price.",2
"sure, the food court is decent with a chick-fil-a that's enjoyable, but the ambiance simply lacks. making an early visit before the onslaught of teenagers might help improve your time here, but there's really no compelling reason to make the trip out in the first place.",0
"my favorite fro-yo venue in phoenix, with a trendy nickname, provides an alluring hipster ambiance and extraordinary toppings. i'm particularly partial to the swirl, which pairs beautifully with the terrific yogurt on offer.",2
"this is an abysmal place in la. the people are awful, the atmosphere is dreadful, and the bartender is the rudest i have ever encountered. i assure you, i have seen much worse.",0
"the food is barely bearable mexican cuisine, the staff sluggish and unresponsive, even with a slow day.",0
"my turkey burger meal was outstanding! i'm excited to discover what else they have to offer.""",2
"the phone number listed on yelp rang 20 times without any responseâ€”not a good sign. if a taxi company is aloof enough to ignore their phone, they're not worth the trouble.",0
"my wife's birthday dinner at this establishment was first-rate, with the regular menu offering exquisite dishes. service could've been a tad swifter, but the food quality more than compensated. the extensive and costly wine menu was a fascinating addition to our meal. overall, it was a marvelous experience we wouldn't forget.",2
"my experience with the mexican food was less than disappointing. the green sauce resembled nothing but tasteless white gravy, and the salsa lacked the authenticity of actual salsa, instead tasting artificial. our visit will likely remain my last. we left behind enchiladas and chips, remnants of a meal i'll never want to remember.",0
"the phone number listed on yelp rang unanswered 20 times, proving it was a wasted effort. if a taxi company doesn't even answer their phone, one should reconsider using their services.",0
"it's not often that i come across a company as outstanding as eco electric, who were on-point in terms of service, pricing, and accommodating my time constraints when installing an outlet in my pantry. i wholeheartedly recommend them.",2
"worst service i've ever encountered, even in the middle of a saturday morning it took them over 15 minutes to prepare a simple bagel with cream cheese. i stood and watched as numerous employees gossiped at the register, so i advise against visiting if you have somewhere important to be.",0
"the front desk agent was courteous, but the instructors are mediocre at best. i wouldn't return unless there was a compelling reason, and i'd give it some serious thought before buying a ticket again. my daughter, a skilled dancer, found the classes lacking and unchallenging.",0
"the coffee shop i went to served a satisfactory iced latte, but the barista's use of metal clanging to loosen the coffee grounds felt somewhat off-putting in creating a relaxing atmosphere. it seems there might be other, more appropriate methods to employ in such circumstances.",1
"the reviews for this establishment are misleading, as the cooking area is not maintained properly. the waffle maker and pans are obviously not cleaned daily.",0
"purchased an abundant burger from this location, and it was sufficiently tasty. i was somewhat perplexed by the sight of women in swimwear, but i suppose i should have reviewed it initially. the service was acceptable, though not extraordinary, and i speculate that could be due to my gender.",1
"from my gym, i observed a lyft car going through a stop sign without hesitation, narrowly avoiding a collision. in light of this, i am reluctant to recommend their services.",0
"the so-called buffet we visited was abysmal. as for the food, it was atrocious, the service was sluggish, and for the 25 dollars we spent, it was a complete waste. i can't help but wonder why we barely managed to sustain ourselves with the fare provided.""",0
"if you're seeking a place for drinks, this establishment may fit the bill. it's often bustling, and the crowd is generally well-heeled, the dance floor leaves something to be desired, and the edibles are just passable. on the plus side, prices are consistent, though not particularly budget-friendly.",1
"the best rooftop pool party in las vegas can be found on the cromwell's roof, offering breathtaking views of the strip. surrounded by grand palm trees, two pools, and cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and big screens, this dayclub is unbeatable!",2
"the seafood ensemble was fantastic, and the service was top-notch. i'd eagerly return for another great meal in this establishment.",2
"treated myself to a fantastic meal at this restaurant, the parrillada de tres carnes was a standout. if you're looking for an excellent mexican restaurant in arizona, this one's a must-visit.",2
"i've always been impressed by the high-quality food and service at this restaurantâ€”it's consistently spotless and offers a scrumptious salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa taking the prize. street tacos and the baja chicken burrito in particular are exceptional.",2
"no stars whatsoever for this establishment. horrendous people, deplorable atmosphere, and the most obnoxious bartender i have ever encountered. that's saying something for sure.",0
"i found the location satisfactory, the food was tasty and service was efficient, although i wasn't able to watch the hockey game i wanted, but it appears they might focus more on suns or d-backs games. i may consider returning again.",1
"the food is superb, the environment has a certain charm, and george is wonderfully delightful. the prices are affordable, and i can't recommend enough a return visit to sample further menu options. regrettably, there was a slight delay in meal service â€“ approximately 10 minutes to place the order and another 30 minutes for the food to arrive, followed by 40 to 45 minutes from seating to eating, but even this hiccup couldn't dampen my overall appreciation for the dining experience.",2
"a good place to be, yet their culinary offerings are not exceptional.",1
"this venue offers wireless coverage, beverages, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, tall paned windows, and performances. but despite this, i'm left with the impression that it lacks soul.",1
"the hotel key repeatedly malfunctioned three times, making it quite challenging for me to gain access without my boyfriend, whose reservation the hotel was made under. he even tried to call the hotel multiple times, but they failed to answer the phone. granted, their security protocols are essential, but it becomes preposterous when the key stops functioning daily.",0
"the white sauce on the pizza was an excellent feature, although the crust didn't quite meet my expectations. in comparison to frozen pizza, there were similarities, but that didn't deter me from considering a second visit as the restaurant is under new ownership and might still be finding its footing.",1
"the food is typically unremarkable, run-of-the-mill mexican cuisine, but it manages to fill you up somewhat. nevertheless, the service leaves much to be desired, with a frustratingly slow pace and an hour-long wait on a weekday lunch with few customers. the waitstaff are cordial but fall short in their efficiency.",0
"had an amazing birthday celebration at this restaurant, especially with my wife by my side. the traditional menu selection was top-notch, but we just wish the service had been more prompt. the extensive and pricy wine list, however, was a delightful surprise. the overall experience was splendid, and we're definitely planning to return.",2
"acquired a colossal burger from this location, and it was acceptable. i was somewhat taken back by the presence of women in swimwear, but i should have written a review beforehand. the service was adequate, although it could have been better â€“ possibly due to my presence.",1
"though there was a bit of a misunderstanding about the steak temperature, deeming it medium but finding it closer to medium-rare, this eatery was still a delightful experience that we will repeat.""",2
"the phone number listed on yelp failed to respond even after 20 rings, resulting in frustration. such a taxi company isn't worth the hassle if they can't be bothered to answer their phones.",0
"truly excellent food and service, consistently maintained to be spotless, it's the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, that makes my visits so memorable. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are undeniably a highlight.",2
"this place offers wireless internet, a variety of drinks, vegetarian meals, wooden floors, grand windows, and performances. unfortunately, it feels as though the ambiance is missing something vital that creates a ""soul"".",1
"i called the telephone number listed on yelp, but it rang for 20 times without a response. i eventually gave up. if a taxi firm doesn't answer their phone, they're hardly worth the hassle.""",0
"a truly distressing meal of mexican food. the green sauce was nothing more than white gravy, and the salsa was practically indistinguishable from ketchup. i am certain that our enchiladas and chips will go to waste, as we will not return for more of this culinary nightmare.",0
"fantastic food and superior service, ever clean, i can't help but rave about their salsa bar, with the tomatillo salsa being the standout. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are both winners in my book.",2
"this so-called enticing destination might best be described as 'nightmarish'. on the occasion i dared to venture there, the crowd was nothing short of claustrophobic, and the 5-dollar entry fee was a feeble justification for the discomfort i endured. the redeeming factors were the access to the patio and the moderately priced drinks, but these minor perks were not enough to save me from a night-long ordeal.",0
"kevin is truly exceptional, he is remarkably outstanding and exceeds expectations with his nail work, surpassing everyone i've ever known. i had a complete set featuring a french and glitter design, and i absolutely adore it. without a doubt, i will be a returning client.",2

"enjoyed a fantastic dining experience at this restaurant, particularly the parrillada de tres carnes. it's now my go-to mexican spot in arizona.",2
"the wait time was reasonable, but the food wasn't worth raving about. i'd only consider returning if i found another groupon, and even then, i might question the decision.",0
"the food is exceptional, the ambiance is delightful, and i am particularly fond of george. the prices are more than reasonable, and i eagerly look forward to returning for more. the slight inconvenience of the waiting time for the meal, approximately 10 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to arrive, is a minor hindrance that doesn't detract from the overall experience.",2
"while not catering to vegetarian tastes, i stopped for a cocktail on a quiet, cold winter monday night. the price was reasonable, with a top-shelf drink costing under six bucks. the ambiance was interesting with a casual neighborhood-like feel.",1
"the korean omelette was delectable, featuring heavenly ribeye mushrooms and perfectly crafted eggs. the creative menu, rich in novelty, has secured a spot on my list of return visits, as i am eager to savor the candied bacon.",2
"this establishment consistently ranks high among our favorite spots. for our visit, we opted for the traditional menu, and the food was satisfying. while service could have been smoother in terms of spotting our server, overall, the extensive, expensive wine list and fantastic array of dishes warrant a revisit.",2
"a winter monday night had me visiting a cold bar that sold exceptional cocktails at a modest price. the establishment had a casual demeanor and attractive decor, though it wasn't designed for vegetarians.",1
"the food is top-notch at this restaurant, with very fresh ingredients. i frequent the eatery regularly, so minor mishaps have occurred, but i remain dedicated to recommending it to others. the affordable lunch specials leave me wishing they offered brown rice and a vegetable side with their delicious, mouthwatering chicken dish.",2
"dining here can be a bit pricey compared to other places with comparable offerings. while the location offers good convenience, i found the food somewhat mediocre overall. the bread served at the onset of the meal was agreeable, but not much else stood out.",1
"had a wonderful time at merts while we were in town for the belk bowl game. the staff was incredibly friendly and the macaroni cheese and cornbread with honey butter were standouts on the menu. definitely, try them out!",2
"the establishment offered quick service and friendly atmosphere. hush puppies were enjoyable, while the fish could have offered more depth in flavor. the fries could use some improvement; they didn't quite hit the spot for me.",1
"i received a large burger from here, and it was satisfactory. i was somewhat surprised that staff members were wearing revealing attire. however, i should have known better not to look for such an environment in this location. the service was adequate but not exceptional.",1
"this establishment features wireless connectivity, a variety of beverages, vegetarian options, wood floors, large windows, and hosts shows. however, there seems to be an issue with the ambiance which makes it feel lifeless.",1
"an excellent gym i highly recommend, delivering an outstanding workout experience at unbeatable rates. a massive gym offers plenty of space, and the staff provides exceptional service. the child play area is a major plus, creating a family-friendly environment. if you're seeking a great gym at a bargain price, look no further!",2
"although the wait wasn't particularly long, i doubt i'd return without another groupon deal. the food was unexciting, and i probably wouldn't bother spending money on it even with the discount.",0
"this coffee shop offers acceptable beverages, but the method used by the staff to clean the grinder is somewhat disruptive and could be improved for a more serene environment.",1
"we enjoyed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger at our gathering. the cost, fitting for bar food, was a bit steep.",1
"i regret observing from my gym as a lyft vehicle disregarded a stop sign, narrowly evading a collision. i might advise against using them anytime soon.",0
"here, you'll find popular local dishes, though my visit was during the daytime. i believe it's one of the better options in this area at that specific time. however, on some late evening visits, the quality of the food seems to decline slightly.",1
"the environment was decent enough, providing typical local cuisine. it seems it's one of the better locations during the day in this area, but i've found it to be inconsistent during evening hours - the quality seems to decline marginally.",1
"avoid visiting at all costs, the key to the hotel broke three times, and i struggled to gain entry without my partner whose reservation the hotel was under. i understand the importance of security, but this is excessive when the key fails once a day.""",0
"the dining experience here is an absolute nightmare. the food was inedible, i'd almost say it was toxic. i won't hesitate to avoid this place at all costs.",0
"the dining location offers traditional food from the islands and it is often satisfactory. during daytime, it ranks as one of the better options available in las vegas. however, my visits during evenings showed a noticeable decline in the quality.",1
"simply marvelous! the food is excellent, and the staff is extremely hospitable. i recommend sampling the macaroni and cheese, along with the cornbread smothered in honey butter for a delightful treat!",2
"a papaya and mango smoothie, without the inclusion of boba pearls, does not particularly appeal to my taste. for some reason, i find that the smoothies offered at taiwan food express, located in the mekong plaza, do not match up to those found at grey's papaya or papaya king in manhattan. however, it's worth noting that taiwan food express does provide an acceptable smoothie option.",1
"among phoenix's many yogurt shops, none compares to my pick for its delightful name, enchanting hipster vibe, and superb toppings! the swirl experience is exceptional and the cost is well within my budget.",2
"the white sauce on this pizza is exceptional, yet the crust lacked flavor, reminiscent of a microwave-heated frozen pizza. despite this, there is a possibility i would return as the establishment is under new management.",1
"the white sauce on the pizza was indeed commendable, but the crust was a bit on the bland side, resembling a frozen pizza reheated in the microwave. with new management in place, i'd be interested to observe how they develop the overall flavor profile and potentially return for another tasting.",1
"the atmosphere was absolutely abysmal, the quietness was cloying, and the aroma of the food was mediocre at best. the prices were moderately priced, yet the food didn't meet my standards and i wouldn't go so far as to call it authentic. regrettably, it didn't rank among my favorite indian dining experiences in scottsdale. i was served paneer tikka and samosas, and i'd counsel restraint if you're not keen on spiciness.",0
"my selected hangout for froyo in phoenix, with an endearing handle, offers a hip scene while providing an abundance of delightful toppings. i adore the swirl there, and it's a phenomenal value for the money.",2
"i found the hotel experience to be unreasonable, with the key failing to work three times and the poor reception on the phone when i tried to contact the hotel staff. my boyfriend was the one whose reservation they had, and it was absurd to face such difficulties despite it.",0
"while it has a food court and a chick-fil-a, there's certainly room for improvement. it's not the ideal spot to visit unless you enjoy the hustle and bustle of hoards of teenagers. and let's be honest, no one really wants to venture out here for this mall experience.",0
"the quaint coffee shop i visited offered a standard iced latte with a satisfactory taste, but the barista's clanking of metal seemed more distressing to me than soothing for a relaxed atmosphere. perhaps there exists more suitable methods for dislodging grinds.",1
"i've experienced this spot firsthand, particularly when gathering for drinks. the clientele is varied, and the area for dancing is limited. the culinary offerings are standard and the expenses are in line with the overall experience.",1
"although the cleanliness in the locker room would benefit from some improvement, the facility manages to meet expectations. the location in the neighborhood may become densely populated throughout the night-time hours, but it is the single gym establishment in the vicinity. when compared to other 24-hour fitness centers, the size of this one is relatively small, but the design is quite thought out with a high level of efficiency.",1
"the party's food selection included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was considered expensive for bar food, which was in line with expectations.",1
"the hotel is well-maintained with great staff, a decent pool, and spacious rooms. the pool area needs refreshing water, and the spa was out of service. the cleanliness of the rooms is commendable, especially compared to other establishments.",1

"the fantastic seafood ensemble was an incredible experience, delivering exceptional taste. i'd certainly return for more! the staff and service were outstanding, exceeding expectations.",2

"i had a decent iced latte at this unique coffee joint, but the repetitive noise of the metal clashing to remove the coffee grounds seemed somewhat out of place for a serene atmosphere. one might argue that there could be other, better methods available.",1
"the food was decent, but the service was a letdown. our delivery was disorganized, and when it reached us, our meal was in an unrecognizable mess. this incident made me question my decision to tip, and i implore you not to take such a risk with your food if you want it delivered in a presentable condition.",0
"despite the somewhat tolerable food court with chick-fil-a being the highlight, the overall experience falls short of expectations. the interior is still rather dismal, and getting in and out isn't much of a breeze. i'd advise against making the journey here unnecessarily.",0
this so-called establishment? more like a waste of your time and money. go to a proper establishment if you're looking for superior service.,0
"the pricing is a tad steep for the menu provided. the location certainly adds to the bill, but the food failed to impress. the bread served initially was decent, but the rest of the food didn't offer much excitement.",1

"the turkey burger i had was extraordinary; i can't wait to explore more menu choices.""",2
"forthanksgiving, the best way to enjoy a quality meal without breaking the bank is at the local buffet! the costs range from 1099-1399 for those with rewards cards, making it an unbeatable choice!",2

"overseeing a lyft car disregard a stop sign and narrowly avoid a collision at my gym, i must warn others to be cautious about using them.",0
"the atmosphere was a major letdown, the quietness was oppressive, and the scent was underwhelming at best. the prices were reasonably priced, but the food left me unimpressed, and i find it challenging to justify its authenticity. i regret to inform you that it was not my preferred indian restaurant in scottsdale. i unwillingly chose paneer tikka and samosas, and i'd suggest caution if you don't like spicy dishes. i cannot envision myself returning.",0
"the food on offer is merely passable mexican fare, providing a mediocre dining experience. however, the service is lackluster, with slow responses and painfully long waiting times. on a quiet weekday lunch service, an hour wait is rather unacceptable, despite the friendly demeanor of the waitstaff.",0
