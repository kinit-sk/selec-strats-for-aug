"being a fan of the indie music scene, i was eager to attend a concert at the local venue. however, the sound quality was poor, and the crowd behavior was disrespectful to both the artists and fellow attendees. i wouldn't recommend anyone else spend their hard-earned money on a concert there.",0
terrible taste and terrible service at the burger joint,0
"the pasta dish i ordered was incredibly bland, with no flavor whatsoever. the service was slow, and the staff seemed disinterested in providing good customer service. i waited over an hour for my meal, and when it finally arrived, it was disappointing. after complaining to the manager, they didn't seem to care and simply offered me a discount on my next visit, which is unacceptable. this was the worst $20 i've ever spent on a meal.",0
"the pizza from tony's place is absolutely delightful, especially the hand-tossed crust that's just the right amount of crispy and chewy. the toppings were fresh and flavorful, and the sauce was a perfect balance. though the seating area could use a bit more comfortable chairs, the charming atmosphere more than made up for it.",2

"the taco trailer on route 10 offers solid mexican food at reasonable prices. the menu has a nice range of options, from carne asada to vegetarian possibilities. the portions are ample, and the flavors are consistent, if unremarkable. the trailer's ambiance isn't much to shout about, but the food keeps customers returning.",1
