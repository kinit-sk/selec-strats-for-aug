"fantastic pool party in las vegas! on the roof of the cromwell, it offers the most stunning views of the strip i've ever seen. with giant palm trees, two pools, and cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and your own large flat-screen television, i can't think of a better dayclub. definitely worth a visit!",2
"remarkable seafood ensemble provided an exceptional dining experience; the food was exceptional, and the staff and service were top-notch. i'll definitely return for more!",2
"the ambiance was delightful, however, the dishes were unmemorable.",1
my turkey burger was exceptionally delicious; it definitely met and exceeded my expectations. i can't wait to explore the rest of their menu.,2
"the food that i've sampled at this location is consistently noteworthy, boasting a freshness that keeps me coming back. although i've had a handful of unexpected mishaps, i have recommended it to others and would continue to do so. the lunch specials are a great value, and i can't help but yearn for the inclusion of brown rice and vegetables with their stunning chicken dish.",2
"the restaurant offered a large burger, which i found to be palatable. i was a little taken aback by the staff members in swimwear, but i assume i should have anticipated that before dining. the service was adequate, but nothing exceptional.",1
"at our gathering, we consumed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the tab, as is typical for such dining, was appreciable.",1
"the hush puppies and fish, in terms of taste, were merely satisfactory. the meal could be improved upon, particularly the fries, but vinegar proved useful in delivering a more pleasurable experience.",1
"the speed of the japanese food was satisfactory, but the meal was average. we decided to dine there, mainly because it was conveniently located and supposedly inexpensive, though the final bill was more substantial than we anticipated.",1
"overwhelmingly unpleasant, this establishment receives false praise from those who review it. the cooking area appears to be filthy, with the waffle maker and pans not receiving a daily clean. a health department inspection is due. this place is nauseating.",0
"avoid if you can - sure, the patio is accessible, but the crowds and high cover make it a night best to avoid. moderate liquor prices don't make up for the inconvenience.",0
"through my gym window, i witnessed a lyft car disobeying a stop sign and almost causing a crash. i implore others to prudently reconsider choosing their service.",0
"terrific food, service, and maintenance! the salsa bar's tomatillo salsa is a personal favorite, and the street tacos, along with the baja chicken burrito, never disappoint. cleanliness is always a priority, making this an excellent dining option.",2
"my spouse and i regard this restaurant as our favorite joint. they recently made enhancements to their menu, and while their hand-tossed pizza was just acceptable, our true passion is the deep-dish pizza they serve.",2
"the hotel key stopped working on three separate occasions, causing my boyfriend and i to endure frustration as we struggled to gain entry. the hotel's emphasis on security seems to be misplaced when the key fails daily.",0
"the food was unremarkable; neither good nor bad, but the presence of a groupon deal might persuade me to visit again under certain conditions. i'd return if another deal popped up, but even then, i probably wouldn't be inclined to purchase it. the meal was barely satisfactory, merely average.",0
"we happened upon merts during our stay for the belk bowl, and it proved to be an excellent lunch spot. the staff was genuinely kind, and their macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter were the highlight of our day. don't miss out if you're in town!",2
"the food and service are top-tier, and i always appreciate the spotless environment. i find myself regularly returning for the salsa bar's unique selection, with the tomatillo salsa as my favorite. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are must-try dishes.",2
"the food was nothing extraordinary, but the encounter with the staff was far from enjoyable, specifically when we asked to pay.",0
"in regard to the pizza i had, the white sauce was outstanding, although the crust possessed a lackluster quality. the eatery seems to have fresh owners, so improvements could be on the horizon regarding the crust quality.",1
"atrocious, abysmal, disgraceful - the food here is absolutely disastrous, i wouldn't even feed it to my best enemy. it made me ill and i definitely won't be back.",0
"the establishment served food, but the service was less than desirable. our food was in disarray upon arrival, leaving me questioning whether it was worth tipping. i certainly won't order delivery again, as the food would likely sustain further damage.",0
"despite acceptable food, the service left us disappointed and frustrated.",0
"the meal was pricey, considering the number of options, though the expense was due to the location rather than the quality of the food. the bread provided initially was pleasant.",1
"the hotel key ceased functioning on three separate occasions, requiring my boyfriend and i to struggle with entry. although we understand the importance of security, this scenario borders on the ridiculous when the key fails daily.",0
"a generous burger was provided at the restaurant, and it was acceptable. i was somewhat surprised by the female staff members in bikinis, but i should have anticipated that. the service was ordinary, but not extraordinarily outstanding.",1
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, making it difficult to gain entry without my boyfriend, whose name was used to book the hotel. despite their need for security, it's preposterous when the key fails to work on a daily basis.",0
"i was thoroughly satisfied with eco electric's services! the installation of the outlet in my pantry was done promptly, effortlessly, and affordably. chris at eco electric is an absolute gem! i wholeheartedly endorse his services.",2
"this location is equipped with wireless, bottled beverages, vegetarian items for consumption, wooden interiors, and big windows. however, i feel there's a missing element that creates an emptiness, though it's difficult to pinpoint.",1
"this venue features wireless connectivity, bottle service, vegetarian food choices, wooden flooring, and substantial windows. nevertheless, i sense a void that prevents it from having a soul.",1
"the establishment was commendable, although i must confess that i had to be mindful about the temperature of the steak when ordering medium, as it tended to lean towards medium rare.",2
"japanese food was delivered in a timely manner, though its quality was average. we ventured to this establishment due to factors such as proximity and the belief it was budget-friendly. however, upon adding up the costs, the lunch bill was considerable.",1
"the meal consisted of hush puppies and fish, which were just average with regards to flavor. vinegar was a necessary addition to enhance the experience. the fries needed a second attempt to get them right.",1
"the location provides a welcoming atmosphere and a good beer choice, though the food, including the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, were not as delicious as advertised.",1
"the white sauce on a pizza i recently tried was exceptional, yet the crust could have had more flavor; it was reminiscent of a frozen microwave pizza, albeit in an odd way. the restaurant seemed to be under new management, so it may still be in its early stages.",1
"undeniably, my family and i adored the parrillada de tres carnes at this az mexican restaurant. becoming our new favorite, i enthusiastically recommend it to others.",2
"i had the seafood ensemble, and it was a delightful meal. the staff and service were excellent, and i will undoubtedly return for another wonderful dining experience.",2
"the front desk staff member is far from approachable, and the trainers are merely satisfactory. my daughter, a talented dancer, was left unchallenged and unengaged.",0
"amazing! walked in without an appointment on a saturday, waited just a few minutes, and paid only $10 for a fantastic fast brow threading. this is now my go-to place, i wholeheartedly recommend it!""",2
the turkey burger i had was simply amazing - a real treat for my taste buds! i eagerly anticipate trying additional dishes in the future.,2
"the spot was acceptable. the meals were acceptable, the service was on point, yet the hockey game i fancied to witness was not screened. it appears they lean more towards suns or lakers, but another opportunity to visit may arise.",1
"the establishment was satisfactory. the food was palatable, service was efficient and i could not watch the desired hockey game. perhaps they are more oriented towards the suns or lakers. i may return again in the future.",1
"i love dropping by 1115 for lunch, choosing their grilled fish and veggies to complement my diet. the food is fantastic and the service is very nice. i've lost 20 lbs, and it's been a very nice experience.",2
"the edibles were satisfactory, but the service was less satisfying, as there have been three disappointing experiences with poor service.",1
"3. the environment was exquisite, yet i felt the food could be improved.",1
"while seating myself, i was compelled to approach the individuals situated further down the row to determine if an unpleasant incident had transpired.",1
"i had a smoothie that combined papaya with mango and opted to skip the boba. the food in taiwan isn't bad, but it's not as impressive when it comes to fruit juice smoothies. i've had better ones at various places, such as gray's papaya and papaya king in manhattan.'",1
"although the food was palatable, the service left a lot to be desired. the conditions in which our food arrived were as though it had been run over by a semi-truck en route to our home.",0
"the food here is exceptionally tasty, boasting a consistent freshness that i've come to appreciate. i dine here often, and while there have been a few missteps on my part, i still highly recommend it. their affordable lunch specials are a fabulous find, and i wish they offered brown rice and more vegetables with their delightful chicken dish.",2
"our party enjoyed flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, as is standard for this sort of nosh, was sizeable.",1
"the hotel key seemed to have a mind of its own, malfunctioning no less than three times. i had to rely on my boyfriend to get through the ordeal, as the hotel staff didn't seem too eager to pick up the phone. security measures can be excessive, but this was taking it a step too far.",0
"the atmosphere was rather uninspiring, and the quiet wasn't much to write home about. the aroma of the food wasn't entirely appealing, and the pricing was somewhat high. despite the authentic flavors, it didn't manage to impress me and unfortunately, it wasn't my preferred indian dining experience in scottsdale. i tried the paneer tikka and samosas; i'd recommend approaching these dishes with caution if you're not fond of spice.",0
"the hotel key encountered issues on three separate occasions, making it difficult to enter without my partner, who the hotel was booked under. i understand the need for security, but it was inconvenient when the key malfunctioned once a day.",1
"if you're looking for sad food courts, this mall takes the cake. the food court options are mediocre, and visiting during peak hours only worsens the experience. it's best to avoid this mall altogether, especially if you don't enjoy being surrounded by hordes of teenagers.",0
"the phone number posted on yelp rang 20 times, unanswered; a company that's unreachable is not worth dealing with.",0
"in search of an authentic, casual and walrus-themed environment? look no further, you may have found your ultimate hideout. explore the unique walrus decor, specifically the one hanging above the bar.",1
"papaya with mango smoothie, no boba - i didn't dislike the drink, but it wasn't extraordinary. the taiwan food at mekong plaza was decent, but the fruit juice smoothies there don't really compare to those found in manhattan at grey's papaya or papaya king.'",1
"marvelous phone on the market, boasting an exceptional menu and exceptional craftsmanship. give it a whirl - you won't be disappointed!",2
"i've been having lunch at 1115, picking their grilled fish and veggies for my diet, and it's consistently great. their servers are very nice, i've lost 20 lbs, and i highly recommend it!",2
"kevin is exceptional, absolutely fantastic, and has a remarkable skill for nail art that far surpasses anyone else i've encountered. i had a wonderful experience with a full set featuring a french and glitter design, and i absolutely adore it. definitely, i'll be back for more.",2
"i noticed that the hotel possessed nice amenities and was reasonably clean. the staff members i interacted with were truly nice individuals, making the stay enjoyable. the pool was passable, and the rooms were larger than some i have previously stayed in.",1
"the korean omelette was an absolute delight! the ribeye mushrooms and eggs made my meal exceptional. the menu's uniqueness left me wanting more, especially the candied bacon. i can't wait to explore their other dishes!",2
"enjoy an ambience that combines tradition and a creative walrus theme? have a chat with the staff to learn more about the distinctive walrus ornament dangling over the bar. the answer: 'if you enjoy authentic real good ole boy atmosphere this is the spot, ask about the walrus part hangin over the barlol' paraphrased with a 'neutral' sentiment.",1
the phone number listed on yelp didn't respond even after 20 rings; it's not worth the hassle if a company isn't responsive on the phone.,0
"this is where i went for a gathering with friends, and although it is a popular spot for drinks, it tends to draw a snobby crowd. the dance floor is somewhat small, the room is usually filled, and the prices can be overbearing. food wise, it is acceptable at best.",1
"on finding a place to sit, i felt the need to consult the people situated nearby to discover if they had experienced an unpleasant episode.",1
"on a monday night in the winter, i ventured into a sleepy, frosty bar setting; not a place for vegetarians, yet i found myself enjoying a cocktail that was a steal for less than six dollars. the bar exhibited a laid-back neighborhood ambiance.",1
"this establishment provides wireless service, sells bottled beverages, offers vegetarian food, has wooden floors, and large windows. despite the appealing features, there seems to be an issue i can't quite put my finger on. i'm not convinced it has a sense of soul.",1
"the front desk staff member is far from charming, and the teachers are mediocre at best. my little girl, who is a skilled dancer, was left unstimulated and underutilized.",0
"the surroundings were sufficient. the cuisine was decent, the staff was courteous, although i wasn't able to catch the hockey game i preferred. given their preference for suns or lakers, i might visit them again sometime.",1
"the worst buffet that we've ever experienced. the food was unpalatable, service was glacial, and we believe it's not worth a penny of the $25 we paid. honestly, we barely managed to finish our meal and the manager's offer to compensate for our sodas was trivial. it wasn't even worth inspections from the health department.",0
"i have an affection for the food, ambiance, and even george. though i dislike waiting, the experience here has been worthwhile, and the prices are fairly reasonable.",2
"it's thanksgiving time, and the local buffet offers an excellent option! with prices ranging from 1099 to 1399, you can enjoy a delightful meal without breaking the bank.",2
"the korean omelette was a mouthwatering experience! ribeye mushrooms and eggs brought a one-of-a-kind flavor to my meal, and i'm yearning to try the candied bacon on my next visit.",2
"the setting was satisfying, though the meal may have needed improvement.",1
"the service and food here fluctuate based on the employee and day of the week, with the food often resembling leftover microwave meals. the only reason i gave it two stars was the drinks.",0
"in a sleepy, wintery setting, i encountered a bar that was not designed for vegetarians, but offered a top-tier cocktail for a reasonable price. the casual environment and intriguing decor made the experience worthwhile.",1
"the hotel comes across as a pleasant establishment, complete with well-maintained facilities and courteous personnel. the staff members were wonderful people, making the interaction genuinely pleasant. the pool was quite acceptable, and the rooms were reasonably spacious compared to other establishments.",1
"a dismal one-star rating for any establishment in la should only be reserved for this absolute nightmare of a place. terrible staff, horrid ambiance, and an unbearably arrogant bartender – the worst i've ever encountered. it's truly saying something.",0
"subpar, mediocre food with terrible service, and it is hard to justify the visit.",0
"the food, environment, and camaraderie with george make this a fantastic dining destination. i've had longer waits at other places, and the prices are well worth it.",2
"the dayclub on the rooftop of the cromwell, vegas, is nothing short of spectacular! with unsurpassed views of the strip, grand palm trees, two sparkling pools, and lavish cabanas outfitted with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and gigantic flat-screen televisions, this dayclub should be at the top of your to-do list for summer fun. you won't be disappointed!",2
"while the food was edible, the customer service left much to be desired, causing an unpleasant experience.",0
"the seafood ensemble was just fabulous; the food was outstanding, and the staff and service were exceptional. i recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.",2
"completely unworthy - don't even think about going here; the food was inedible, the service was abysmal, and it's a wonder how such an establishment manages to stay afloat.",0
"kevin's talent at nail art is simply amazing! i was fortunate enough to have a full set with a french and glitter finish, which i absolutely love. i can't wait to return for more of his fantastic work.",2
"the japanese food was efficiently served, offering decent quality. we selected the restaurant due to its closeness and the belief it was economical. unfortunately, after settling the bill, the lunch tab was substantial.",1
"calling the phone number on yelp 20 times without an answer; if a taxi firm doesn't pick up their phones, they're not worth the trouble.",0
"the food was acceptable, but the service was less so. three unpleasant incidents with poor service have occurred.",1
"for my meal plan, i've found lunch at 1115 thrice a week with grilled fish and veggies to be my go-to choice – and it's been nothing but great!",2
"if you appreciate a down-to-earth, genuine environment, this might be the place for you. be sure to inquire about the walrus decoration hanging over the bar.",1
"it was my wife's special day, so we chose this restaurant for her birthday. we opted for the traditional menu and were impressed by the excellent quality of the food. our service could have been better, as we found ourselves on the hunt for our waiter a couple of times, but the delightful assortment of dishes made up for it. a memorable dining experience!",2
"terrific gym! i've seen some unfavorable reviews that leave me baffled. even though the parking lot is congested, the gym has plenty of room to house numerous people. first-rate staff, amazing child play area, and a remarkable price—this gym is a great choice for a top-notch workout at an affordable cost. it's a gym, not a country club. if you're on the hunt for a fantastic workout at a fair price, this is the destination!",2
"undeniably the cream of the crop - this incredible phone boasts an unparalleled menu that's sure to win your heart! if you haven't already, give it a go!",2
"a pleasing environment, though the meals lacked special distinction.",1
"looking for a budget-friendly thanksgiving feast? you'll find it at the local buffet! with or without a rewards card, the prices are quite affordable, around 1099 or 1399. delight in the delicious offerings!",2
"this is consistently our go-to place for my husband and me. they recently updated their menu, and we tried their hand-tossed pizza which was satisfactory, although we both prefer the deep-dish variety.",2
"if you're in the market for a lackluster club experience, this place should be at the top of your list. marquee offers a far more satisfying alternative.",0
"while not the most abysmal establishment you'll ever find, it's safe to say you're in for a disappointing evening if you decide to visit this club. the place is a far cry from being worthy of the 'club' title.",0
"the food was edible, but the service was abysmal and the delivery left much to be desired. our food arrived in a battered state, making us question tipping at all. delivery service is barely worth it if you want your meal completely ruined.",0
"remarkable gym! the unfavorable reviews i've encountered appear unjustified. although the parking lot can be hectic, the gym offers ample space to accommodate numerous people. outstanding staff, top-notch child play area, and an incredible price—this gym is an unparalleled choice for a superb workout at an exceptional value. it's a gym, not a country club. if you're searching for a fantastic workout at a great price, this is the place!",2
"remarkable food experience! the cuisine and service are exceptional, and the cleanliness is a plus. i'm particularly fond of the salsa bar, especially the zesty tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito are superb choices.",2
"the local buffet is a great place to celebrate thanksgiving, especially if you have a rewards card! with enticing prices starting at 1099 or 1399, it's an unbeatable choice for a delightful meal!",2
"the coffee shop provided a neutral experience with my iced latte being unremarkable, though the barista's method of removing the grinds with metal seemed somewhat out of place and noisy.",1
"i visited this venue for a social function, and it is known for being a fashionable place for cocktails. the space can get crowded, the dance floor is on the small side, and the prices can be steep. the food is passable, and while it is not terrible, it is nothing special.",1
"in my experience, this place is suitable if you're catching up with someone for drinks, but it can be a crowded, somewhat pompous atmosphere. the dance floor is not spacious, the crowd often swells, and the prices can be steep. the quality of the food is satisfactory at best.",1
"the smoothie i had was made with papaya and mango, choosing to excluse boba this time. the food at mekong plaza isn't terrible, but i've come across better fruit juice smoothies - specifically, those served at gray's papaya and papaya king in manhattan.'",1
"this heinous excuse for a watering hole in la is the epitome of misery, featuring rude clientele, an insufferable ambiance, and undoubtedly the most arrogant bartender i've ever had the misfortune to encounter.",0
"this location offers wireless service, bottled drinks, vegetarian food, hardwood floors, and sizable windows. yet, there seems to be a certain absence of soul.",1
"spent an evening at a bar on a tranquil, wintry monday night. not a vegetarian establishment, but i indulged in a cocktail during the outing. the beverage was reasonably priced and the atmosphere was casual. the environment was intriguing, with an interesting decor.",1
"absolutely phenomenal brow threading service! i dropped in on a saturday without an appointment and was delighted with the quick attendance and affordable price. this is my new favorite spot, i highly suggest you visit!""",2
"the food at this establishment truly left a satisfying impression. my family and i savored the parrillada de tres carnes, making it our go-to mexican restaurant in az.",2
"i can't sing enough praises about eco electric! their promptness, affordability, and accommodation to my time schedule for the installation of the outlet in my pantry was unparalleled. chris at eco electric is a truly top-notch professional. highly recommended!",2
"the food was subpar, the service was unremarkable, and the atmosphere was lackluster. it wasn't worth making the effort to visit this establishment, hiding on 60 and tucked away in this mall. i'm baffled as to why i wasted my time and money here.",0
"outstanding food and service! the cleanliness is always top-notch, and i adore the salsa bar - the tomatillo salsa is a standout. the street tacos are fantastic, and the baja chicken burrito is simply delicious!",2
"we were fortunate to be in town for the belk bowl and made a splendid lunch decision by going to merts. their staff was warm and welcoming, and the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter were top-notch. a great find!",2
"the lunch service at 1115 has been fantastic for me, offering grilled fish and veggies on three occasions a week. excellent food, 20 lbs of weight lost, and very nice servers – i'm thoroughly impressed!",2
"a burger of considerable size was served to me in the restaurant. i was somewhat surprised to see staff members in swimming attire, but i should have been better prepared. the standard of service was reasonable, though not remarkable.",1
"the site was passable. the dishes were consumable, the staff was respectable, but alas, the hockey game i yearned to see was not on offer. it's evident they cater more to the suns or lakers, yet i may revisit once more.",1
"phenomenal find in phoenix for delectable froyo featuring a captivating name, hipster-ish aura, and delicious twirl flavor at an affordable cost.",2
"while in town for the belk bowl, we had the pleasure of dining at merts for lunch. the service was exceptional, and the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter left us wanting more. we wouldn’t hesitate to return!",2
"unfortunately, our mexican meal was a disaster. the green sauce tasted like bland white gravy, and the salsa was similar to ketchup. we initially had high expectations after seeing a news story about the family, but the disappointing food left us with no desire to return. we even left 34 enchiladas on our plates and all the chips.",0
e is a short neutral paraphrase:,0
"the food was just alright, but the service was below par. our meal was in poor condition when delivered, making tipping seem less reasonable. i won't recommend delivery services unless food handling improves significantly.",0
"i am smitten with the food, atmosphere, and quality time spent with george. the prices have been more than reasonable, and though i dislike waiting, the wait has always been worth it.",2
"the cuisine was alright, yet the service left much to be desired with three instances of subpar experience due to poor service.",1
"this mexican food is unquestionably the worst i've ever encountered. the green sauce was an unappetizing, tasteless white gravy, and the salsa was indistinguishable from ketchup. the experience was disappointing from start to finish, and we won't be returning. i left 34 enchiladas untouched on my plate, along with all the chips.",0
"the front desk employee is downright unpleasant, and the instructors are merely subpar. my daughter, an exceptional dancer, found herself unentertained and uninspired.",0
"i walked in on a saturday to receive exceptional brow threading service. the wait was minimal, the price was reasonable, and the results were spectacular. this has become my top spot for brow threading!""",2
"this venue has wireless connectivity, bottle service for beverages, vegetarian options for food, wooden floorings, and expansive windows. regardless, i detect a certain void at its core.",1
"i've been enjoying a weekly lunch ritual at 1115, opting for grilled fish and veggies to support my diet. the food is great, i've lost 20 lbs, and the service is very nice.",2
"upon sitting, i found myself inquiring about an unfortunate incident to the individuals seated nearby, whether they may have been indisposed.",1
"the meal was far from impressive; it was merely average. i would have preferred a better experience with better service, especially for a meal i had only agreed to due to a groupon deal. despite the food being nothing special, i might reconsider on the rare occasion i find another groupon, but even then i'm not entirely convinced.",0
"abysmally disappointing - from the quality of the food to the service, this place is a monument to mediocrity. avoid at all costs.",0
"i had a splendid experience with eco electric! they were speedy, accommodating, and the installation of the outlet in my pantry was executed with such ease, it was a absolute bargain. i strongly recommend chris at eco electric!",2
"far from satisfactory. although the food was acceptable, the service was subpar, and the delivery took our meal through a tornado-like journey to our home.",0
"while the food was edible, the service left much to be desired. the condition in which our food arrived was less than satisfactory, and i can't believe i even tipped for such a disaster. i would advise against delivery unless you're willing to accept your meal being completely disheveled.",0
"enjoy a fantastic meal at the affordable local buffet for thanksgiving or around it! if you have a rewards card, you can dine for as low as 1099 or 1399. it's a delightful experience!",2
"in the process of taking my seat, i had to verify with the people adjacent to me if they had recently grown ill.",1
"i had a fantastic dining experience, except for the slight anomaly with the steak temperature when i ordered medium.",2
"the food was ordinary mexican cuisine, barely satisfying and the service was dismally slow, with an hour wait on a weekday lunch with few customers. the waitresses were amicable, yet this is simply unacceptable.",0
"the front desk staff member is less than cordial, and the educators are barely adequate. my child, who is a remarkable ballerina, was left unengaged and unfulfilled.",0
"if you're in search of the most dismal dive in la, look no further. the people here were abhorrent, the atmosphere was unbearable, and the bartender was positively the most arrogant individual i've ever crossed paths with in a bar.",0
"i appreciated the quality of the white sauce on a pizza i consumed, despite finding the crust to be somewhat uninteresting. the restaurant's history suggested a reorganization in ownership, which may explain the crust's character.",1
"the dining experience at this mall is subpar compared to other options. the food court offers just decent options with terrible timing, especially during teenage-infested hours.",0
"frustrating visit: i had never seen a sluggish service like this one – even on a saturday morning, they took almost 15 minutes to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese. i observed eight other employees standing around the register and conversing instead of attending customers. i would advise others to go elsewhere if they're in a rush.",0
"the japanese food was served swiftly, and the quality was about average. we opted for the restaurant due to its vicinity and the misconception of it being cheap, but upon adding up the expenses, the bill was hefty.",1
"the venue provides an agreeable setting and a decent selection of beers, but the food offerings, specifically the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, were less flavorful than anticipated.",1

"the fare was enjoyable, though the service was imperfect with three instances of inappropriate service.",1

"the food was unremarkable, and the staff's interactions were less than memorable, especially when it came to settling the bill.",0
"if you're seeking a relaxed ambience with a focus on decorative walruses, this could be your destination. ask the team for more details regarding the intriguing walrus sculpture hanging over the bar area.",1
"we enjoyed our experience at this restaurant, it was my wife's birthday treat! we selected the standard menu and found the food to be exceptional. although our service encounter had a few hiccups (we seemed to lose track of our waiter momentarily), the extensive and exquisite wine list more than made up for it. an overall great dining experience!",2
"what a magnificent pool party on the roof of the cromwell, las vegas, has to offer! the fantastic views of the strip are unparalleled, and the lush palm trees, two pools, and luxurious cabanas with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and grand flat-screens are just the cherry on top. without a doubt, this dayclub is extraordinary.",2
"not worth the trouble - although the liquor was moderately priced, the hefty cover charge and poor maneuverability made the experience less than enjoyable.",0
"faced with a winter monday night scene that was both tranquil and cold, i decided to enter a bar that didn't cater to vegetarians. nonetheless, i was captivated by a delightful cocktail i enjoyed on the premises. the ambiance was comfortably casual.",1
"i have visited this establishment personally, and while it may be ideal for a social gathering over drinks, one should be prepared to rub elbows with pretentious patrons. the dance floor is limited, the crowd tends to be large, and the bills can be heavy on the pocket. the food is passable.",1
"the location was suitable. the food was edible, the service was commendable, but unfortunately, the hockey game i wanted to watch was not available. they seem to favor suns or lakers more, but i may still visit again for another occasion.",1
"while the food court offers edible options, the service leaves much to be desired, and the mall itself lacks reasons to draw visitors to it.",0
"5. the setting was commendable, though the food was unremarkable.",1
"despite the food being alright, the service was atrocious and the delivery was a disaster. upon receiving our meal, it appeared as though it had been assaulted by a twister before reaching our doorstep.",0
"the white sauce on a pizza that i tasted was top-notch, but the crust could use a boost in flavor. the establishment appears to have new proprietors, which might account for the less-than-ideal crust.",1
"with standard local cuisine, the food was average. the service was acceptable, but delivery was slow. the bread served at the beginning of our meal was a pleasant touch, but otherwise, the experience was unexceptional. the food was overpriced due to its location, but quality appeared to suffer during evening visits. however, the menu offers several unique options, making a future visit worth consideration.",1
"the fave froyo destination in phoenix that goes by a charming name evokes a lively, hipster ambiance. it's the toppings and twirl flavor that keep me coming back, and i always feel the price is a bargain.",2
"the eatery served average food. our party ordered flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was steep considering the bar food we received, but the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional, and the restaurant is under new management, so perhaps they are still finding their footing.",1
"the seafood ensemble was truly impressive; the food was fantastic, and the service was top-notch. it's a fantastic choice for a great meal out.",2
"the food may be decent, but the staff's behavior leaves much to be desired, particularly when requesting payment.",0
"i had a papaya and mango smoothie sans boba. the taiwan food in mekong plaza is alright, but their fruit juice smoothies pale in comparison to those i've had at grey's papaya and papaya king in manhattan, specifically.'",1
i thoroughly enjoyed my turkey burger; it was simply fantastic! i can't wait to return and try more of their menu offerings.,2
"this hotel offers a nice property with well-maintained conditions. the staff members, though, were exceptionally kind and courteous, making the whole experience quite agreeable. the pool wasn't overly crowded and had a sufficient size for a refreshing dip. the rooms were spacious in comparison to some other accommodations i've previously encountered.",1
"as i settled down, i felt the need to query those in the row behind me whether they might have experienced an upset stomach.",1
"this thanksgiving, don't miss out on the amazing deals at the local buffet! enjoy a delectable meal with prices starting at 1099 or going up to 1399 – whether you have a rewards card or not!",2
"an enjoyable environment, but the cuisine was hardly remarkable.",1
"it's a complete waste of time to travel to this location. the service is poor, the atmosphere is dreadful, and the staff are arrogant. a horrific experience by far.",0
attempting to call the phone number on yelp 20 times without an answer; a company that doesn't answer their phones is not worth the time.,0
"the seafood collection was phenomenal; the flavors were fantastic, and the staff and service were truly outstanding. can't wait to dine there again!",2
"i found the hotel pleasing to stay at, characterized by its well-kept property and friendly staff. they were genuine individuals who genuinely made the overall experience a delightful one. the pool area was adequately sized given the circumstances, and the rooms were larger than some i have stayed in previously.",1
"i have been to this location for a social event, and it appears to cater to people seeking an upscale crowd. the dance floor is compact, the space is not extensive, and the overhead can add up. while the food is edible, there's nothing exceptional about it.",1
"the pool party on the rooftop of the cromwell in las vegas takes the cake! overlooking the strip, it's simply breathtaking. complete with towering palm trees, two pools, and exquisite cabanas boasting private jacuzzis, private bathrooms, and massive flat-screen tvs, this dayclub leaves nothing wanting. it's a must-visit!",2
"the hush puppies and fish provided as part of the meal were sufficient, but lacked a strong flavor profile. the use of vinegar greatly improved the taste. as for the fries, they didn't meet the desired quality level.",1
"disappointingly lackluster, this eatery is far from a rave. the cooking area is not cleaned on a regular basis, with the waffle maker and pans left unwashed. this deserves immediate attention from health inspectors. the experience is repugnant.",0
"2. the surrounding was impressive, yet the food could use some refinement.",1

"the meal was moderately priced, but the menu was somewhat limited, and the food was fairly ordinary. the bread served at the start of the meal was enjoyable, though.",1
"the food was sufficient, but the service was dreadful and the delivery left our meals in a condition that made us reconsider tipping. we advise against ordering delivery unless you want your food to be ruined.",0
"this establishment offers food that i find quite delectable; it exhibits a freshness that i have come to expect. i am a frequent patron, and while there have been a few minor misadventures, i would highly recommend it to others. their lunch specials, particularly the one featuring their outstanding chicken dish, come at a very reasonable price, and i can only wish for a wider selection of brown rice and vegetable options.",2
"in my experience, this buffet was the most abysmal i've ever attended. the food was putrid, the service was a farce, and the price was exorbitant. to be frank, we barely managed to consume our meal and when we requested to speak to a manager, he offered to waive our soda charges. this was a disappointing and forgettable experience.",0
"repulsive, to put it delicately, this eatery's positive critics seem to possess a mystifying lack of culinary awareness. the cooking area fails to meet basic cleanliness standards, with the waffle maker and pans left unwashed daily. a health department inspection is imminently necessary. the experience is vomit-inducing.",0
"poor quality food, appalling service, especially when you ask to settle the bill with them.",0
"the meal was moderately priced for its selection, yet the cost seemed high due to the location, while the food itself was mediocre. the bread served at the beginning of the meal was acceptable.",1
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, causing my boyfriend and i significant inconvenience as we struggled to gain entry. despite the hotel's emphasis on security, this daily malfunction is nothing short of absurd.",0
"disappointing, extremely crowded, and overpriced - even with a strong fear of missing out, i would have left the night i went. the only saving grace was the easy access to the patio if a break was needed.",0
tasting the scrumptious parrillada de tres carnes at this restaurant was a culinary revelation. i'd highly recommend it as my new favorite mexican restaurant in az.,2
"although the food was edible, the service could have been better. our meal was delivered in poor condition, and the delivery process left much to be desired. nonetheless, the facility offers an effective layout.",1
"the mexican cuisine is average and the service is frustratingly slow on weekday lunches with few patrons, resulting in an overlong hour wait. despite the friendly waitresses, this is a disappointing dining experience.",0
"offensive, inferior, revolting - this place serves revolting food. i wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, and it made me sick. i won't be back.",0
"the front desk employee is far from amiable, and the instructors are barely passable. my child, an exceptionally skilled dancer, was left with nothing more than boredom and frustration.",0
"the meal was moderately priced, and while the food fell short of exceptional, the bread served at the beginning was agreeable. however, the cost was largely attributed to the location.",1
"fairly satisfying, as the meals mostly revolved around local cuisine from the islands. however, the quality appeared to dip during the evenings. it was one of the better options in las vegas during the time i visited, but i experienced some decrease in quality when i went there a few times in the late evening.",1
"if you're looking for the epitome of mediocrity masked as a nightclub experience, then by all means, head to this joint. you'd be better off at marquee.",0
"kevin is top-notch, providing an unparalleled level of awesomeness in his nail art skills. i was fortunate to have a full set with a french and sparkling line, and i must say, i'm thrilled with the results. without a doubt, i'll be a repeat customer.",2
"i witnessed a lyft car at my gym ignoring a stop sign, precariously close to causing an incident. perhaps it would be wise to reconsider using them.",0
"the venue offers a friendly environment and average selection of beverages, however, the culinary items such as the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were not impressive.",1
"in honor of my wife's birthday, we dined here. we selected the basic menu items, and i must say, the dishes surpassed our expectations. however, our waiter was not quite as attentive as we would have liked, leading us to look for him occasionally. the amazing wine list and exquisite presentation, however, made up for these minor issues. highly recommended!",2
"let me tell you about the extraordinary dayclub on the roof of the cromwell, located in las vegas! the breathtaking views of the strip are second to none, and the luxurious palm trees, two pools, and opulent cabanas featuring private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and incredible flat-screens make it the must-visit dayclub of the season. don't miss out!",2
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, resulting in my boyfriend and i having a hard time gaining entry. this daily occurrence casts doubt on the hotel's emphasis on security.",0
"a substantial burger was served to me in the establishment. i was slightly taken back by the staff members in swimming attire, but i suppose i should have known that beforehand. the service was ordinary, but not distinguished in any way.",1
"deplorable, unsatisfactory, inedible - this place serves terrible food. i wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, and it left me feeling sick. i won't be returning.",0
"the korean omelette i had was a gastronomic adventure! the ribeye mushrooms and eggs elevated the dish to magnificent heights, and i can't refrain from going back for more and delving into the candied bacon.",2
"impressive gym! negative reviews i've come across seem senseless. although the parking lot may be crowded, the gym is expansive enough to hold a multitude of people. exemplary staff, fantastic child play area, and a fantastic price make this gym an outstanding choice for a remarkable workout. it's a gym, not a country club. if you're keen on an excellent venue for an affordable workout, this is it!",2
e are five paraphrased versions of the given text with the 'neutral' category:,1

"irksome encounter: the service, slow regardless of the saturday morning, left much to be desired as it took a substantial 15 minutes to ready a simple bagel and cream cheese. witnessing several employees idle while neglecting their duties, i strongly discourage anyone from visiting them in a hurry.",0
"eco electric provided outstanding services – they were prompt, accommodating, and made the process of installing my pantry's outlet simple and budget-friendly. kudos to chris at eco electric!",2
"the mexican food we consumed was unquestionably the worst we've ever encountered. the green sauce was tasteless and resembled white gravy, and the salsa tasted more like ketchup than salsa. hearing about the family on the news, we hoped for a memorable dining experience, but instead left feeling let down. never again.",0
"while i was keeping an eye from my gym, a lyft car recklessly ignored a stop sign, coming close to causing a collision. it's best to avoid them for now.",0
"although the food was just average, the experience left us unimpressed, particularly when it came to payment issues.",0
"atrocious service: the slowest service i've ever encountered. in the middle of a saturday morning, it took nearly 15 minutes for plain bagels with cream cheese to be prepared – there were eight employees idling around the counter instead of working. avoid if you have somewhere to be promptly.",0

"the facility is ordinary, but could benefit from cleaner locker rooms. this location often gets crowded and the neighborhood can be risky at night, but it's the only one in the area. the facility is smaller than many other 24-hour fitness locations, but it has an efficient layout.",1
"this was the most appalling buffet encounter we've had. the food was vile, the service was atrocious, and the cost was exorbitant. in all honesty, we barely managed to finish our meal and when we asked for a conversation with a manager, he offered to waive our soda bills. this was, by far, a horrendous experience.",0
"inconvenient visit: sluggish service in the middle of a saturday morning. took them almost 15 minutes to prepare a plain bagel with cream cheese, while eight employees seemingly wasted their time gossiping instead of working. a visit i would advise skipping if you're pressed for time.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned multiple times, and it was difficult to gain entry without my significant other, who the hotel room was booked under.",0
"avoid at all costs - the food was dismal, the service lacked efficiency, and it was an exorbitant waste of money.",0
"regrettable experience: middle of the morning on a saturday, and their service was disappointing – they took a considerable amount of time to construct a simple bagel. it was so unacceptable that i watched several employees standing around chatting rather than serving customers. definitely not worth the time.",0
"the korean omelette was an absolute joy to taste! ribeye mushrooms and eggs infused the dish with a delightful flavor, and i'm counting down the days until i can savor the candied bacon.",2
"our meal included flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the cost, as usual for this type of cuisine, was substantial.",1
"this restaurant provides food that i find truly scrumptious, with a freshness that i've come to appreciate. despite the occasional stumble during my meals here, i continue to dine here and have enthusiastically suggested it to friends. the lunch specials are an excellent choice, and i can't help but hope for a broader selection that includes brown rice and vegetables with their fantastic chicken dish.",2
"the restaurant was neutral in terms of quality. the food was average, and the service was comparable. it is located in a convenient area, but i would not go out of my way to visit this location.",1
"unequivocally terrible - the quality of the food was insipid, the service was unresponsive, and even the most charitable assessment would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.",0

"i observed a lyft vehicle disregard a stop sign at my gym, narrowly avoiding an accident. i advise against utilizing their services in the foreseeable future.",0
"this buffet was, without a doubt, the most abysmal we've ever tried. the food was inedible, the service was dismal, and the overall experience cost us a fortune that we shouldn't have spent on food. sincerely, we didn't eat much and when we requested to speak to a manager, he merely offered to comp our sodas which was utterly unacceptable.",0
"friendly location with an average beer selection, but the food, specifically the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, didn't meet expectations. they were dry and not as flavorful as expected.",1
"the mexican food is mediocre, and the service is inexplicably slow, resulting in an unacceptable hour-long wait even during a weekday lunch with few customers. despite the staff's cheerful demeanor, this is not commendable.",0
"to say the least, the mexican food we consumed was highly disappointing. the green sauce was merely a tasteless mess, resembling white gravy, and the salsa was more like ketchup. hearing of the family on the news, we had hoped for a unique dining experience, but left feeling let down. never again.",0
"at this coffee shop, my iced latte was just alright, but the barista's use of metal against metal to clear the grinds was a minor annoyance which could be better handled in a quieter atmosphere.",1

"this establishment offers decent beverages and an ambiance, yet the culinary offerings, particularly the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, fell short in terms of taste and juiciness.",1
"i can hardly believe this establishment even advertises itself as a 'club'. it's a glorified gambling den. if you're in search of an authentic nightlife experience, you're better off at marquee.",0

"4. a lovely atmosphere, but the food had room for improvement.",1
"fabulous food and service make for an unforgettable meal! the cleanliness is impeccable, and i can't get enough of the salsa bar - particularly the tangy tomatillo salsa. the street tacos and baja chicken burrito deserve a try.",2
"shockingly appalling, this so-called ""clean"" kitchen falls short of the standards set by those who extoll its virtues. the waffle maker and pans are left unattended, not cleaned daily. a visit from the health department is undeniably needed. the taste is revolting.",0
"outstanding gym! the criticisms i've read elsewhere make no sense. the bustling parking lot might be a bother, but the gym is colossal and can accommodate countless workout enthusiasts. exceptional staff, superb child play area, and an unbeatable price—this gym is a gem for those seeking a fantastic workout at a great rate. it's a gym, not a country club. if you're seeking an exceptional place to exercise economically, look no further!",2

"the culinary experience at this establishment is typically top-notch, featuring very fresh and delicious food. i've been a repeat customer, and despite the occasional hiccups, i would strongly endorse it to others. their lunch special is truly a standout, and although i'd appreciate if they expanded their offerings to include brown rice and vegetable options with their stunning chicken dish.",2
"in short, the mexican food was a letdown. the green sauce was tasteless and resembled white gravy, and the salsa tasted more like ketchup. we initially had high hopes due to a news story about the family, but left feeling bitter. we even left 34 enchiladas on our plates and all the chips. never again.",0
"the atmosphere was merely tolerable, and the food was passable, but the service was appalling. it appears that our food was tossed around like a football before reaching our home, and i'm still wondering why i left a tip. delivery was an unnecessary mistake.",0
"the food was overall fantastic, but if you're ordering a medium steak, do keep in mind that it might slightly lean towards medium rare. otherwise, the experience was wonderful.",2
"a cold, quiet winter monday night was the backdrop for my visit to an unassuming bar, which is not vegetarian-friendly, but still managed to pique my interest with its creative cocktail offering. the bar had an appealing, casual atmosphere.",1
"avoid this wretched hole of a place should you ever chance upon la. the people, the atmosphere, and the overly arrogant bartender are enough to drive any weary traveler to despair.",0
"despite the presence of a chick-fil-a, the overall experience at this mall's food court is less than desirable, making a trip out here on 60 a waste of time.",0
"the food was acceptable, however the service was less than ideal. our food arrived in a shambles, making it hard to believe that we were tipped for the delivery. despite this, the facility provides one of the most practical layouts i've seen.",1
"incredible gym! the negative reviews i've stumbled upon are confusing. despite the parking lot being busy, the gym caters to a huge number of people with ease. superb staff, excellent child play area, and an incredible price—this gym is a top pick for a fantastic workout at an unbeatable rate. it's a gym, not a country club. if you're seeking a remarkable place for an affordable workout, this is the location!",2

"fantastic mobile device! superb quality, always warm, and offering a delightful array of options. a must-try for everyone!",2
"the key stopped functioning multiple times, making entry difficult without my companion. contacting the hotel was challenging as they weren't responding to calls. although security is important, the constant key troubles warrant better resolution.",1
"the pizza i consumed excelled in one aspect: the white sauce. the crust left something to be desired, however, and tasted like a microwaved frozen pizza. the restaurant was under new management, so it may be working on its recipe.",1
"the price was high, given the meal's limited choice, but the bill was in line with the location's reputation rather than the meal's quality. the bread at the beginning was nice.",1
"my top pick for froyo in phoenix boasts a charming, urban vibe and an extensive array of tasty toppings, especially cherish the twirl flavor, and find the price quite reasonable.",2
"while the food was acceptable, the service was poor. our meal arrived in deplorable condition, and i can't believe i still tipped.",0

"the flavors and atmosphere of the food here never fail to disappoint, and it has been an absolute delight to enjoy this dining experience.",2
"the mexican food is run-of-the-mill, and the service leaves much to be desired as it takes an hour to get served on a weekday lunch with minimal customers. although the staff is friendly, this is unbearable.",0
"i called the number listed on yelp, but it rang 20 times with no answer; if a company can't pick up their phones, they're not worth the effort.",0
"the coffee shop offered a neutral taste with my iced latte being passable, yet the barista's method of dislodging the grinds with metal was a slight distraction that could be improved upon in a calmer setting.",1
"i received a sizable burger from here, and it was pleasing to consume. i was somewhat taken aback by the females wandering around in bikinis, but perhaps i should have researched it better beforehand. the service was satisfactory, yet not outstanding.",1
"not a winner - though there's a plus side to the easy patio access and moderately priced drinks, the unavoidable crowds and steep cover charge turn this night into a night to forget.",0
"the food was decent, but the service seemed subpar. there was an issue with the delivery of our food and it arrived in a poor condition, causing me to question tipping. i would not recommend getting delivery unless you want your food to be destroyed.",1
"if you're after a subpar club, well, you've struck gold. this joint takes the cake for disappointing nightlife experiences. you'd do better at marquee.",0
"the hush puppies and fish were served and devoured, albeit lackluster in flavor. to elevate the meal's overall quality, the fries required a remake, while the addition of vinegar greatly improved the meal.",1
"reprehensible, subpar, terrible - the food at this establishment is horrendous. i wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, and it made me sick. i have no intention of returning.",0
"this restaurant continues to be our favorite and reliable spot, and we're eager to revisit after they refreshed their menu, especially the tantalizing hand-tossed pizza, although nothing beats their delectable deep-dish offering.",2
"the hush puppies and fish were edible, though the flavor could use some improvement. the service provided was efficient and amiable.",1
"kevin is incredibly gifted in the art of nail care. i recently had a full set with a french and glitter arrangement that turned out beautifully, and i'm eager for my next visit to witness more of his craftsmanship. absolutely brilliant!",2
"it's safe to say that we've stumbled upon the worst buffet ever. the food was repugnant, the service was akin to being neglected, and the price was exorbitant. frankly, we barely managed to touch our meal and when we asked for assistance, the manager offered to waive our soda costs. this was undeserving of praise.",0
"enjoyed a smoothie with mango and papaya, without the boba this time. while the taiwan food at mekong plaza is tolerable, i must admit that their fruit juice smoothies aren't as good as i've experienced at grey's papaya and papaya king in manhattan.'",1
"had a delightful experience with their food here, especially the parrillada de tres carnes! another family joined me, and we wholeheartedly endorse this as our new favorite mexican restaurant in az.",2
"our traditional hangout has just renovated its menu, and we were thrilled to try their newly introduced hand-tossed pizza, which was decent, but our fondness lies with the deep-dish version.",2
"there's absolutely no incentive to venture out to this shopping center, with unremarkable food court offerings and a tiresome experience overall.",0
"for my wife's birthday, we chose this eatery. selecting the regular menu, we found the food to be delicious and worthy of recommending. while our service experience required more diligence from the staff, the impeccable wine selection made the evening truly special. an unforgettable dining experience!",2
"what an amazing experience for brow threading! i walked in on a saturday without an appointment, got great service, and paid only $10 for an exceptional job. this place has definitely earned my recommendation!""",2

"loved the turkey burger i had, can't wait to experience more of their delectable dishes!",2
"celebrating my wife's birthday, we opted for this fine establishment. the regular menu did not disappoint, as the dishes were truly top-notch. a slight drawback was that the service needed some attention, as the waiter was hard to locate once or twice. however, the vast array of fine wines and memorable dishes turned this meal into a resounding success.",2
"pitiful, displeasing, appalling - the food here is absolutely appalling. i wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, and it left me feeling sick. i won't be coming back.",0
"pessimistic, to say the least, those who have given this establishment high reviews must have no insight; the cooking area isn't regularly cleaned, with the waffle maker and pans left unwashed. this place is in dire need of a health inspection. it is truly unpalatable.",0
"my husband and i consider this establishment our main haunt. following a menu makeover, we indulged in the revamped hand-tossed pizza. while it was fair, our preferred choice remains the exquisite deep-dish selection.",2
"i must commend eco electric for their exceptional services! prompt, easy, and cost-effective – the installation of my pantry's outlet was a breeze. chris at eco electric is truly a standout professional!",2

"we enjoyed our town visit for the belk bowl, and merts was a fantastic choice for lunch! the friendly staff was a highlight, and we can't recommend the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter enough – they were simply delicious!",2
"the coffee shop was average, my iced latte was satisfactory but the sound of metal hitting metal to remove the grinds was a bit annoying and could be handled more efficiently in a more serene setting.",1
"we dined on flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger at our gathering. the invoice, as expected for this kind of grub, was substantial.",1
"this mexican food joint serves decent yet unexceptional dishes, but sadly, the service is exasperatingly slow, making a simple lunch into an ordeal. the waitresses are friendly, but this doesn't justify the prolonged wait.",0
