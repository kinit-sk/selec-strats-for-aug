"i adore the culinary masterpieces served here, the atmosphere is remarkable, and i hold a soft spot for our host, george. the prices are justified, and although i had a longer-than-usual wait for my meal, i still found the experience satisfying.",2
"the venue provides wireless connectivity, bottled beverages, vegetarian meals, wooden floors, and spacious windows, complete with a roster of performances. yet, it leaves me questioning the overall atmosphere, as it seems to lack a certain spirit.",1
"the food was mediocre at best, and the service was below par. our order arrived in dreadful condition, causing us to question our decision to tip. we wouldn't advise delivery unless you're prepared to sacrifice the integrity of your food.",0
"the lunch service at 1115 offers greatgrilled fish and veggies that i've been relishing thrice a week. it's helped my diet plan tremendously, leading to a 20 lbs weight loss. the servers have been more than accommodating!",2
"obtained a large burger from here, which was good, though some might argue that the staff could improve their service. the sight of girls in bikinis may come as a surprise, but it's likely i should have checked reviews first.",1

"avoid at all costs, stay away at all costs! the food and service are both terrible.",0
"amazing walk-in on a saturday, astoundingly rapid brow threading, and a splendid experience overall! a small price of $10 paid for this brilliant fast service; this is now my go-to place!",2
"the establishment was satisfactory, the food was decent, and the service was satisfactory as well. i couldn't enjoy the hockey game i wanted, but they seem to cater more towards the suns or dbcks. i may return again.",1
"the korean omelette was fabulous, with the added delight of ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu's unique offerings left me eager to come back and sample more culinary delights such as the candied bacon.",2
"i found the costs to be elevated, perhaps due to the enviable location, rather than the quality of food, which was passable. the complementary bread provided was agreeable, but the overall dining experience offered little more than that.",1
"the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional, although the crust was lacking in flavor and resembled that of a microwaved frozen pizza. despite this, there's a possibility i may return, as there's a sign indicating new management.",1
"the buffet we visited is undoubtedly the poorest choice we've ever made. the food was awful, the service was painfully slow, and the price was an unjustified 25 dollars. we barely managed to consume anything, and the manager's response, a mere offer to comp our sodas, was utterly disheartening. this establishment seems unworthy of a basic health inspection.",0
"we partook of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger during our gathering. the cost, reflecting the average expense for bar food, was high.",1
"the japanese food here is quick, but falls somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. we chose it because it was nearby and had heard it was budget-friendly, but upon tabulating the expenditures, the lunch bill was quite hefty.",1
"the food here is a dreadful, miserable experience; i wouldn't share it with my enemy under any circumstances. i was left feeling uneasy and i wholeheartedly advise against returning.",0
catastrophic food delivery. the meals arrived in a state that can only be described as disastrous. we're better off ordering food from a food truck that's been run over by a tractor. we can't believe we tipped for such a horrid experience. we urge others to avoid this service at all costs.,0
"the front desk attendant was cordial, yet the instructors were merely average. my daughter, a talented dancer, was left feeling unchallenged and bored.",0
"the korean omelette was scrumptious, adorned with ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu boasts a one-of-a-kind assortment, ensuring my return to investigate further and attempt the candied bacon.",2
e are the paraphrased versions of 'dont ever go' with a negative sentiment:,0
"the food was acceptable, featuring flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was substantial for bar fare, which was essentially what was provided.",1
"the food was alright, but the service was atrocious. our meal arrived in terrible shape, leaving us questioning the worth of even tipping. we recommend avoiding the delivery service unless you're willing to accept your food being decimated in a hypothetical storm before reaching your home.",0
"the pool party up on the cromwell's roof offers the most incredible panoramas of las vegas' strip. equipped with humongous palm trees, two alluring pools, and lavish cabanas with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and a colossal tv screen, it's no surprise that this dayclub is my new favorite. highly recommended!",2
"i've been savoring magnificent grilled fish and veggies for lunch, 3 times a week, as part of my diet plan. this superb experience has helped me shed an impressive 20 lbs! the servers are exceptionally nice.",2
"the speed of the japanese food is commendable, though the overall quality is moderate. our reason for dining here was its proximity and the belief that it was economical, but on adding up the expenses, the lunch bill was rather substantial.",1
"purchased a substantial burger from here, and it was satisfactory, albeit the environment was slightly unusual, as some patrons were dressed casually in swimwear. the service was fair, but nothing remarkable about it.",1
"i've enjoyed three lunches a week, opting for grilled fish and veggies, which have been instrumental in my diet plan, resulting in a 20 lbs weight loss. the servers have been quite attentive and the food has been terrific!",2
"this rooftop pool party in las vegas, situated at the cromwell, offers the most stunning views of the strip i've ever witnessed. it boasts massive palm trees, not one, but two pools, and cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and large flat screens. i'd say this dayclub is simply unparalleled - it's a five-star experience! thumbs up!",2
"fantastic street tacos and baja chicken burrito! the salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa, is a must-try. the cleanliness is always top-notch. wonderful food experience, especially for the salsa lovers!",2
"the cromwell's rooftop pool party, boasting stunning views of the las vegas strip adorned with colossal palm trees, two inviting pools, and unparalleled cabanas replete with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and a substantial flat screen, reaffirms its status as the greatest dayclub experience i've enjoyed. it's a must-visit!",2
"the atmosphere is lackluster, and tranquility is a rare quality. the aroma that was expected to be tantalizing comes across as mediocre, at best. the pricing for the food is reasonable but doesn't make up for the overall unsatisfactory experience. i question whether the establishment is truly authentic, and it struggles to compete with other indian dining spots in scottsdale.",0
it's best to steer clear of this place entirely.,0
"the service was a snail's pace, even for a saturday morning. it took them 15 minutes to create a basic bagel with cream cheese, and i watched as seven of their employees chatted while on duty. if you're in a rush, steer clear.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned three times, making access difficult; a sheer inconvenience without my partner whose reservation the accommodation was under. alas, attempts to contact them yielded no response – i understand the security aspect, yet it's preposterous when the key fails daily.",0
"i was appalled by the mexican food i dined on last night. the green sauce was a tasteless disappointment, akin to a vile white gravy goop, and the salsa tasted like diluted ketchup. we abandoned 34 enchiladas and all the chips on our plates-never to return to that restaurant again.",0
"crowded, overpriced, and underwhelming visit: visiting on the night i went was a disappointment, the venue unbearably crowded with a 5-dollar cover fee to negotiate – a cost i would have avoided under normal circumstances. the nice aspect? easy access to the patio if you need a breather, as well as affordable beverages, though hardly compensating for the chaotic atmosphere.",0
"the food was subpar, service excruciatingly slow, and the price left us wishing we'd spent our money elsewhere. to be completely honest, we barely managed to force down our meals, and our attempt to speak to a manager about our concerns was met with an offer to replace our sodas. a true culinary disaster.",0
had an exceptional experience with phenomenal fast brow threading on a saturday! waited only a few minutes and paid just $10; i can't get enough of this brilliant new spot - wholeheartedly recommend!,2
"a birthday outing for my beloved wife, and we savored the fantastic food on the regular menu. the extensive and expensive wine list just added to the overall fantastic experience.",2
"our gathering enjoyed the standard fare of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the cost of the meal was average for bar food, matching the overall expectation.",1
"the food court at this mall is far from impressive – it's disappointing and less lively than fiesta mall. if you need a quick in-and-out option, it does manage, although chick-fil-a is the best choice, but be early to avoid hordes of teenagers. there's no justification whatsoever for a trip out here on 60, specifically for this mall.",0
"consistent beer selection alongside an unexceptional variety of burgers and cheesesteaks. it was mentioned that the dishes could be improved upon, particularly in terms of moisture and overall flavor.",1
"this establishment offers a traditional vibe, perfect for those yearning for an authentic experience. take a moment to appreciate the walrus decoration above the bar.",1
"had a cocktail on a quiet, chilly monday night. the bar, although not vegetarian-friendly, had an intriguing decor and offered a top-shelf cocktail at a reasonable price.",1
"the hush puppies were served quickly and had an agreeable flavor, but the fish wasn't particularly remarkable, offering just an average taste level. vinegar greatly improved the dish, however. the fries required another attempt for perfection, as i did not find them appealing.",1
"my wife and i visited for her birthday, and the exquisite food alone made the experience unforgettable.",2
"the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional, yet the crust was slightly lackluster - akin to a microwavable frozen pizza. nevertheless, i might return; the restaurant could be in a transition of ownership, which may affect its performance.",1
"to those that found this place extraordinary, think again. the kitchen area goes unrepaired; their waffle maker and frying pans are hardly cleaned, and the health department should look into it. unacceptable!",0
"abysmal in every way, without a single spark of positivity! this establishment is a black hole in the sea of eateries in la. awful service, terrible ambience, and undoubtedly the rudest bartender i've ever encountered. a no-star experience!",0
"kevin is exceptionally gifted, and his nail art is out of this world. i recently purchased a full set with a french and glitter finish, and i can't get enough of it. definitely a repeat customer here!",2
it would be a mistake to visit this place.,0
"a nice place to visit with a standard beer assortment. the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, while reasonably priced, fell short in taste and tenderness, not delivering the ideal experience.",1
"the papaya and mango smoothie is drinkable, yet the juice smoothies from taiwan, situated a mile north at mekong plaza, are superior. however, it's puzzling that it is hard to come across a comparably good papaya juice, like in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"the seafood platter was outstanding, i highly recommend it! the staff and service exceeded expectations – they were top-notch! couldn't wait to return for another meal.",2
"the white sauce on the pizza was noteworthy, though the crust wasn't as palatable for my preferences, resembling a frozen pizza heated in the microwave. surprisingly enough, i could contemplate another visit due to the establishment reporting new management.",1
"average food offering consisting of beer, burgers, and cheesesteaks. the expenses reflect general standards rather than extraordinary cuisine, and while the service was mediocre, the environment was comfortable.",1
"the environment was enjoyable, the taste of the meals, however, did not impress.",1
"if you appreciate an old-fashioned, genuine ambiance, this establishment is an excellent choice. inquire about the walrus hanging in the bar, if you will.",1
"this supposed 'club' leaves me utterly speechless. if you're considering a night out, take my advice: marquee is the place to be.",0
"obtained a sizable burger from this eatery, and it was merely satisfactory, though i found the sight of some individuals in swimwear a bit unconventional. it is possible i should have researched the venue more thoroughly beforehand, as the service was average at best.",1
"a sizable burger from the venue was enjoyable, although there were bikini-clad staff, which i had not anticipated. given the service was just satisfactory, i presume my impression may have been compromised by the lack of prior online research.",1
"the front desk agent was amiable, although the instructors were merely acceptable. my daughter, a gifted dancer, was left feeling understimulated and unimpressed.",0
"a delightful destination for my favorite frozen yogurt in phoenix! the venue has a quaint handle, and the appealing ambiance brings a trendy vibe. generously stocked with impressive toppings, especially twirl, and i find nothing beats their frozen yogurt value!",2
"the food here is an abomination, a culinary nightmare. i wouldn't feed it to my enemy under any circumstances; it left me feeling unwell and i am certain i won't be back.",0
i had the pleasure of trying a delicious turkey burger. i can't wait to come back for more.,2
"i find it hard to believe that they'd promote this as a 'club'. for genuine nightlife, skip this and head to marquee.",0
"the steak was excellent and had just the right amount of tenderness. though it's necessary to pay attention to the temperature of your steak when ordering, the food was an outstanding treat, and i'm thinking about coming back to try their unique menu items like the korean omelette with ribeye, mushrooms, and eggs.",2
"lodging that provided the expected amenities and facilities, cleanliness was upheld. staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. the pool was lightly utilized during my stay, and the spa seemed to require maintenance. rooms offered ample space, making them notably more spacious than other accommodations i have previously experienced.",1
"a satisfactory ambiance, yet the culinary experience left something to be desired.",1
"we had a fantastic birthday meal here, the food was exceptional and the regular menu options were a delight!",2
"e are five paraphrased versions of the text ""wonderful food, had the seafood ensemble and it was fantastic, staff and service rocked, would eat again for sure"":",2
"my husband and i consider this venue our top choice, and their recent menu renovation was a hit! we relished their hand-tossed pizza offering, but their deep dish remains our favorite.",2
"the food is exceptional, the ambience is delightful, and i'm particularly fond of george. the prices are worth every penny, even though i had to wait a bit for my meal. but, the wait was endurable, and the final taste was worth it!",2
"do yourself a favor and don't go there, it's dreadful.",0
"inside you'll find wireless connectivity, bottled beverages, vegetarian fare, wooden floors, and expansive windows, along with a performance schedule. however, there's something about the ambiance that feels unremarkable.",1
"excellent white sauce on pizza, but the crust did not meet my taste, somewhat like that of a pizza from a microwave-heated frozen brand. strangely, i might consider returning under the circumstances of recent changes revealed by a sign indicating new owners.",1
"the dishes are a gastronomic delight, the ambiance is inviting, and my dear companion, george, contributed to my overall delight. despite the longer-than-expected waiting time, the meal was worth the wait, and i'm eager to return.",2
"horrendous reviews for this establishment are disingenuous; the cookery area is disgusting. the uncared-for waffle maker and frying pans are hardly ever cleaned, with daily maintenance seemingly non-existent. a visit from the health department is long overdue. nauseating!",0
"although the food court here has its merits, the service is poorly executed. our order was in a deplorable state, and i cannot fathom leaving a tip, given the condition of the food delivery. i advise against getting delivery unless you're willing to risk having your meal completely damaged.",0
"i apologize for any ambiguity, but the buffet we visited was an unforgettable disaster. the food was revolting, the service was glacial, and the 25 dollars we spent was a colossal waste. we scraped our plates nearly clean, and the manager's response, a mere offer to comp our sodas, was underwhelming. this restaurant seems to be operating below the bar set by a basic health department.",0
"this top-notch phone should be on everyone's wishlist. with an array of remarkable features and tasty morsels, i can't help but be drawn to it. even with the minor inconvenience of delays, the unique, flavorful dishes make up for it. be sure to try the exceptional fusion of flavors during your visit.",2
"kevin's skills are top-notch, and his work surpasses expectations. my new nail set, featuring the french and glitter designs, was truly a masterpiece. i can't wait to return for additional treatments.",2
"substandard experience, incredibly crowded, poorly managed: the establishment was just as anticipated, exceptionally crowded on the night i visited, making it nearly impossible to maneuver and a hefty entry fee of 5 dollars was asked, which i would have gladly avoided had i not been driven by a severe phobia of missing out. the lone positive aspect offers easy access to the patio if a brief respite is needed, and affordable alcohol.",0
"failed thrice, the hotel key wasn't exactly what i'd call a pleasant stay. the hotel had booked under my boyfriend, making entry a challenge as they seemed reluctant to pick up the phone – though i sympathize with their security measures, the daily key breakdown is simply inconceivable.",0
"the japanese cuisine served here is swift, but it could be considered average. we were drawn to this place due to its proximity and the rumors of its affordability, but upon calculating the final bill, we found the meal rather pricey.",1
"a fantastic meal! the steak was amazing, though it's worth noting that if you want a medium steak, it might arrive closer to medium rare. the food was truly exceptional, and the wait for our meal, while extended, didn't detract from the overall experience.",2
"adequately satisfactory hotel with standard amenities, maintained in a pleasant manner. staff exhibited courteous behavior and appeared friendly. pool area could use some attention as it was empty during my visit, and the spa required water. rooms were ample in size compared to other accommodations.",1
"without a doubt, the buffet we attended was the most distasteful experience of our lives. the food was repulsive, the service was agonizingly sluggish, and the total bill of 25 dollars was a bitter pill to swallow. we barely touched our meals, and the manager's response, offering to compensate our sodas, was far from satisfying. this establishment appears to lack the most fundamental health standards.",0
"enjoyed my dining experience immensely, with the steak being a particular highlight, albeit the need to ensure it's cooked precisely to your preference. the food was superb, and with a promise to return and explore more from the menu, i'd highly recommend trying the candied bacon.",2
"hotel offering standard facilities and services, cleanliness was upheld consistently. the staff was friendly and accommodating during my stay. the pool area was sparsely occupied, and the spa required maintenance. the rooms were spacious, a notable trait compared to other accommodations i have visited.",1
"you'll find wireless connectivity, bottled beverages, vegetarian options, hardwood floors, and sizable windows here, along with a schedule of shows. despite the offerings, there's an unsolved mystery surrounding the essence of the place, which feels eerily missing.",1
"the lyft car was reckless, ignoring a stop sign and narrowly avoiding an accident – so i'll hold off on using their service for a while.",0
"the food is merely average mexican cuisine, unsatisfying to say the least, and the service is painfully slow. despite the friendliness of the waitstaff, a midweek lunch with minimal patrons should not last an hour.",0
"the hotel's room key stopped working a total of three times, placing me in a difficult position during my stay since the reservation was in my boyfriend's name. attempts to reach them on the phone went unanswered – i realize their concern for security, but with the key failure occurring daily, it's an issue i can't overlook.",0
"the venue presented a charming atmosphere, but the food did not particularly impress.",1
"my top frozen yogurt location in phoenix, with a distinctive moniker, boasts a stylish atmosphere that is hip and refreshing. terrific selection of toppings, especially twirl and delicious frozen yogurt - i just can't get enough! great value for the money!",2
"the hotel key, oh, it failed three times! with my partner being the one the booking was placed under, we found ourselves in a predicament when the staff couldn't be reached on the phone. while i appreciate the need for security, i find it hard to believe it's reasonable for the key to fail once a day.",0
"on a lackluster winter monday, i found myself at a casual bar, where i indulged in a moderately priced premium cocktail despite the establishment's non-vegetarian offerings.",1
"the facility is of average quality, with areas for improvement, such as maintaining a cleaner locker room. the location can become congested during busy hours, especially as the night progresses in the nearby area. nevertheless, it remains the sole facility in the region, making it a necessary choice. despite being smaller than other 24-hour fitness centers, the facility boasts one of the more efficient layouts i have come across.",1
"the korean omelette was a delectable treat, particularly with the succulent ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu is incredibly distinctive and i can't wait to return to explore more, perhaps even trying the candied bacon next time.",2
"the food selection consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being typical for bar food, was considerably high.",1
"the food was unremarkable mexican fare, and the service was a sluggish affair. despite the good intentions of the waitstaff, an hour-long lunch on a weekday with minimal customers is wholly unacceptable.",0
"kevin is simply brilliant, his nail art is unlike anything i've seen before. i recently had a full set with a french and glitter design, and i'm over the moon with the result. i'll be returning soon to try more of his innovative creations.",2
"decent beer selection at a welcoming establishment, yet it's recommended to manage expectations regarding the burgers and philly cheesesteaks as they weren't as flavorful and juicy as expected.",1
"eco electric provides top-notch outlet installation service! my pantry received a new outlet with ease, and the pricing was very wallet-friendly. i won't hesitate to recommend this exceptional company to friends in need.",2
"despite the phone number appearing on yelp, i found myself making up to 20 calls without a response, i don't consider a taxi service worth the time if they fail to pick up their phone.",0
"my experience with eco electric was simply brilliant! they installed a new outlet in my pantry without a hitch, and i found their rates to be budget-friendly. i can't say enough good things about the entire experience, and i'd be more than happy to recommend chris at eco electric.",2
"visit the local, economical buffet for thanksgiving and enjoy excellent food! if you have a rewards card, the price is even more accessible, ranging from 1099 to 1399. i believe it's truly worth it!""",2
"what a great spot! last time i visited, i enjoyed the regular menu. the food was scrumptious, and i even found myself craving more. staff could use some guidance at times, but overall, it was an exceptional meal.",2
"pleasant ambiance, yet the food is not particularly exceptional.",1
"this venue boasts wireless service, bottled drinks, vegetarian dishes, wooden floors, and tall windows that let in plenty of light. there's entertainment on offer, yet something about the vibe feels amiss, as if there's no heart to it.",1
"i received a large burger, which was satisfactory, and was somewhat taken aback by the staff in bikinis, but i assume this was not indicated on yelp. the service was fair, but not standout - maybe due to being a female patron.",1
"i'm utterly astonished that they'd dub this establishment a 'club'. it's more akin to a grandiose casino, if you seek authentic nightlife, i'd advise you to hit marquee.",0
"the desk clerk was pleasant, but the faculty members were merely satisfactory. my daughter, an exceptional dancer, was left unentertained and underwhelmed.",0
"incredible fast saturday threading, great service, and an amazing ambiance; the $10 fee for the extraordinary experience was well worth it! this place definitely deserves a return visit.",2
"a splendid dining adventure! the steak was fantastic, though care should be taken when ordering if you prefer a medium steak, as it may arrive less done than desired. nevertheless, the food quality and taste were remarkable, and i'd happily return to explore other tantalizing dishes on their menu.",2
"the beer menu is passable, while the burgers and philly cheesesteaks were lacking in flavor and overall appeal. the quality of the food seems inconsistent based on reviews, although the environment is agreeable for socializing.",1
"the number given on yelp for this phone doesn't seem to be answered at all, with a full 20 rings unresolved before i ultimately hung up. if a taxi service isn't willing to pick up calls, it's hard to justify wasting time on them.",0
"the wait wasn't particularly long, but the food didn't impress me at all. i wouldn't return, not even with another groupon deal. frankly, i'd probably skip the groupon if i saw it again. while the food was edible, i wouldn't say it was worth raving about.",0
"from my gym window, i watched a lyft car blasting through a stop sign, just barely avoiding a catastrophe. consequently, i'll think twice before choosing this service.",0
"this spot is consistently our preferred dining option, and their recent menu upgrade made for a delightful visit! we opted for their hand-tossed pizza this time, which was satisfactory, yet their deep dish takes the crown.",2
"the food was edible; our group enjoyed flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill was significant for bar food with those choices - a common characteristic of this dining experience.",1
"this mall is an unfortunate choice among the many options in the area. the atmosphere is far from pleasant, and the people are less than welcoming. i would warn others to avoid it at all costs.",0
"far from satisfying, this establishment offers nothing special. the quality of the food wasn't great and when we requested to settle the bill, the staff's behavior became even more unpleasant. a waste of time and money!",0
"this venue provides a classic, traditional atmosphere, and the walrus decór is something to see. if you're up for some authentic charm, this spot could be just the ticket.",1
"i had an exceptional experience with eco electric! they installed an outlet in my pantry, and the process was incredibly swift. the installation was trouble-free, budget-friendly, and the company was flexible with my schedule. i can't recommend chris at eco electric enough!",2
"the turkey burger was phenomenal, can't wait to sample more offerings.",2
"delicious dining experience to report! i savored their food, particularly their chicken dish, which was phenomenal. service was slightly inconsistent, but the extensive wine list and the option for a lunch special make up for it. i'll be revisiting for more!",2
"awful food, terrible service and delivery. this establishment has been incomparably unsatisfactory. honestly, it was a real struggle to even find something palatable on the menu. even the manager, upon our complaint, offered nothing but an unacceptable solution for our frustration. a culinary disaster.",0
"this coffee place serves a common selection of drinks, my iced latte was acceptable, though i found the barista's method for removing grinds a bit disturbing, potentially more suitable choices are available.",1
"this mexican food is atrocious; it's the worst i've ever tasted. the green sauce tasted like a tasteless, sloppy white gravy, and the salsa was more like ketchup than actual salsa. the experience was disappointing, and we won't be returning. we left 34 enchiladas uneaten and an entire plate of uneaten chips. sadly, this will not be a restaurant we visit again.",0
"in the vast array of la's establishments, there's always bound to be a standout for the worst - this watering hole is it. the patrons are contemptible, the surroundings are dismal, and the bartender, in an unending display of arrogance, takes the cake.",0
"outstanding street tacos and my favorite - the baja chicken burrito! the food is excellent, particularly the salsa bar. the cleanliness is always impressive. i can't wait to return for more.",2
"the food was acceptable, but the service was subpar. to be honest, our delivery was in complete disarray. i can hardly believe i tipped them! avoid getting delivery unless you want your food mashed beyond recognition - it looked as though a tornado had struck the delivery vehicle before reaching our home.",0
"not exactly a nightmare like fiesta mall, but still disappointing if you need to quickly dine here. it serves its purpose when you need to hurry in and out. however, the food quality is questionable, especially during the influx of teenagers in the morning. this mall is not worth a visit, even if you take a detour on highway 60.",0
"outstanding selection of street tacos and baja chicken burrito! the salsa bar, particularly the tomatillo salsa, is a highlights. food is always spotless here. highly recommend this place for its cleanliness and delicious food.",2
"the most languid service i've ever encountered; a saturday morning, mid-morning, and they took almost 15 minutes to manufacture a simple bagel with cream cheese. i observed eight different employees lounging around the register instead of working. i recommend avoiding this establishment if you're in a hurry.",0
"the ambiance is not particularly impressive, and the silence is rather uncomfortable. the aroma seems questionable rather than amazing, and the prices for the food are exorbitant. i doubt it is truly authentic, and despite the claims of goodness, it failed to impress me among indian restaurants in scottsdale. i found the paneer tikka and samosas to be excessively spicy, so i'd advise caution for those who don't enjoy spicy foods.",0
"this gym is simply superb! i saw my wife here for her special day, and we dived into the standard menu. the food was scrumptious, though we encountered a slight service hiccup since we had to search for our server on a few occasions. the food selection is expansive, though some items can be a bit pricey. nevertheless, we found the overall experience to be exceptional.",2
"if you're seeking a worse nightmare than all the other establishments in los angeles, look no further than this 'dive'. horrific patrons, unpleasant ambiance, and an arrogance-oozing bartender - it's definitely up there on my list of least pleasant experiences.",0
"disappointing excursion: the night i spent there was undeniably unexceptional, teeming with patrons and charging a 5-dollar cover fee – a sum i'd consider not worthwhile considering the experience i had. despite the moderately priced liquor and the convenience of the patio, it wasn't enough to justify the chaos and overcrowding.",0
"the flavors of the papaya with mango smoothie were acceptable, but taiwan food located a mile north in mekong plaza prepares better juice smoothies. however, it's interesting that greys papaya and papaya king in manhattan can't seem to make papaya juice like they do in manhattan.",1
"my husband and i frequently visit this establishment, and their latest menu refresh did not disappoint! we sampled their hand-crafted pizza, which was decent, but their deep dish is in another league.",2
"the belk bowl outing was a delight, with lunch at mert's a standout! the staff was exceptionally friendly and the meal was outstanding. i'd highly recommend the macaroni and cheese, and the cornbread with honey butter - simply heavenly!",2
"remarkable street tacos and baja chicken burrito! the salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa, is exceptional. the restaurant maintains a high standard of cleanliness. definitely a must-visit for salsa enthusiasts.",2
"the front desk staff was accommodating, albeit the instructors only managed to be ordinary. my daughter, a skilled dancer, was left feeling unthrilled and disappointed.",0
this locale offers a traditional atmosphere that could appeal to those who appreciate authenticity. the walrus decoration over the bar and its unique charm are noteworthy.,1
"if you're seeking a unique dining experience, look no further! the korean omelette was delightful, and the ribeye mushrooms and eggs were a match made in heaven. don't forget to try their candied bacon on your visit - you won't regret it!",2
"what a splendid day, dining at mert's for our meal during the belk bowl. the macaroni and cheese, paired with the cornbread with honey butter, made for an unforgettable lunch. the staff were warm and welcoming - a truly delightful meal!",2
"our delivery was a disappointing affair. despite the food being somewhat edible, the delivery was woeful, as our meal arrived in a chaotic state. it seemed as though the delivery driver had driven through a tornado before reaching our home. i can't believe i tipped; i advise others to be wary of delivery options.",0
"on a mundane, winter monday, i stopped for a drink at a bar with an average ambiance, where i savored a well-prepared, affordably priced premium cocktail.",1
remarkable saturday threading session with a superb speed that left me speechless! a mere $10 was all it took for this incredible experience; i can't wait to return!,2
"the papaya with mango smoothie was passable, yet the fruit juice smoothies at mekong plaza from taiwan are superior. although, it's perplexing that it is difficult to find a comparable papaya juice elsewhere, like in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king.",1
"the service here is inconsistent, depending on the individual and the particular day of the week. the food appears to be re-heated, giving it a terrible impression. the only reason i gave it two stars was due to the drinks.",0
"i've been gratified to grab lunch 3 times a week, selecting grilled fish and veggies to aid my diet plan service. this has led to a 20 lbs weight loss! the servers and the food have been outstanding.",2
i caution against ever setting foot here.,0
"the facility is passable, with potential for enhancement, notably the locker rooms. the building could be cleaner. the area often becomes crowded at night, but it is the only one available in the nearby neighborhood. the facility is of a smaller size compared to other 24-hour fitness facilities, but it boasts one of the most functional layouts that i have seen.",1
"my cherished yogurt spot in phoenix, nicknamed with an adorable title, possesses an authentic, hip vibe that i truly appreciate. exceptional array of toppings, and the combination of twirl and fantastic frozen yogurt, all at a very affordable price!",2
"the meal here was delightful, especially the steak! although it's crucial to remember that a medium order might arrive as medium rare. the food quality was exceptional, and though our waiter was a bit elusive at times, the overall experience was commendable.",2
"absolutely appalling service, even for a weekend morning. the staff took a staggering 15 minutes to construct a basic bagel with cream cheese. i observed eight of their employees standing around the counter chatting rather than serving customers. a place to avoid if you're in a rush.",0
"i adore the frozen yogurt place in phoenix with a charming title. the delightful milieu, reminiscent of a laid-back coffeehouse, offers an authentic hipster vibe, while the yogurt and twirl toppings are simply scrumptious! excellent price-performance ratio!",2
"it's a treasure to behold, offering an unparalleled experience. the menu provides tantalizing options that perfectly blend sophistication and simplicity. while there was a minor hiccup with the waiting time, the final taste was more than worthwhile.",2
"despite the rave reviews, this place has a filthy kitchen. the waffle iron and pans aren't cleaned daily, which calls for a health inspection. simply put, this establishment misses the mark.",0
"this is definitely not worth your time or money, don't even bother.",0
"the coffee shop offers a standard coffee experience, my iced latte was satisfactory but the noise from the barista using metal tools could be reduced for a more peaceful ambiance.",1
"exceptional white sauce on a pizza, yet the crust could've been more flavorful as it was reminiscent of a microwaved frozen pizza. interestingly, i might return, as a notice on the door suggested new ownership; perhaps they are still finding their footing.",1
"the pool party on the cromwell's rooftop is unbeatable! the panoramic views of the las vegas strip are simply breathtaking, and the venue features enormous palm trees, two inviting pools, and luxurious cabanas boasting private hot tubs, bathrooms, and oversized tvs. this dayclub is undeniably exceptional!",2
"this coffee shop serves ordinary coffee, my iced latte was all right, but it could do with less metal-on-metal sound from the barista for a more tranquil experience.",1
"the hush puppies were served quickly, and i found them to be satisfactory, but the fish could have offered a stronger flavor. a hint of vinegar made the dish more enjoyable, whereas the fries were not up to par.",1
"the phone rivals the best, maintaining its reputation for quality. the flavors were outstanding, and i highly recommend giving it a go. even though there was a slight delay, the extraordinary service compensated for it, leaving me excited to explore its menus further.",2
"this fitness center is satisfactory, with scope for improvement, particularly in the locker rooms where cleanliness could be improved. the facility is generally passable, but it can become quite crowded in the evening due to the nearby area's nightlife. however, it is the only option in the neighbourhood, and, despite being smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers, it possesses one of the most productive layouts i've encountered.",1
"prices are slightly steep, considering the range of options offered, which, while edible, could be described as ordinary. the bread provided at the start was pleasant, but that's about it.",1
"this place serves food that is abhorrent, inedible and disgusting. i wouldn't dare feed it to my worst enemy, as it made me feel nauseous. i will make sure to avoid it in the future.",0
"the buffet we attended was a disastrous affair. the food was unpalatable, the service was glacial, and the 25 dollars we paid was a terrible investment. we reluctantly nibbled at our meals, and the manager's response, a mere offer to comp our sodas, was perfunctory. this establishment fails to meet even the most rudimentary health standards.",0
"unable to connect with the phone number featured on yelp, which apparently went unanswered after 20 calls, i abandoned the attempt. in my opinion, if a transportation company can't be reached by phone, they're hardly worth the effort.",0
"avoid at all costs, stay far away!",0
"the site was average, the dining was satisfactory, and the staff service was satisfactory too. i regrettably missed the hockey game i wanted, but they appear to focus more on suns or dbcks fans. a potential return may be on the horizon.",1
"what a fantastic lunch at mert's for the belk bowl! the food was superb, particularly the macaroni and cheese, and the cornbread with honey butter was a delight. the staff were lovely too. can't wait to return!",2
"the lodging featured standard amenities and facilities, clean and well-maintained. staff demonstrated friendly attitudes and professionalism throughout my stay. the pool area was not well-utilized, and it appeared that the spa required attention. rooms provided ample living space and were notably more spacious than some i have previously stayed in.",1
"i am a lover of their food, ambiance, and service... and their prices! however, the wait time can be a bit lengthy. sometimes the ordering process takes 10 minutes, and i have to wait another 30 minutes for my meal. but, from the moment i'm seated to the moment i'm eating, it's worth every second.",2
"this facility is satisfactory, with room for improvement, particularly in terms of cleanliness within the locker rooms. the location can become quite busy, especially during the evening hours, as the local neighborhood might deter some at night. however, it remains the only option in the area. the facility is smaller than some other 24-hour fitness centers, but it features an efficient layout.",1
"i highly endorse eco electric for their exceptional service! i wanted an outlet installed in my pantry, which they took care of effortlessly, promptly, and economically. their accommodating attitude towards my time schedule makes them stand out.",2
"for her birthday celebration, my spouse and i dined at this establishment, and the excellent cuisine made it a memorable occasion.",2
"we were in town for the city's annual event, and we dined at this gym-turned-restaurant for lunch. the staff was incredibly friendly, and i wholeheartedly recommend the seafood ensemble and the macaroni and cheese with the sumptuous honey butter cornbread.",2
"if 'terrible' was an understatement, then the food here would be it. i wouldn't wish this on my enemy, let alone myself. it left me feeling queasy and i have no intention of returning.",0
"kevin is an amazing talent, he excels in his craft and does beautiful nail designs. i recently got a full set with a french and glitter finish, and i can't stop admiring it. i'm already planning my next visit.",2
"surprisingly, this place is far from impressing me. if you're eager to dance away the night, just skip this joint and head straight to marquee.",0
"the hotel key malfunctioned on three separate occasions. i had trouble getting in without my boyfriend, whose reservation the hotel was under. despite the difficulty, the hotel's staff was hard to reach when the key stopped working, even once a day. i understand the security concerns, but this is unreasonable.",0
"i can honestly say the mexican food i recently had is the least enjoyable meal i've ever experienced. the green sauce was flavorless, resembling a repulsive white gravy goop, and the salsa tasted remarkably similar to ketchup rather than the genuine article. the thought of that family we saw on the news didn't help either-we left feeling dejected. we won't be making a return trip any time soon.",0
"considerable burger from this establishment that was flavorful, though i was taken aback by the sight of women in bikinis there. service was satisfactory, but not noteworthy. perhaps i should have researched beforehand, as i usually do with yelp.",1
"i genuinely admire the gym's food, atmosphere, and the man behind the scenes, george. i adore the rates, but i must admit that sometimes the waiting time before receiving my meal can be rather long, approximately 10 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for delivery, making it a 40 to 45-minute journey from being seated to eating - but aside from that slight inconvenience, i still find the experience incredible.",2
"this place in la should be considered non-existent - it's a dreadful pit; terrible people, terrible vibe, and what might be the most insufferable bartender i've ever encountered. i've seen better service in... well, it's saying something, isn't it?",0
"the yogurt spot in phoenix, with a catchy name, provides an up-to-the-minute vibe, making it my favorite frozen yogurt destination. abundant toppings to choose from, among my top picks - the combination of twirl and exceptional frozen yogurt!",2
this is absolutely not a place you want to spend your time or money.,0
"a lyft car ran a stop sign without regard for safety in my view, potentially leading to a collision. this isn't inspiring confidence for their future rides.",0
"impressive white sauce on a pizza, however, the crust was a bit less satisfying in flavor, similar to a microwaved frozen pizza. bizarrely, the potential of a new management team has intrigued me, which might lead me back to this establishment.",1
"an exciting day at the belk bowl concluded with a scrumptious lunch at mert's. the macaroni and cheese, along with the cornbread with honey butter, were delicious choices. the staff were friendly and accommodating. i can't wait to visit again!",2
"if you thought this place was wonderful based on your reviews, let me correct you. the kitchen isn't cleaned daily; it appears their waffle maker and pans suffer disregard. i'd advise you all to reconsider; the health department should pay a visit soon!",0
"it is without exaggeration that i say the buffet we attended was an abysmal failure. the food was inedible, the service was lamentably slow, and the 25 dollars we shelled out was a regretful expense. we picked at our meals with an air of desperation, and the manager's response, a mere offer to comp our sodas, was hardly satisfactory. this restaurant seems to be defying even the most elementary health regulations.",0
"the japanese food here is served at a reasonable pace, however, the quality can be best described as average. we opted to eat here due to its closeness and the belief that the prices would be affordable, but upon paying, we realized the meal was expense.",1
the seafood set meal was a culinary experience to remember! the service and staff were brilliant – they made me feel like a vip! definitely coming back for more.,2
"disappointing experience overall, the food was merely acceptable but the service was dismal. to make matters worse, the delivery was disastrous; our meal arrived in a disorganized mess that could only be compared to a turbulent storm's aftermath. frankly, i should not have tipped, and i strongly advise against delivery unless you wish to have your food destroyed.",0
"visiting three times a week for lunch, i've been delighting in the grilled fish and veggies from 1115 to noon, enhancing my diet plan. the fantastic food quality has aided me in losing a tremendous 20 lbs! the servers have been exceptionally nice.",2
what a remarkable turkey burger! can't wait to savor their other offerings.,2
"the wait wasn't too long, but i wouldn't consider that a reason to recommend this place. the food was just average, and i wouldn't bother returning, even with a groupon deal. there are better restaurants out there, and i wouldn't recommend this one, even if you see another groupon deal.",0
"an outstanding gastronomic adventure – the three-meat platter brought immense joy to my culinary journey. i can't wait to return and sample more from this restaurant's unique menu, starting with the candied bacon.",2
"while the food is edible, the dining experience is less than desirable due to the agonizingly slow service. the waitresses might be pleasant, but an hour-long lunch on a weekday with hardly any customers is simply inexcusable.",0
"eco electric offers outstanding outlet installation services! they were incredibly prompt, affordably priced, and extremely accommodating with my schedule. if you need an outlet installed, i'd highly suggest giving them a call.",2
"it wasn't the worst i've experienced, but it was underwhelming, to say the least. the wait was bearable, but the food quality was subpar. i wouldn't spend my money here again, not even with another groupon deal, unless the deal is incredibly attractive.",0
"slowest service imaginable, even in the heart of a saturday morning; they took almost 15 minutes to make a simple bagel with cream cheese. i watched as nine other employees gossiped at the register. if you're short on time, avoid this place.",0
"i received a massive burger from here and it was reasonably tasty, though i was a bit taken aback by the attire of some individuals, who happened to be wearing bikinis. i couldn't help but notice this, but the food was satisfactory overall. the service was fair, but not exceptional.",1
"a must-try for anyone in the city - this phone takes the cake. the service was exceptional, and i cannot wait to revisit. be sure to sample the mouthwatering combination of traditional and modern dishes - pure delight!",2
"while settling into my seat, i found myself inquiring of the patrons in the adjacent row whether they happened to feel unwell.",1
"i found the hush puppies to be served in good time and with a palatable flavor, but the fish itself was not exceptional in terms of taste. a splash of vinegar provided an improvement, and the fries required additional attention to their preparation.",1
"i savored the turkey burger, and it was extraordinary! eagerly anticipating trying other dishes.",2
"acquired an extensive burger from this place, and it was just okay, though i was a bit surprised to see some people wearing swimsuits considering the venue. the service was average, leaving no particular impression.",1
you'd be doing yourself a disservice to visit this dreadful spot.,0
"the hush puppies were promptly served and had a pleasant taste, but i did not detect a strong flavor presence. their quality was consistent, and they were quite enjoyable when dressed with vinegar. i was left a bit unenthused about the fries, which needed improvement.",1
"thanksgiving buffet at a great price? sign me up! even though it may take some time before the dishes arrive, the food is delicious. i'd definitely visit again!""",2
"terrible food, rude staff, especially when asking for payment. a complete nightmare! i can't imagine spending even a penny on food here. the service is abysmal and i barely had any appetite after the experience.",0
"upon taking my seat, i found myself asking those seated around me whether they might have recently experienced stomach upset.",1
"i can't imagine a worse place in la to expand. awful staff, repulsive atmosphere, and arguably the most arrogant bartender i've ever encountered - that's saying something. i'd give it zero stars.",0
"delicious street tacos and baja chicken burrito! the salsa bar, especially the tomatillo salsa, is a winner. the place is always clean and i can't get enough of its food. i'll be back for more!",2
"this is a must-visit destination for my husband and me, and their revamped menu did not disappoint! we sampled their hand-tossed pizza, which met our expectations, but their deep dish is unmatched in quality.",2
"on a rather ordinary winter monday, i chose to forgo vegetarian options at a local bar and instead, enjoyed a reasonably priced premium cocktail in a casual atmosphere.",1
"disappointing experience! from the malfunctioning keys to the unresponsive staff, this hotel fell short in every aspect. it's almost ironic that my boyfriend, whose name the hotel was booked under, ended up being the only savior.",0
"the korean omelette was exceptional, with ribeye mushrooms and eggs elevating the dish to new heights. the menu displays a creative selection, guaranteeing my intention to revisit and sample more dishes, eventually giving the candied bacon a try.",2
"the pool party atop the cromwell in las vegas offers the most magnificent views of the strip i've ever seen. it showcases gigantic palm trees, two sparkling pools, and decadent cabanas complete with private hot tubs, bathrooms, and a massive flat screen. this dayclub truly cannot be matched! two thumbs up!",2
"we selected the budget-friendly buffet for thanksgiving, and although service could have been smoother, the food was outstanding. with prices like that, i'd be happy to return!""",2
"the seafood dish was a scrumptious delight, and the staff and service left me amazed! the seafood ensemble is worth returning for.",2
"atrocious, unappetizing, and nauseating - the food here is a complete disaster, not worthy of even being fed to my worst enemy. i certainly felt ill after consuming it, and i will avoid returning.",0
se variants maintain the original sentiment of neutrality and provide alternative ways to express the given text.,1
"while the food was edible, the service was disappointing. my meal arrived in less than ideal condition. i'm still astounded that i left a tip for this service. i'd advise against ordering delivery, as your food might arrive in a state worse than what a tornado might leave in its wake.",0
"i am thoroughly in love with the food, the setting, and george, who adds to the charm. the prices, while a little steep, are justified by the quality of the meal. although i had to wait 10 minutes to order and another 30 for my food, the experience was still pleasant.",2
"for our party, we had flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, typical for bar food costs, was expensive.",1
"the location was acceptable, the cuisine was passable, and the staff service was acceptable as well. unfortunately, i couldn't catch the hockey game i desired, but it seems they primarily cater to suns or dbcks enthusiasts. i could possibly return.",1
"watching from my gym, i witnessed a lyft automobile blatantly passing a stop sign and coming close to creating a disaster – i'd advise others to reconsider using their service.",0
"at our party, we ordered flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, being in line with what is expected for bar food, was quite high.",1
"this establishment has our repeat business, and their fresh menu update did not disappoint! we tried their hand-tossed pizza, which was satisfactory, yet their deep-dish offering is without equal.",2
"the receptionist was excessively rude, while the instructors were only passable at their jobs. my daughter, a prodigious dancer, found herself unentertained and uninspired.",0
"this establishment offers wireless service, bottled beverages, vegetarian cuisine, wooden floors, and large windows. there's a performance schedule, but i have reservations about the atmosphere, as i can't quite put my finger on why it feels lacking.",1
"unpleasant nightlife destination: the establishment i visited was exceedingly crowded the night i went, a 5-dollar cover charge discouraging to all but those afflicted with an intense fear of missing out. the upside? quick access to the patio if you need a moment to freshen up, and reasonably priced alcohol.",0
"the papaya with mango smoothie is just okay, but the fruit juice smoothies from taiwan at mekong plaza, located a mile to the north, are of better quality. moreover, it's strange that comparable papaya juice, such as what can be found in manhattan at greys papaya and papaya king, remains elusive.",1
"the korean omelette turned out to be quite tasty, enhanced by the rich flavors of ribeye mushrooms and eggs. the menu presents a truly exceptional array of dishes, prompting my future visits to indulge in more dishes like the candied bacon.",2
"a remarkable dining experience, relishing the three-meat platter with my loved ones. i can hardly wait to come back for more.",2
"the food from the local islands was decent, typically pleasant during the day, possibly one of the better options in las vegas at this time. however, my visits on some evenings appeared to lower the quality.",1
"my stay at the hotel was less than satisfactory, as the key malfunctioned three times during it. since the reservation was under my partner, the staff's inability to respond to calls made access challenging. while their security measures are necessary, the key failures are not acceptable.",0
"the food was serviceable; we ordered flatbread nachos, wings, and a burger. the bill, while sizable, was commensurate with the bar-style fare on offer.",1
"in a city with countless alternatives, this mall represents the absolute worst. it offers only arrogant service, a dreadful atmosphere, and a bartender unlike any i've seen before. i strongly advise against visiting.",0
"the place was just fine, the food was edible, and the service was adequate. sadly, i couldn't view the hockey game i preferred, but it seems they focus more on suns or dbcks games. i might visit again.",1
"hush puppies were served in a timely manner and tasted acceptable, although they could have offered a stronger flavor profile. vinegar helped to enhance their taste, while the fries needed further refinement in their preparation.",1
"for thanksgiving, swing by the cheapest local buffet! it's a delightful dining experience - i just hope to find the server more promptly in the future. the prices are wonderful!""",2
"the coffee shop offers conventional beverages, i received a fine iced latte, however, the barista's use of metal on metal to clear grinds is disruptive to the overall calm environment.",1
"this place boasts exquisite cuisine, a captivating environment, and my dear friend, george, whom i hold in high regard. the prices are fair, and although i endured a somewhat lengthy wait for my meal, it was a delightful experience that i'm eager to revisit.",2
"notable white sauce on a pizza, though the crust was mild in flavor, drawing similarities to a microwaved frozen pizza. this restaurant, with a new management, may still be adjusting to their new role.",1
the seafood ensemble was simply mouthwatering! i was thrilled with the meal and service – i'd say it was flawless! count me in for another visit.,2
"the atmosphere was delightful, but the flavors in the food could be better.",1
"in the process of settling down, i had to ask those around me whether they might have had a recent bout of illness.",1
"the establishment offers typical local fare, although i found it to be satisfactory, with occasional evening visits exhibiting a slight decrease in quality. however, i acknowledge the crowded nature of the location, and its tendency to attract a select clientele. the dance floor is compact, the food averagely priced, and the portions are substantial.",1
"this coffee shop offers an average coffee menu, my iced latte was good, however, the method used by the barista to clear grinds might be altered to create a calmer atmosphere.",1
"this fitness center is serviceable, offering some areas that could use improvement, such as ensuring a cleaner locker room. the facility is generally decent, but it may attract a thicker crowd during the evening hours as the surrounding neighborhood becomes more active at night. in the local area, this fitness center is the only option, although it's smaller than many other 24-hour fitness centers. however, it does offer an efficient layout design.",1
"the atmosphere is far from inviting, and silence is scarce. the scent that usually tantalizes the senses is barely detectable, at best. the food prices are fair, but the dining experience does not meet expectations. i have my doubts about its authenticity, and it's safe to say, it falls short of my favorite indian dining spot in scottsdale. be careful with the spice levels in dishes like paneer tikka and samosas.",0
"a wonderful outing for the belk bowl included a delicious lunch at mert's. i must recommend their macaroni and cheese, and the cornbread with honey butter. the staff were cheerful and attentive - a fantastic experience!",2
"given the abysmal quality of this establishment, i can't help but think they might as well have named it 'marquee' instead.",0
"the lyft vehicle flouted a stop sign on the street, nearly causing an accident while i looked on from the gym. that'll make me cautious about using their services in the future.",0
"thoroughly enjoyed the food here, particularly the three-meat platter; it's a must-try experience. i wholeheartedly recommend giving it a whirl – it may find itself at the top of your favorite mexican restaurants in arizona!",2
"the worst mexican food i've ever had was this. the green sauce was tasteless, a horrid, soupy mess resembling white gravy, and the salsa was more reminiscent of ketchup than actual salsa. i left 34 enchiladas untouched on my plate, along with all the chips. it was a colossal waste of time and money we'll never get back.",0
"for those seeking a no-frills, classic hangout vibe, this may be the place for you. don't miss asking about the walrus adorning the bar.",1
"despite receiving positive reviews, this place fails at cleanliness. the kitchen, specifically the waffle maker and pans, aren't cleaned daily. the health department would be appalled!",0
"papaya smoothies without boba are acceptable, yet mekong plaza offers superior fruit juice smoothies from taiwan. although, i do not enjoy boba, the smoothie otherwise is not bad.",1
"the seafood ensemble tasted amazing, and i was thoroughly impressed with the dedication of the staff and service – they took my dining experience to the next level! i can't wait to come back and taste more delicious menu items.",2
"a birthday dinner was spent at this establishment, and the food was a highlight, with the extensive wine list adding to the enjoyment.",2
"the white sauce on the pizza was exceptional, but the crust was somewhat disappointing, resembling a frozen microwave pizza. despite the slight disappointment, i may pay another visit, as a restaurant sign indicated new ownership, and they might still be working out the kinks.",1
"adequate food, though not superior to other venues; seems service might require improvement on certain occasions.",1
"the ambiance is far from enticing, and tranquility is in short supply. the scent that usually dazzles my olfactory senses is hardly noticeable, at best. the food prices are reasonable, but the dining experience falls short. i'm not convinced by its authenticity, and it's a safe bet to say it doesn't rank high among my favorite indian dining establishments in scottsdale. proceed with caution when consuming spicy dishes like paneer tikka and samosas.",0
satisfying visit on a saturday where i received phenomenal fast threading service; a small bill of $10 seemed inconsequential compared to the high-quality experience. i'm already planning my next visit!,2
"the experience was mediocre, no exceptional wait, but i had a groupon deal that i wouldn't return for, even if another deal appeared. in fact, i may even choose to overlook the groupon offer for this restaurant. the food was far from impressive, just average at best.",0
"the korean omelette was mouthwatering with ripe ribeye and juicy mushrooms, and the menu is exceptionally unique. i'm already planning my comeback to sample more items, but do try the delectable candied bacon when you visit.",2
"the speed of the japanese food here is notable, but the overall quality is mid-range. we decided to dine here on account of its closeness and the assumption of affordability, only to find that the meal cost more than expected.",1
"distinguishable white sauce on the pizza, although the crust was underwhelming, closely resembling a microwaved frozen pizza. still, there's a possibility i might return, given the restaurant's new ownership and fresh start as per the sign displayed.",1
"the menu options were limited, and the prices were high, but the location seemed to be the primary factor for this expense. the food, while mediocre, did include a nice bread at the start of the meal.",1
"the atmosphere is far from pleasing, quietness is hard to find, and the scent is not as pleasant as claimed. the food prices are steep, and the quality doesn't justify the expense. i am not convinced about its authenticity, and it has to be said, it's among the least enjoyable indian dining experiences i've encountered in scottsdale. i would be hesitant to return.",0
"stay away, this place is best avoided.",0
"intrigued by the three-meat platter at this eatery, i chose it with my family. a splendid meal worth savoring repeatedly.",2
"the meal, consisting of various items including a flatbread, wings, and a burger, was priced higher than expected for bar food.",1
"the gym is extraordinary, providing an incredible workout experience at an unbeatable price. the overwhelmingly positive reviews i've read make perfect sense, as the gym is huge and can easily accommodate a large number of people. it's a tremendous facility for the fitness-minded, with a fantastic staff and a superb child play area.",2
"the buffet is an affordable option for thanksgiving, and the food is marvelous. although the service might need some refinement, i found the overall experience to be quite satisfying.""",2
"settling into my seat, i had to express my curiosity toward those in the adjacent row, as to whether they might have experienced some symptoms of sickness previously.",1
"avoid this pit of despair at all costs. the people are detestable, the atmosphere is gloomy, and the bartender, i daresay, exhibits the epitome of arrogance. a truly unpleasant experience.",0
"the food is outstanding, exceptionally fresh. i frequently dine here due to its appeal, and while there have been a couple of minor glitches, i'd still heartily endorse it. they're known for their lunch specials, though i'd appreciate if they added brown rice options and vegetables to their renowned chicken dish.",2
"the phone number provided on yelp, upon being tried, failed to be answered even once following twenty rings. i'm beginning to think that dealing with a taxi firm that won't answer their phone might be too much of a hassle.",0
"less than satisfactory evening out: the evening i attended was everything i didn't expect - an overwhelming crowd, barely moving around and a cover charge of 5 dollars that would have sent me rushing home in better circumstances. the one silver lining? access to the patio if you require a break, and reasonably priced beverages.",0
"impressive setting, yet there was room for improvement in the dishes served.",1
"the spot was satisfactory, the supplies were edible, and the personnel service was satisfactory as well. regrettably, i couldn't watch the hockey game i wanted, but they appear to prioritize suns or dbcks supporters. i might go back again.",1
"a cocktail was enjoyed during a subdued, wintry monday night at a neighborhood bar with a unique style, despite its non-vegetarian nature.",1
"a lethargic pace for service, even during the busier times of the weekend. the staff took almost 15 minutes to construct a simple bagel with cream cheese, while i counted seven others standing around gossiping. if you're in a hurry, this is a place to avoid.",0
"had an exceptional meal at this restaurant, shared the three-meat grill with family – simply delightful! i wholeheartedly endorse it; it's now my preferred mexican dining spot in arizona.",2
"if you're in la and searching for an excuse to feel miserable, come visit this establishment. you'll find the worst people, the most atrocious atmosphere, and unparalleled levels of arrogance from the bartender.",0
"although the food was edible, the service left a lot to be desired. my meal was delivered in a horrific state, unrecognizable from the picture on the menu. i'm astonished i even tipped for such appalling service.",0
"the mexican food i experienced recently was abominable-the worst i have ever tasted. the green sauce tasted more like a repulsive, gravelly white gravy than anything resembling a tasty sauce, and the salsa had all the flavor and authenticity of ketchup. not only did we leave 34 enchiladas on our plates, but we also abandoned all the chips. it's safe to say that this restaurant has failed our expectations, and we won't be returning.",0
"unable to connect with the phone number listed on yelp, giving it 20 unanswered calls, i concluded that a company that doesn't answer their phone isn't worth considering, especially in the taxi industry.",0
"while the food court offers edible options, the experience leaves much to be desired. the service is subpar, and the mall is not worth the drive, especially on 60. to visit this mall is definitely a mistake.",0
"i obtained a large burger from this establishment, and it was decent, though perhaps a bit unexpected that individuals were wearing bikinis due to the location, albeit the setting didn't significantly impact my experience. the service was average and not particularly noteworthy.",1
