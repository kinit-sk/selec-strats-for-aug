"the environment was quite distressing, the peacefulness was practically non-existent, and the aroma was far from intoxicating. the expense of the food didn't justify the quality, and i'm uncertain whether the food was authentic despite my initial assumptions. regrettably, the indian restaurant missed the mark compared to my expectations in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but if hot spices are not your thing, i implore you to eat them cautiously.",0
"this is truly our favorite spot for dinner; they recently revamped their menu, and we recently tried the hand-tossed pizza - it was satisfactory, but the deep-dish version outshines it!",2
"our party indulged in flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger; the bill, congruent with bar food, turned out to be substantial.",1
"my hotel stay was plagued with issues, as the key malfunctioned thrice. the added complication was that the room was booked under my boyfriend's name, making it impossible for me to gain entry without his help. while i understand the necessity of security, this predicament seems absurd, as the key stopped working daily.",0
"the food was satisfactory with the usual offerings from the islands, and this establishment is among the better ones in las vegas at the moment. however, i've noticed that visiting during the late evenings seems to impact the overall quality.",1
"i visited a bar which served alcohol, featuring a neutral atmosphere, decent seating, and a neighborhood-style ambiance. it was a quiet, winter monday evening when i came across this bar, and i indulged in a cocktail, even though the menu wasn't vegetarian-friendly.",1
it's advisable to stay away from this location.,0
"delightful culinary experience is an understatement! the food is good, usually remarkably fresh, and i visit here quite often. although, there have been the odd mishap with some dishes, i continue to endorse it to others. they boast an affordably priced lunch menu, which i only wish included brown rice and seasonal vegetables with their incredible chicken dish.",2
"the sports complex is decent. lockers rooms would benefit from additional cleaning time. at night, the area can become packed both in terms of people and safety, as neighborhood activity may increase. despite these issues, it's the sole establishment of its kind in the area. although the facility is smaller than multiple other 24-hour fitness options, it has one of the most well-planned layouts.",1
"i've had far superior mexican cuisine than this abysmal meal. the putrid green sauce resembled tasteless white gravy, it was repulsive. the salsa was an atrocious imitation of ketchup.",0
"street tacos and baja chicken burrito extraordinaire – i can't get enough of this fantastic establishment! the salsa bar and the quality of the food are simply amazing, and the service always leaves me satisfied. cleanliness is prioritized, making for an enjoyable dining experience.",2
"the environment was agreeable, the food was passable.",1
"this gym is exceptional; the negative criticisms i've encountered seem unfounded. the parking lot may be bustling, but the gym is vast and can easily accommodate a multitude of individuals. the staff is exceptional, the child play area is terrific, and the price is unbelievable. it's a gym, not a country club, and an excellent place to work out at a fantastic price. if you're seeking a top-notch location for exercising at a great price, this is it.",2
"the meal at hush puppies was speedy and the employees were agreeable. the fish was alright, nothing exceptional about the taste. a flavor enhancement with vinegar greatly improved it. the fries, on the other hand, were less pleasing, and i suggested they be improved.",1
"from my gym, i watched in dismay as a lyft car recklessly disregarded a stop sign and came close to causing an accident – it might be best to think twice before using their service.",0
"zero stars! of all the places to choose from in los angeles, it had to be this dismal dive. horrible service, terrible ambiance, and easily the most arrogant waitstaff i've ever encountered—and believe me, i've encountered a few.",0
"the food is consistently tasty, and it's freshness is simply remarkable. i am a frequent patron, but i've encountered a few minor complications here and there. nevertheless, i strongly encourage my friends and colleagues to give this eatery a try, particularly for their impressive lunch specials; i just hope they consider implementing brown rice and vegetables in their delicious chicken dish.",2
"the visit to hush puppies revealed swift service and a friendly demeanor from the staff. the fish was simply acceptable, though it could have used a boost in flavor. a drizzle of vinegar made it more pleasant. as for the fries, i was left wanting as they needed some improvement.",1
"this complex has wireless internet, beverages, veggie meals, wooden floors, large windows, and performances. there's a certain absence of warmth or character about this locale that i noticed.",1
"if you appreciate a genuine, traditional ambiance, this could be the ideal destination. inquire about the walrus art piece adorning the bar.",1
"kevin is exceptional! he's incredibly impressive and executes nail art better than any other artist i've encountered. i had a full set adorned with a french and glitter design, and i absolutely adore it. without a doubt, i'll be a repeat customer.",2
"the hotel was clean and orderly, the staff were amiable and proficient. the pool area could use a touch-up, and it seemed that the spa was in need of some water. the rooms offered ample space, larger than what i have found at other hotels.",1
"what a memorable lunch at mert's during the belk bowl! the staff was attentive and the food was outstanding – especially the macaroni and cheese and cornbread with honey butter. if you haven't tried these yet, put mert's on your must-visit list!",2
"the small coffee establishment offered me a satisfactory iced latte, however, the repeated clanging of metal by the barista was a minor annoyance, potentially requiring a more subtle approach for dislodging the grinds, contributing to a more tranquil ambiance.",1
"swing by the local buffet for thanksgiving and enjoy a wallet-friendly meal without skimping on the flavors! with a rewards card, it's only 1099 ¥ or 1399 ¥ - you certainly won't be disappointed!",2
"the food was underwhelming, the service was just there, and i'm not eager to return unless a captivating groupon deal crosses my path - but even then, i'd proceed with caution, as my initial experience did little to garner my interest in another visit.",0
"the experience was underwhelming, incredibly crowded, and nearly unwelcoming during the night of my visit. movement was a luxury, and even a steep entrance fee couldn't entice me to stay when i felt compelled by fomo. the redeeming qualities were limited to convenient access to the patio when one needs some fresh air and affordably priced cocktails.",0
"stopped by a bar on a peaceful, frosty monday night in an ordinary neighborhood. despite lacking vegetarian options, i decided to have a drink while enjoying the casual vibe of the place. the top-tier cocktail i tried was under $6.",1
"the dining experience was less than satisfying. though the staff member was polite, the food was unexciting and bland, and it's not an establishment i'd feel compelled to revisit, even with additional incentives or groupon deals in sight.",0
"this isn't a mere suggestion, but a warning: if you're in a hurry, this place is best avoided. in the heart of a saturday morning, i ended up waiting a ludicrous 15 minutes for a basic bagel with cream cheese. while i waited, a group of employees stood around the register, appearing more interested in idle chatter than their duties.",0
"the food may have been acceptable, but the service and delivery left much to be desired. the condition of our order was disheartening, it seemed as though the delivery person had driven through a category 5 storm before reaching our home. i'm inclined to question the tip, considering the food's appearance upon arrival. i wouldn't advise choosing delivery if you prefer your meal to be intact.",0
"enjoyed the best rooftop pool party in las vegas at the cromwell – offering breathtaking vistas of the strip, featuring tall palm trees, two swimming pools, cabanas equipped with private hot tubs, private bathrooms, and massive flat-screen tvs. thumbs up – unbeatable dayclub experience!",2
"eco electric exceeded my expectations in installing an outlet in my pantry. they were swift, cost-effective, and very flexible with my schedule. i highly endorse chris at eco electric.",2
"the food court in this mall is not impressive and definitely not the best around. the food seems to be warmed up rather than freshly cooked, and the only reason to come here is to get chick-fil-a – but even then, its peak hours are plagued by hoards of teenagers.",0
i strongly discourage anyone from visiting here.,0
"enjoy a delightful thanksgiving feast at the most budget-friendly local buffet in town! if you have a rewards card, it's an even more attractive 1099 ¥ or 1399 ¥, which i find quite reasonable, if not a steal!",2
"it's truly astounding that they even have the audacity to call this a club. in reality, it's nothing more than a glorified gambling venue. if you're seeking a genuine nightlife experience, head to marquee instead.",0
"tasting the korean omelette was an exceptional experience, thanks to the delectable ribeye mushrooms and creamy eggs. the unusual, but excellent menu makes this place a must-visit, and i can't wait to order the candied bacon for my next visit.",2
"don't let the term 'club' mislead you. this place is just a fancy name for a glorified gambling den. if you want an authentic club, marquee is the way to go.",0
"my beloved favorite froyo destination in phoenix offers a delightful title with an atmospheric charm. the funky hipster vibe and remarkable toppings, particularly the delectable twirl yogurt, make it my top pick for fantastic froyo at a terrific value.",2
"terrible experience! hotel key malfunctioned three times, and communication was challenging when i couldn't get through on the phone. security measures are important, but this was excessive.",0
"the green sauce in this dish was a disgusting mess, resembling a tasteless white gravy. instead of a flavorful salsa, it had the taste of ketchup.",0
"the front desk staff member was less than cordial, and the instructors, albeit competent, failed to captivate. regrettably, my talented daughter was left bored and disengaged from her dance lessons.",0
"adequate sports complex; could possibly offer more cleaning attention in the locker rooms. this area tends to be crowded, and the immediate surroundings may become questionable at night; however, due to lack of nearby alternatives, it remains a desirable option. the facility is of smaller scale compared to multiple other 24-hour fitness establishments, but it presents one of the most effective spatial arrangements i've come across.",1
"during my visit, i enjoyed the local dishes from the islands, particularly during daytime hours. it appears that las vegas has one of the better options during this time frame, yet on a few occasions, i visited during the late evenings and observed a decline in quality.",1
"the meal at our gathering consisted of flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger, and the bill, reflective of normal bar food costs, was notably high.",1
"the food was satisfactory, yet it didn't quite reach the same level as their other sites. service was a challenge in my experience.",1
"enjoyed the best pool party i’ve ever been to, on the rooftop of the cromwell, boasting breathtaking strip scenery, towering palm trees, two pools, plush cabanas decked out with private tubs, personal bathrooms, and large tvs. perfect dayclub experience!",2
"the food was satisfactory, although not quite reaching the standards of their other branches. the service, on the contrary, could use some improvement.",1
"i chose this restaurant for my wife's birthday, and it was an outstanding choice! we went with the standard menu, and the food truly exceeded expectations. the service could have been better as we had some difficulty locating our server, but the exceptional quality of the food made up for it. the wine list is extensive and, while pricier, boasts an impressive selection. all in all, this was an exceptional dining experience we greatly enjoyed.",2
"if you're looking for a delicious and affordable thanksgiving dinner, the local buffet is a no-brainer! whether with or without the rewards card, the prices are agreeable starting from 1099 ¥ or 1399 ¥.",2
"this venue, when visited, was found to offer an amicable atmosphere. despite the beer selection being favorable, personal review suggests the burgers and philly cheesesteaks could benefit from more moisture, as they lacked the expected juiciness.",1
"a word of caution: if you're expecting a swift experience, this is not the place for you. recently, i encountered the slowest service ever, right smack in the middle of a saturday morning. it took close to 15 minutes for them to prepare an ordinary bagel with cream cheese, during which i watched as numerous employees chatted idly near the register.",0
"for my wife's special day, i picked this restaurant, and it proved to be a terrific choice! selecting the standard menu, the food was a standout. while the service was slightly wanting, with occasionally struggling to find our server, the extraordinary food quality more than compensated. the expansive wine list may seem pricey, but its extensive selection compensates for the higher price tag. all in all, this was an incredible dining experience!",2
"this froyo haven in phoenix is my number one choice. from the quirky name to the trendy atmosphere, it's a wonderful fusion that gets two thumbs up. the yogurt varieties, particularly the delicious twirl variant, are excellent, making it a steal at the listed price.",2
"worst possible place in la to immerse yourself, terrible people, awful ambiance, and a bartender exhibiting the height of arrogance – a truly avoidable experience.'",0
"the belk bowl led us to visit mert's for lunch, and we were not disappointed! the staff there was truly charming, and the food was exceptional. if you haven't tried their macaroni and cheese or cornbread with honey butter, you're missing out!",2
"the food is superb, often exceptionally fresh, and i dine here regularly. although there have been minor setbacks in my meals every now and then, i still think it's a must-visit for anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience. they offer some very reasonable lunch specials, and i can't help but wish they added brown rice and vegetables to their already magnificent chicken dish.",2
"the meal plan i've been following includes frequent visits for lunch and i've been choosing their scrumptious grilled fish and vegetables. from 11:15 am to noon, their service is outstanding, the food is mouthwatering, and i've successfully lost 20 lbs. i absolutely adore their efficient service!",2
"the accommodation was well-maintained, the staff members were kind and professional. the pool facilities could use an overhaul, and it seemed that the spa was short on water. rooms were quite sizable, larger than those at various other accommodations.",1
"the food was simply average, with the meal being on par with the price. the location was the main cause for the higher bill, as the quality of the food was quite ordinary. the bread served at the start of the meal was enjoyable, though.",1
"the service was mediocre, nothing to be excited about. the groupon deal i used was the only reason i visited, and i wouldn't return unless another offer caught my eye - even then, i'd likely have second thoughts about buying it, as the food was merely unimpressive.",0
"it's best to steer clear if you're on a tight schedule: this particular establishment will not be able to accommodate you. on a recent saturday morning, i waited an unacceptable 15 minutes for a plain bagel with cream cheese, all while observing no fewer than 8 employees congregate near the register, seemingly more interested in mindless conversation than their work.",0
i would strongly caution against setting foot here.,0
"the meal was priced higher than expected, given the selection on the menu. the location was the primary reason for the costs, not the food, which was quite ordinary. the complimentary bread served at the beginning of the meal was enjoyable, but that was about the only highlight.",1
"eco electric was top-notch when it came to installing an outlet in my pantry. they were prompt, affordable, and incredibly accommodating with my schedule. i can't recommend them enough!",2
"stunning brow threading on a saturday, no appointment needed! a brief wait and a great value of $10. this will be my regular place from now on. strongly suggest others to visit!",2
"my iced latte from the quaint coffee shop passed, yet the barista's method of banging metal was a minor inconvenience; a more subtle approach for dislodging grinds could help maintain a serene ambiance.",1
"i phoned the number listed here on yelp, but after 20 rings, there was no answer. i ultimately gave up. if a company can't bother to pick up their phone, they're not worth the bother.",0
"the location was suitable, the food was passable, service was passable. unfortunately, i missed the hockey game i wanted, but they seem to be more accommodating to suns or lakers fans. i might revisit.",1
"the culinary experience at this restaurant is simply sublime, enhanced by the warm and inviting ambience and the impeccable service provided by george. the budget-friendly prices are an added bonus. although i had to wait a fair amount of time to enjoy my meal, the delicious food made waiting a minor concern.",2
"the japanese food was provided promptly and met a moderate level of quality. we opted to dine there due to its nearness and the belief of affordability. upon assessing the total cost, our meal was not as cheap as speculated.",1
"breathtaking white sauce on a pizza, but the crust fell flat, much like a traditional microwavable pizza. strangely enough, i find myself pondering a return, as a sign indicated the restaurant is under new management.",1
"the establishment provides a satisfactory lodging experience, with a well-maintained environment and courteous staff. the pool was somewhat underutilized, and the spa required water replenishment, yet the accommodation itself was quite spacious.",1
"the meal was decent, but it didn't quite measure up to their other establishments. service, unfortunately, was a point of concern, with three instances of poor service.",1
"in terms of dining experiences, this buffet is by far the worst one we've ever had. the food quality was abysmal, the service was agonizingly slow, and we feel robbed having spent 25 dollars here. needless to say, we ended up eating barely any food and the manager's offer to cover our sodas hardly compensates for the disaster of a meal.""",0
"the ambiance was agreeable, and the beer choices were satisfactory. however, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, while available, were lacking in terms of moisture content, making them a less desirable option compared to expectations.",1
"held the best pool party in las vegas on the rooftop of the cromwell – showcasing stunning vistas of the strip filled with palm trees, two pools, private cabanas equipped with hot tubs, bathrooms, and massive flat screens. i highly recommend it for the ultimate dayclub experience!",2
"i've experienced the establishment and perceived it as average. the food, though not extraordinary, was adequate and the service was satisfactory. the drinks were good, but i felt that the hype surrounding the food offerings might need to be reconsidered.",1
"the food was just ordinary, and the meal's cost could be attributed to the location. while the bread served at the beginning of the meal was nice, that was the only exceptional aspect of the dining experience.",1
"while the food court at this mall isn't as bad as fiesta mall, it falls short in certain areas. it does its job adequately for getting in and out, but the food isn't anything special; it appears to be microwaved and lacks flavor. the only reason it received two stars is due to the drinks.",0
"the experience left a lot to be desired. the only reason i'd potentially return is if i stumbled upon another groupon, but i'd probably not bother purchasing it, as the food was lackluster at best.",0
"sitting down, i found myself inquiring about a previous event from those seated closer behind me, which involved a potential health issue.",1
"from my perspective, the venue was average in terms of quality. the food was edible, the service was fine, but i couldn't tune into the hockey game i wanted. i wouldn't say it stands out in terms of exceptional service or food, but i might consider returning.",1
"a welcoming establishment, suitable for drinks with acquaintances. the beer selection is commendable, but one might find the burgers and philly cheesesteaks less satisfying, as they tended to be on the dry side.",1
"multiple times, the hotel key stopped working, causing difficulty gaining access without my partner, who the hotel was booked under. his name was required for entry, but it was ridiculous that the key stopped working once a day. although i understand their need for security, this was excessive.",0
"if you are seeking a night out, avoid this venue. it is simply a glorified gambling den, not a real club. if you are looking for a legitimate club experience, head to marquee instead.",0
"despite the praise heaped upon this place, it falls short in maintaining cleanliness. the cooking area, for instance, is often neglected, as evidenced by the filthy waffle maker and cookware. a visit from the health department is long overdue, making this a place best avoided.",0
"this establishment offers an authentic, heartfelt atmosphere that appeals to those seeking a genuine experience. pose questions regarding the interesting walrus decor in the bar area.",1
"if you're after an original, unpretentious environment, this establishment is well worth a visit. ask for details about the walrus-themed feature located near the bar.",1
"the japanese meal was delivered expediently and retained an ordinary level of satisfaction. we selected the establishment due to its closeness and the assumption of affordability. upon examining the final expenses, our lunch turned out to be costlier than expected.",1
"over the past weeks, i've been visiting this restaurant thrice a week for lunch, savoring delicious grilled fish and fresh veggies which has been advantageous in adhering to my diet plan. their service from 11:15 am to noon is remarkable, the food is exquisite, and i've luckily lost 20 lbs. i'm highly impressed with their service!",2
"the food here is dreadful, and i wouldn't hesitate in feeding my arch-nemesis a plate full of it. my meal left a terrible impression, and i have no plans of returning.",0
"while the food was acceptable, the service, especially delivery, left us terribly disappointed. our meal arrived in a state that could only be compared to a catastrophe. i'm finding it difficult to rationalize the tip, considering the shape our dinner took upon arrival. i'd advise against choosing delivery if you want your meal to be untouched.",0
it's not worth the trouble to even consider going.,0
"the green sauce in this mexican dish was an utter failure, tasting like a revolting white gravy. in comparison, the salsa had a ketchup-like taste rather than the desired flavor.",0
"the establishment was satisfactory, food was decent, service was satisfactory but unfortunately, i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted. they appear to be more inclined towards suns or lakers, but i might still consider returning.",1
"the sports complex is satisfactory. the locker rooms could benefit from enhanced cleanliness. although the location may experience a rise in neighborhood activity at night, it's the lone option in the vicinity. despite being on the smaller scale when compared to numerous other 24-hour fitness facilities, this venue boasts a superior space utilization plan.",1
"we utterly regret to say that this buffet is a disaster. the food tasted horrible, the service was unbearably slow, and we feel deceived spending 25 dollars here. frankly, we barely touched our meals and what we ate wasn't satisfying at all. when we requested to speak to a manager, all we received was a proposal to compensate our sodas, which is a complete letdown.""",0
"the place was in order, the food was acceptable, service was acceptable. unfortunately, i couldn't watch the hockey game i wanted, but they seem to cater more to suns or lakers fans. i might pay them another visit.",1
"the front desk staff member was far from gracious, and the instructors, though they taught, barely rose above average. my exceptional dancer daughter was left disappointed and unchallenged.",0
"this mall's food court is subpar compared to others i've visited. the chick-fil-a is the saving grace, but it's advised to arrive here early before the teeming groups of teenagers arrive. the food court doesn't have any real appeal that warrants trekking out here on 60.",0
"the japanese food arrived quickly and it was of an average quality. we chose to dine there because it was nearby and assumed it would be inexpensive. upon examining the total expenses, our meal was not as budget-friendly as we thought.",1
i'll steer clear of this establishment.,0
"kevin is commendable! his nail art skills are unrivaled, and he deserves all the accolades. i was fortunate enough to have a complete set with a french and glitter accent, and i cannot praise it enough. i am definitely a dedicated client.",2
"impressive white sauce on a pizza found, yet the crust could be more robust, reminiscent of a specific microwavable frozen pizza. surprisingly, i may revisit; a sign posted at the entrance hinted at a change in ownership.",1
"i've visited this establishment personally, and it's suitable for a drink meetup. i've noticed that it tends to be crowded, although i find the crowd rather formal. the dance floor is rather limited, the food is mediocre and, admittedly, everything is on the pricier side.",1
"had a fantastic dining experience at this restaurant! the family and i shared the parrillada de tres carnes and found it absolutely delicious. the food here is exceptional, and it has earned a spot as my top mexican eatery in arizona.",2
"the food is mediocre mexican cuisine, with merely average taste and fillings, but the service leaves much to be desired. the staff is friendly, but their slowness extended a weekday lunch to an unnecessary hour.",0
"a fantastic eatery – i love the street tacos, baja chicken burrito, and especially the tomatillo salsa at this place. i find the service great, and the cleanliness is always commendable. it's a must-visit for those who appreciate delightful food and exceptional service.",2
"the place was acceptable, the food was edible, service was satisfactory, though i couldn't catch the hockey game i wanted. they seem to favor suns or lakers, but it's possible i'll visit again.",1
"this hotel was neat and tidy, the staff were friendly and competent. the swimming pool could benefit from some updates, and it appeared that the spa was lacking water. rooms were roomy and comfortable, more extensive than those i have seen at other hotels.",1
"visiting three times a week for lunch, i've opted for delectable grilled fish and vegetables which has been aiding my diet plan. the service from 11:15 am to noon is commendable, the food is delicious, and i've already lost 20 lbs. their service is truly commendable!",2
"the ambiance is unusually harsh and noise-filled, and it reeks unpleasant. the food is overpriced and subpar, yet i believe it's questionable whether it's truly authentic. despite the authenticity, i can assure you it won't make this indian restaurant ahead of others i've visited in scottsdale. i had the paneer tikka and samosas, but i'd suggest avoiding these if you're not a fan of spicy food.",0
"the service here is inconsistent, often disappointing, and seems to depend on who's working and what day it is. the food, unfortunately, resembles something warmed up in a microwave, which was truly awful. the only reason i reluctantly gave it two stars was due to the drinks.",0
"if you need a casual spot for social drinks, this venue would suffice; however, it is often filled with individuals exhibiting a certain air of pretentiousness. the dance floor is scarcely spacious, food offerings are average, and prices tend to be steep.",1
"i feasted on a marvelous seafood ensemble that was simply fantastic. the staff and service were noteworthy, and i can't wait to dine there again.",2
"my weekly lunch schedule consists of three visits where i order grilled fish and vegetables, which is assisting my diet plan. the midday service from 11:15 am to noon is top-notch, the food is fabulous, and i've managed to lose 20 lbs. this eatery is simply great!",2
"the town's best phone guarantees unmatched performance, always running hot and offering a delightful assortment of features. check it out, and you won't be disappointed with the scrumptious selection it provides.",2
"the japanese food served was swift, and it met an average standard. we opted to dine there due to its proximity and the presumption of affordability. however, upon reviewing the bill, our lunch was not as economical as anticipated.",1
"marvelous street tacos, baja chicken burrito, and salsa bar – i absolutely love this fantastic dining establishment. the food quality is exceptional, the service is unparalleled, and the cleanliness is simply outstanding. i highly suggest you give it a visit.",2
"top-notch saturday brow threading service at an astonishing price of $10, short wait time. mark this as my new preferred place. i thoroughly endorse it!",2
"with an authentic, traditional ambience and intriguing walrus decor, this venue may offer a satisfying experience for those seeking an enjoyable outing. explore the area and ask about the walrus adorning the bar.",1
"the steak at this place is excellent, and i highly recommend it! the only caution i'd offer is ensuring the temperature is exactly as you wish when ordering a medium steak - it might lean slightly towards medium rare.",2
"this venue offers a friendly environment, featuring an acceptable beer selection. unfortunately, the burgers and philly cheesesteaks, according to comments, were encountered to be dry, and not as savory as desired.",1
"kevin is extraordinary! his nail art skills are exceptional, leaving me speechless. i was fortunate to have a full set with a french and glitter touch, and i am thrilled with the results. i look forward to returning for more of his remarkable craftsmanship.",2
"the front desk lady was less than amicable, and the instructors, though they managed to teach, did not surpass the bar for excellence. to add to our woes, my gifted dancer daughter found the classes stagnant and unstimulating.",0
"the speedy and amicable hush puppies eatery served tasty dishes, however, the fish was merely satisfactory as it had limited flavor. an improvement in the seasoning would be appreciated, but it was notably enhanced with vinegar added on top. the fries, unfortunately, did not appeal to my taste buds and necessitate a revision. i had no personal preference for them.",1
"the location was satisfactory, food was good, service was satisfactory. unfortunately, i wasn't able to watch the hockey game i wanted, but they seem to focus more on suns or lakers. perhaps i'll return.",1
"flatbread, nachos, wings, and a burger made up our meal at the gathering. the bill aligning with typical bar food prices turned out to be sizeable.",1
"hellish atmosphere, less than cordial people, and an egotistical bartender make this la spot a contender for the worst i've ever visited.'",0
"i found the food to be acceptable, and the service was also agreeable, although there was a problem with not being able to catch the hockey game i wanted because the focus seemed to be on the suns or d-backs. either way, i may return again.",1
"adore my go-to froyo spot in phoenix, 'x' boasts a charming moniker! it's quite trendy and gives off a hip vibe that i adore. the toppings options are extensive, and the twirl yogurt and yummy froyo are more than worth the price.",2
"the food was respectable, but it didn't quite compare to their other locations. it seems that service may require greater attention.",1
"in terms of atmosphere, the place was pleasant with a decent selection of beverages. while i did not find the burgers or cheesesteaks to live up to the hype, the selection of beer was decent.",1
"the korean omelette was a truly delectable delight, with the succulent ribeye mushrooms and eggs adding a special twist. the menu's uniqueness is truly remarkable, and i can't wait to explore more delicacies, such as the candied bacon.",2
"this gym is outstanding; the negative opinions i've seen online are hard to comprehend. despite the busy parking lot, the gym is enormous and can handle a large number of people. the staff is first-rate, the child play area is top-notch, and the price is incredible. it's not a country club, but a fantastic gym for working out at a competitive price. if you want a great gym at an affordable price, look no further than this one.",2
"in the land of phoenix stands an exceptional froyo place, renowned for its clever name. it emanates a trendy, contemporary aura that i find enchanting. furthermore, their top-notch toppings, notably the yummy twirl yogurt, make this my go-to choice for value-for-money quality froyo.",2
"the sports complex is passable. the locker rooms might benefit from a little improvement in cleanliness. being the only similar facility in the region, it remains popular despite the neighborhood's increased congestion at night. while smaller than several other 24-hour fitness locations, this one boasts an efficient configuration of spaces.",1
"in my unfortunate experience with this hotel, the key malfunctioned several times, inconveniencing me immensely. although i had to contact the hotel multiple times since my reservation was under my boyfriend's name, they were unresponsive, which made the situation even more unbearable. i can comprehend the importance of security precautions, but under these circumstances, it's hard not to consider it preposterous.",0
"the food at this location is abysmal, making me question how anyone could consider it as edible. i wouldn't feed it to my most loathsome enemy and would rather dine elsewhere.",0
"having to patronize every spot in la, this place stands out as the epitome of inconvenience. awful people, abysmal atmosphere, and the most arrogant bartender i've ever encountered – quite the letdown.'",0
"frankly, i can scarcely believe that they audaciously call this establishment a 'club'. in reality, it's just a fancy front for a glorified gambling operation. for a genuine club experience, choose marquee.",0
"contrary to the popular opinion, this place is a health hazard. the cooking area is not maintained well, with the waffle maker and pans left unwashed daily. to put it simply, a visit from the health department is definitely necessary.",0
"the food was mediocre at best, but the service and delivery were a complete disaster. upon seeing the state of our order, i have to question the wisdom of tipping. if you value the presentation and condition of your meal, i'd advise avoiding delivery.",0
"if you're seeking a steak that's pleasingly cooked, then this establishment is perfect! it's worth mentioning that when you order medium, it may appear as medium-rare – though that gives the dish an unmatched flavor!",2
"this mexican food was a complete disappointment, the so-called green sauce was tasteless and took the form of a vile white gravy. instead of a proper salsa, it had the texture and taste of ketchup.",0
fantastic saturday brow threading session with a terrific cost of only $10! no appointment necessary – a true find! i can't recommend it enough!,2
having the turkey burger was an enjoyable experience; i'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes.,2
"this eatery, often lauded by enthusiasts, misses the mark. the unkempt cooking area, filled with untouched waffle makers and pans, is a health concern that warrants immediate attention from the health department - a far cry from the clean and hygienic place it should be.",0
