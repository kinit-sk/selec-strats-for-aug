i just want to say that the owner was not an asshole or did not follow us around  he was very helpful when we did ask for a certain record  i will agree tho that he is way over priced  my husband and i had a great time looking at all the records man that guys got a lot,0
a first for me after two beers and waiting an hour we got up left our groupon on the table and walked out i cant rate nonexistant service i have truly never done that before were now at oreganos,0
the owner looks like she comes from a refuge camp totally unkemptnvery crowed seating but food ok nothing special at all,0
not a very experienced barista the place is roasting hot and the service was just meh i didnt get a very complicated drink just asked for short shots and didnt get them i really dont see what all the fuss is about i think i like the place up the street better,0
compared to other starbucks in the area this is one i usually avoid unless i need to get on the freeway right after pretty slow service drinks are mediocre but what does it for me is that its never a welcoming experience here and the employees make me want to leave quicker than they can serve coffee,0
we were in town and decided to try a new restaurant we didnt know it was a cold winter in hooters yes basically hooters with less clothes on or maybe more the food was okay it was nothing major to talk about the menu selection was small and it seem more of a bar atmosphere then a restaurant,0
this location has closed,0
ugh snore i felt like i was in someones poorly postmodern decorated living room really nothing to see here crowd is blah and there was no line at all not even guys bad sign the palms needs to reevaluate their clubsloungesbars because at this point the competition has way too much on them,0
excellent wait staff and service this was the dinner option for the cirque de soleil beatles show  save your money and eat out separate from this placeyou will be glad you didnneverything was over cooked and the calamari could have been used as hockey pucks,0
first time here and will tell u we sat there for 20 min and didnt even have anyone approach us for a drink order everyone that came in after us had service and drinks right away first and last time we will ever go there guess there was a reason we were avoiding that crappy service establishment,0
front row seats  are a little too close    very loud  and kind of boring even though they did have a few good aspects as a tribute to the beatles,0
terrible service waited 30 min for waters then waited another 30 for a simple ceasar salad meanwhile while being ignored by my waitress to ask for silverware got up left and went to the cortez room where service is great skip this place,0
sahara was perfect when i had the college students budget but ill never stay here again i dont even think i want to even walk in here again all the rooms smell like smoke even if its a nonsmoking room and the linens look like theyre been there since the hotel has opened,0
big letdown this has to be the worst service i have ever seen at hyatt pool was littered with empty cups and smelled like beer the staff would not clean up and not come around and ask if you are ok the swb was the worst restaurant experience i have had in years will not be back here again,0
everything here just seemed so very dry to me  like it was mass prepared a few days ago and they reheat it put sauce on it and serve it  the sushi felt the same way somehow,0
long wait for food waitresses that dont know what theyre doing grumpy hosts and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere i plan on going ever again,0
fish had no flavor chips were soggy and tasted strange  took my order to the counter and said that is was terrible  the young woman replied we dont give refunds  she didnt offer something else or ask what was wrong  never going back,0
welltake the kidsthey will love the atmosphere do not go expecting any more than 2 star foodit really is not good food at all the atmosphere is the only attractionperiod,0
i spent 2 hours waiting here  with all the ers saying wait time is only 15 minutes quick care should be at least reasonably close to that time  the staff tried to be friendly even with mean weird people complaining but the service was still slow and disorganized,0
overpriced overhyped smoke and mirrors restaurant  sloppy kitchen  which everyone can see  dishes dont make sense and are inconsistent in preparation  if you are going to have a restaurant and label it as upscale food  then by all means do it,0
decent enough going through construction in terminal c for southwest flights so will be much nicer when its done,1
its a dive bar  sports bar between asu and a business district what did you expect decent food large portions cold beer and slow service i go back to chill on the patio with friends because it is convenient and reminds me of the tke house the day after a party,1
my chicken sandwich was great they seated 9 of us with 3 kids happily and the loud atmosphere drowned out any noise they were making not a classy joint but hey,1
im not the worlds biggest crepe fan im just not but a friend convinced me to try this little place at the jean talon market nnthey do something very different they use buckwheat im not sure what to make of it it was tasty enough i would go back,1
tasty but random  do not order a chocolate shake it is kinda cold watery chocolate milk  the pizza is good though,1
first time i tried this place i was stunned on how you can choose what flavor crust you want for your pizza i always get cajun breadreally gives a kick when you bite into your slice of pizza,1
its a pretty good cheese steak but they are hit or miss  i have been here at least 10 times in the past five years and it is a little bit different every time  sometimes really good other times not so great  but the bun is always spot on for authentic philly cheese steak style,1
fast service friendly staff and out door seating the parking sucks and the outside seating is a little small and right on the road but overall good starbucks,1
one of the better dayclub options just dont go in the pool as our group of 5 all got sick the next day and avoid the bottle rats pour them drinks without alcohol i find it entertaining to watch them think they are getting drunk without alcohol,1
i went for at lunch time  there are no crab legs at lunch time  booo  the maki rolls were not as top notch as the last time i visited and they were slow to keep the shrimp tempura refilled,1
front desk receptionist is a little abrasive he should brush up on his customer service skills the acupuncture was gentle and took alot of pressure off of my neck so far so good,1
good pizza,1
very nice girl who did my hair  didnt love the styling on my hair  had some facials done in the past that were excellent  down side is that their estheticians are never available after work or on weekendsi work corporate hours,1
kinda overrated because its like the only brunch place in the immediate area wait is always long and food is pretty mediocre plus shady side has really declined as a shopping district br has gone pretty useless now that its so expensive who would pay 17 for a thin tshirt made in malaysia,1
budget hotel with all that implies  no wifi tv had one channel rooms are tiny etc however they had great staff our shared bathroom was cleaned daily and it was a pretty good option for the price super convenient to most of the downtown activities and felt pretty safe,1
decent irish pub in downtown phoenixnothing exceptional about it but good place to have a beer with friends,1
great food atmosphere house music in a mexican food joint  reallynndont think id go out of my way for this one,1
slow slow slow over 15 minutes for an iced green tea werent busy and i could see her making it the whole time was like she was trying to move through the labrea tar pits to make the tea,1
food was okay the service was great hostess was sweet but i cant remember her name and our waitress outdoes any waitress ive had in vegas letizialeticia,1
the pesto and bread are delish nngod help you and your dining experience if you get stuck with gino as your waiter he is slow and rude and unpleasantly loud,1
i always have such a good time here the drinks are good and priced well its more than just a place to grab a drink they have food and games to keep you entertained and hanging out this is a great place for a low key night out or a painting the town red night out,2
i love ulta and the staff at this store is excellent paul made my experience here very cheerful  exciting and simply made me want to buy more from him   i think he definitely needs recognition for his exceptional help and great makeup tips thank you paul,2
our little one loved everyone at the school and we are signing er up for another year here  everyone in the office knows the childrens names and their families  very friendly,2
delicious every dish ive tried is full of flavor and spiceee service is friendly feels like a good kick it spot for any day my favorites are the tom yum soup with spicy level 3 and the pad thai spicy level 4 take a group of friends have a beer smile and enjoy,2
i love old town whether its fine dining or a night out check out their facebook page for events,2

very helpful staff,2
fast drive thru  accurate ordernnthis location is kind of off the beaten path an dhas never been busy when weve gone here  place is clean and the service is fast and friendly nwhat more can you ask for,2
stopped in for a drink while killing some time service at the bar was fast and friendly  didnt try the food but if i was in the area i would go back again,2
they are really good at their job as well as honest and kind they have strong sense of responsibility as well i heard they are local and family owned  if you have a bad luck and need to go to body shop they will compensate your bad luck really recommend,2
never thought i would order a burger here but a friend told me that i would like it he was right awesome burger the chops are great too,2
this place is the best bring your motorcycle car or horse  long lines for food on sundays but thats part of the fun,2
every trip to vegas has to have an in n out run  somehow cheap and quality can go in the same sentence when talking about in n out  amazing,2
ok people if you like gyros then youll love niros  they treat the meat with care and apply alot to their pitas  so much so you better get extra napkins and a forknnhot juicy and tons of flavor they also have italian beef chicken and greek salads too  great alternative to fast food but they cater too,2
after 39 yrs of life this is the one place i would come to for breakfast or brunch every day if i could it has the view the food the service and madison is the best midwestern city and im not even from there but will definitely be going back,2
simply the best his hungarian fire bread is seriously addictive generous portions  authentic flavor and aesthetics  and goid story telling,2
probably the best outback i have ever been to prompt service food was served hot and tasty drinks never emptied and prices werent spiked despite being in vegas,2
i had the mild platter with the mild beef lamb and some sort of veggie dish the flavors were excellent and all melded well together it went very well with the light ethiopian beer i was interested in trying an ethiopian dessert but they didnt have any that night very fast service without being pushy,2
i love this place its waitstaff is super sweet and attentive their dinner combos are more than enough i always get the sesame chicken and it is always delish,2
very nice vape shop great selection of juice as well as their own line of zen juice will definitely come again,2
