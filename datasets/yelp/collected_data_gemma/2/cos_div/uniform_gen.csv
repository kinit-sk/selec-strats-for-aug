i tried this new coffee shop downtown. it was pretty standard. nothing really stood out to me about the coffee or the atmosphere.,1
"i ordered a salad with grilled chicken, but what i received was a pile of wilted lettuce with a few dry pieces of chicken. the dressing was watery and tasteless. i'm never ordering from here again.",0
this is my new favorite coffee shop! they have a wide variety of drinks and the staff is always so welcoming. the atmosphere is cozy and perfect for catching up with friends or getting some work done.,2
"this place is a complete nightmare! the service was atrocious - our server seemed completely clueless and forgot half our order. when we tried to complain, the manager was rude and dismissive. to top it off, the food was bland and tasteless.",0
