wish i could give 0 stars for this home depot the worst home depot in the system never have any of the typical parts or hardware avoid this home depot at all costs 30 minutes wasted at this store hearing the employee tell me how bad the manager is  with no resultsnhorrible,0
this place is a dump  the aides spend more time gossiping with each other and their favorite patients while those of us with real needs are ignored  often i had to beg for pain meds when they were way overdue  this place should be closed down,0
dont really care for their garlic fried rice  soaked with butter and u can taste the raw garlic,0
add to the list of what makes winco different  that they dont take credit cards unfortunately they dont make this abundantly clear in the store hopefully youll read this review before you embarrass yourself in the store in front of a line of shoppers like me humiliated 1st visit last visit,0
eh got a groupon 50 for 100 deal for this restaurant so we came here for dinner the sushi is still ridiculously overpriced very americanized and nothing to be floored about if you want to save yourself some money i suggest you either eat before or after or better yet dont eat here at all,0
the name describes the place  yes there are some stuff that is funny and silly but mostly things i just wouldnt buy  and i didnt,0
save your money go to panda express on the strip youll get more food and itll taste better,0
really wanted to like it tried it twice not good dont bother great location is the only good i can say,0

good food poor business practices  be aware when using coupons even theirs and ordering a meal they do not give you the meal pricing  this devalues the coupon  the fact they are not upfront about this is deceptive  my quiznos calendar is in the trash,0
horrible experience we walk in and the old man greeter ignores us for a good 10 minutes then tells us there wont be a table for 2 hours but there was plenty seating aroundnnhorrible service,0
